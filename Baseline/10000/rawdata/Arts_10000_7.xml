==Biography==
Anders Monsen Askevold was born in [[Askvoll]], in [[Sunnfjord]], Norway. He was the second oldest of ten siblings. His father was a teacher. His early training started at the age of thirteen in [[Bergen]] under landscape painter [[Hans Leganger Reuch]] (1800-1854) . He was educated as a painter in [[Düsseldorf]], but continued his studies in [[Paris]] and [[Munich]]. Askevold came to Düsseldorf in 1855 and stayed for 3 years. He trained in Düsseldorf under [[Hans Gude]] from 1855 until 1859.  Askevold did some commissions for several altarpieces in Norway including the [[Askvoll]] church in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Anders_Askevold/utdypning'' Anders Askevold/utdypning'' (Store norske leksikon)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known as a member of the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]] with others like [[Adelsteen Normann]]. From 1861 to 1866 he was in [[Paris]]. In 1866 Askevold moved back to Norway and settled in [[Bergen]]. After this he moved back to Düsseldorf where he would spend his winters in Germany and his summers in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/askevold_anders_monsen_figures_cattle_stream.htm Figures and Cattle by a Forest Stream], artoftheprint.com, accessed April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

His paintings were shown at numerous international exhibitions, including world exhibitions in [[London]] (1862), [[Paris]] (1867) and (1878), [[Vienna]] (1873) and [[Philadelphia]] (1876). In Vienna and Philadelphia, he was honored with medals. In 1884, in London he won the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Anders_Askevold ''Anders Askevold - Dyremaler, Maler (Norsk biografisk leksikon. Forfatter av denne artikkelen, Ingrid Reed Thomsen)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Askevold died in 1900 in [[Düsseldorf]]. A monument was erected in his honor by the municipality of Askvoll during 1934. 
Both the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]]  in [[Oslo]] and [[Bergen]] Billedgalleri have notable collections of his art. A painting by Askevold sold for over £5,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5121315 Lot 101 Sale 2801], Christies.com, 2009, accessed April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artexte''' (in French: Centre d'information '''''Artexte''''') is an independent, federally chartered [[not-for-profit]] arts organization in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Its principal mandate is to focus on research, interpretation and dissemination initiatives in order to broaden the influence and appreciation of contemporary visual arts. These activities are informed by a significant collection of art documentation and authoritative resources, as well as a network of multidisciplinary partners. Artexte's partnerships and alliances are built with others who also seek to bring attention to the value of documentation produced by the study and practice of [[contemporary art]]. Artexte affirms the presence of experimental, innovative and critical components of this field. Its activities touch on all aspects of contemporary visual art from 1965 to today, with special emphasis placed on [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]].

Through its bilingual reference services and research assistance, the Centre provides a user-friendly interface between its collection and researchers from Canada and abroad.

==History==
Established in 1980 by art historian Francine Périnet and artists [[Angela Grauerholz]] and [[Anne Ramsden]], Artexte began as a bookstore specializing in Canadian and International contemporary art. The organization responded to an essential need in Quebec and Canada for up to date, accurate information on contemporary visual art.
In order to realize their objective of disseminating this information, the founders opened a documentation centre in [[Montreal]]. They then created Artextes Editions, which today comprises about 20 titles. Artexte also set up a national service for the distribution of exhibition catalogues and independent publications on contemporary art. In 1997, this service was transferred to a private business specializing in the distribution of this type of document, ABC Art Books Canada.
In 1993, the bookstore moved into the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal]]. Two years later Artexte let go of its bookstore operations, which were passed on to Librairie Olivieri in September 1995, under a partnership agreement respecting the initial objectives of Artexte's mandate. The Librairie Olivieri du Musée closed its doors in 2009.

In May 1996, Artexte moved to a larger space at 460 Sainte-Catherine Street West. This move marked the beginning of a new era for the organization and its users, by positioning Artexte within the heart of a network frequented by artists and researchers of contemporary art.

In 2012, Artexte moved to new premises in Montreal's vibrant ''Quartier des spectacles''. Artexte now occupies a large, luminous space on the third floor of the 2-22 Building (at 2 Sainte-Catherine Street East). In addition to having a larger consultation area for research purposes than before, it opened a new exhibition space. The gallery's programming is linked to print culture and addresses issues pertaining to visual arts documents.

Artexte has become a renowned arts organization which, by the scope of its activities, responds with a high level of professionalism to the specific needs of the visual arts network in Canada and beyond.

[[File:YEAROFTHEDRAGONSF1979.jpg|thumb|Playwright Frank Chin portrays "Fred Eng" in the Asian American Theater Workshop production of ''Year of the Dragon'' in San Francisco, California 1977]]
The '''Asian American Theater Company''' (AATC) is a non-profit theatre performance company based in San Francisco. Its stated mission is "To connect people to Asian American culture through theatre".

==Background==
The Asian American Theater Company was established in 1973 by playwright [[Frank Chin]] to develop and present original works of [[Asian American theatre|theatre about Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent]]. AATC is credited as a progenitor of the Asian-American theater movement alongside [[East West Players]] and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Velina Hasu. "Currents: Out of the Margins: A National Theatre Conference in Los Angeles Galvanizes Asian-American Forces." ''American Theatre'' 10 2006: 132–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a producing company, AATC is a workshop where [[Asian people|Asian]] [[Pacific Islander]] writers, actors and directors can explore ideas and create works that carry with them the AATC's purpose, which is to explore who [[Asian American|Asian Pacific Islander Americans]] are as a people and as a community.

For many years the Asian American Theater Company was housed in The Asian American Theater Center located near the corner of Arguello and Clement Streets in San Francisco’s ethnically diverse Richmond district. The Theater Center suffered much damage from the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], but was able to re-open its doors a year later. The costly repairs however created a heavy economic burden and in 1996 the Asian American Theater Company moved its administrative offices to Japantown, and produced its plays in various theater venues throughout the city such as the Off-Market Theater and the Thick House. Today the administrative offices reside in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood at 1695 18th Street.

==Programs==

The company's main stage productions are new plays and revivals of classics by Asian Pacific Islander American playwrights, directed, performed and designed by local talent.  Most scripts will have been developed at AATC and each will be presented at various venues around the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] with full-production run.

Under its emerging artists project, young actors, many  of whom are making their acting debut, perform plays by new playwrights or revivals of classics by established artists.  Many of the actors and writers taking part in the Emerging Artists Project have participated in the Training Program.

The group hosts staged readings, where scripts under development are directed, rehearsed and presented, followed by discussion and critique.  Readings are free or a nominal donation is requested.  Scripts from women and under-represented Asian Pacific Islander groups are especially welcome.

A training program consisting of two semesters a year of courses in acting, scene study, voice and movement and playwright's workshops, conducted by professional artists, offered at low cost.

==Alumni==
Many well known Asian American actors and playwrights have been associated with AATC productions in the past.  Notable alumni:

===Actors===
* [[Michael Paul Chan]]

Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-36815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asimakopulos was born in Montreal in 1930.  He was educated at [[McGill University]] earning a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1953. In September 1953 Tom went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; his research topic was a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled ''Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade''.&lt;ref name=TERMS&gt;Asimakopulos, A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661902 ''A Note on Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade'']. Oxford Economic Papers, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1957), pp. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; With his classmate [[Keith Frearson]], the Australian economist, Tom went to [[Joan Robinson|Joan Robinson's]] lectures on what would become ''The Accumulation of Capital''&lt;ref name=ACCUMCAP&gt;Robinson, Joan. [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-accumulation-of-capital-by-joan-robinson.jsp ''The Accumulation of Capital'']. London: Macmillan Company, 1965. First published 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; – Robinson's ''magnum opus'', which sought to extend [[Keynesian economics|Keynes's theory]] to account for long-run issues of growth and [[capital accumulation]]. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms  of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical methodology]] on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by [[Piero Sraffa]], [[Robin Marris]], and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].

Asimakopulos was a Lecturer in Economics and Political Science from 1956 to 1957 at McGill. From 1957 to 1959 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the Royal Military College. In 1959 he returned to McGill and became an assistant professor, working close to [[J.C. Weldon]]. Promoted to the position of associate professor in 1963, he became a full professor in 1966. In 1988 he was appointed ''"William Dow Professor of Political Economy"'' on Weldon's vacancy. He served as Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1974 to 1978. Teaching was his top priority; Asimakopulos loved teaching the microeconomics course to the Honours Students at McGill. Even though he had an assistant, Asimakopulos made sure that, from time to time, he gave tutorials himself, on which he would emphasize, ''ad nauseam'' the importance of the ''assumptions'' of the analysis and its implications on the results of the theoretical model studied.  He wrote extensively on the work of such economic theorists as J. M. Keynes, Joan Robinson, and [[Michał Kalecki]]. He was active in many professional associations and organizations. He held numerous fellowships and was a Visiting Professor and a Fellow at universities in the United States, England and Australia. From 1976 to 1990 he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Athanasios Asimakopulos died of leukemia in 1990.&lt;ref name=harcourt/&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Asimakopulos was a [[Post Keynesian]] / "[[Michał Kalecki|Kaleckian]]" scholar, who elaborated upon Michał Kalecki's theories.&lt;ref name=KALECIANMODEL&gt;Lavoie, Marc. [http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/6/789 ''The Kaleckian model of growth and distribution and its neo-Ricardian and neo-Marxian critiques'']. Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (6), 1993, pp. 789–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopulos wrote mainly around and on Keynesian themes and on growth, distribution and technical progress (the latter often with Weldon). Over time Kalecki's contributions came to be a major influence and interest; Tom came back to Kalecki, influenced by Joan Robinson. Kalecki stresses on determinants of income distribution, determinants of economic activity, determinants of profits, long-run growth, prospects of economy, or impact of imperfect competition on growth of income has been an important inspiration to many economists we call [[Post Keynesian]]s, including Asimakopulos.&lt;ref name= KALECKI1&gt;Nuti, D.

An advantage of theories that originate from Kalecki is that they are closer to what can be called "normal" theories. Kalecki's papers are acceptably formalized and not as extensively open to various interpretations as Keynes' ''General Theory''.&lt;ref name=KALECKINAMOD2&gt;Lavoie. Marc.

When [[Post Keynesians]] treat production side of the economy in their models, they usually inhabit their models with firms, which operate within neither perfectly competitive environment, nor within perfect monopoly setting. Post Keynesian firms usually set their prices as mark-ups above their prime costs. Profits of those firms usually, along with ''"animal spirits and expectations"'', have pronounced impact on investment decisions and therefore determine profits in the future. This double-sided relationship between profits and investment is clearly in spirit of Asimakopulos (1971)&lt;ref name=DETKEY&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/00084239.html Asimakopulos, Athanasios. ''The Determination of Investment in Keynes's Model'', Canadian JE, 1971, vol. 4, issue 3, pp. 382–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The most succinct definition of post-Keynesian economics comes from Joan Robinson:

::To me, the expression '''''post-Keynesian''''' has a definite meaning; it applies to an economic theory or method of analysis which takes account of the difference between the future and the past. {{small|(emphasis in the original)}} {{small|(1978; CEP, vol. V, 1979b, 210)}}

===Post Keynesianism===
The principal concern of [[Post Keynesians]] is to have a more complex and realistic aggregate [[supply and demand]] framework that includes mark-up pricing, the trend to monopoly, the workings of [[endogenous money]] and credit, circular and cumulative causation, and a pragmatic guide to policy. The workings of uncertainty lead to an unstable capitalistic system that requires the making of agreements and accords to promote stability. At the global level, it requires a fairer distribution of power such that the onus is on nations with trade surpluses to adjust their policies. More than anything, Post Keynesians eschew the quantity theory of money, since money and credit are seen to affect output and employment in both the short and long term. Indeed, like the institutionalists and Marxists, they see the capitalist economy as a monetary system of production, where money and [[creative financing]] are essential aspects of its functioning.&lt;ref name=POSTKEY1&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/37-RA-2.pdf O'Hara, Phillip Anthony.

They all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the [[Marxist Socialism|classical Marxian tradition]], in most cases in the light of the [[Keynesians|Keynesian revolution]]. The one exception is Michał Kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream.

Asimakopulos however viewed himself as a [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream]] economist.

====Asimakopulos' critique of Keynes' ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment''====
In his ''General Theory'', John Maynard Keynes proposed an investment function of the sort &lt;  I = I0 + I(r)  &gt; where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to "rank" various investment projects depending on their ''"[[internal rate of return]]"'' (or ''"marginal efficiency of investment"'') and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal efficiency of investment was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. &lt;  MEI = r  &gt;.

Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) and several Post Keynesians offered a troublesome critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very possibility of a downward-sloping ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)'' function in the presence of unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal efficiency of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase  which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the ''MEI'' curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.&lt;ref name=KEYNESIRR&gt;Asimakopulos et al., [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm ''J. M. Keynes's Internal Rate of Return''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418015246/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}, at HET website.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, it is easy to conceive that, in situations of unemployment where the multiplier works its magic, investment is actually indeterminate&amp;nbsp;– or rather, an ever-shifting ''MEI'' curve could imply that all investment projects will be eventually undertaken and not merely those that are profitable at the given rate of interest since the profitability of projects is itself a function of aggregate demand and thus endogenous to the problem.

==Quotes on Asimakopulos==
::Tom Asimakopulos was a great Kaleckian scholar. His knowledge of the nuances and innuendos of Kalecki's approach to macroeconomics had no equal. {{small|Paul Davidson, Journal of Economic Issues.}}

::This book (''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'') is the legacy of a dedicated and tough-minded scholar who did his heroes the compliment of taking their work seriously, rather than just praising it. {{small|Robert W. Dimand, History of Political Economy.}}

The amount of coverage in published written works about Trump over time is due to his fame prior to his 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; Biographer [[Michael D'Antonio]] observed in ''[[Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success]]'' (2015) that Trump "has been a topic of conversation in America for almost 40 years. No one in the world of business&amp;nbsp;– not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett&amp;nbsp;– has been as famous as Trump for as long."&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; Almost one year after his inauguration as president, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that more than 4,500 English-language books about Trump had been published since he took office, compared to just over 800 works about predecessor [[Barack Obama]] during his first year in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madigan|first1=Andrew|title=After the Fire and Fury: what's next for books about Trump?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/17/books-about-trump-fire-and-fury|work=The Guardian|date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sheer volume of books about Trump, the titles listed here are limited to non-fiction books about Trump or his presidency, published by notable authors and scholars. Tertiary sources (including textbooks and juvenile literature), satire, and self-published books are excluded.

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. (in press). Psychological Bricolage and the Creative Process. In C. Shalley, M. Hitt, and J. Zhou (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOEwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=oxford+creativity+bricolage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YO2B5AYJD&amp;sig=fUzbuH-bEH_OB4D3iaqMu-DbRjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3MgVbe9KcjosAXC1oGABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20creativity%20bricolage&amp;f=false] of the [[University of Michigan]], draws from two separate disciplines.  The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">The '''Contemporary Art Research Centre''' is a Research Centre within the Department of Fine Art, Kingston University, England. The founding Directors are Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, and the Director from 2016 is Mandy Ure . The stated ethos of the centre specifically refers to the research of [[André Breton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[We aim] to build and provide an intellectual and creative milieu for innovation in contemporary fine art. Taking its identity from André Breton's articulation of the imagination it [The Centre] draws on the legacy of surrealism to imagine and enact possibilities of contemporary art in contingency with social politics, technology, models of knowledge and modes of experience. In the essay ''Once Upon a Time'' [Il était une fois] Breton argues for the transformative power of the imagination, that it may be applied instrumentally to change circumstances yet is also excessive to utility, absurd and radically profane. The Centre aims to house this rich range of useful/less imaginative invention. Conceits of newness do not distract us, but resourceful adaptations, hybrids, mutations, and détournement, as well as attention to the realm of the overlooked, the scatological and absurd promise of stuff, recognised through play—these things are cultivated here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fada.kingston.ac.uk//research/car/car.php Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, CARC webpage, accessed on 16 February, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Clay Figure Zhang''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|泥|人|張}}|s={{linktext|泥|人|张}}|p=Nírén Zhāng}}) is a famous [[folk art]] in [[Tianjin]], China. It was created by '''Zhang Mingshan''' ({{zh|t=張明山}}; 1826–1906) during the [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang reign]] (1821–50) of the [[Qing dynasty]].

==Production Procedure==
Clay Figure Zhang is made of ripe [[clay]] which is pure puddle with little sand through the process of weathering, slurrying, filtrating, evaporating and adding cotton to rub up. It has the characteristics of viscosity. The side materials include wood, vine, lead, paper, flowers and so on. After completely drying, the clay figure is put into stove for firing. The temperature is up to 700 degree Celsius or so. After coming out of stove, the clay figure is polished and painted. It takes about 30 days or so to finish a piece of work.

==Artistic Attractiveness==
The images of Clay Figure Zhang vary from palace maids in costume, historic figures, religious figures, and modern figures to local customs. It is usually displayed indoor, on the shelf for example, because of its small size (usually 20&amp;nbsp;cm high). Therefore, it is also called shelf sculpture. Clay Figure Zhang has vivid realistic characteristics, and can portray the figures' personality and posture, pursue dissection structure, reasonable exaggeration, suitable acceptance and rejection, special applying to give attention to both shape and spirit and have great originality.

==Modern Development==
The Clay Figure Zhang Workshop, established in 1958, is engaged in the research of painted sculpture. It has 46 staff members, 5 creation rooms and 3 shops. Many of its art works have been awarded and are collected by domestic and abroad Art Gallery. In 2006, Clay Figure Zhang was listed as first grade national legacy of China.

[[File:Friedrich-Johann-Justin-Bertuch Mythical-Creature-Dragon 1806.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of a winged, fire-breathing dragon by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch]] from 1806]]
[[File:Ninedragonwallpic1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Carved imperial Chinese dragons at [[Nine-Dragon Wall]], [[Beihai Park]], [[Beijing]] ]]
A '''dragon''' is a large, [[snake|serpent]]-like [[legendary creature]] that appears in the [[folklore]] of many cultures around the world. Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.

The earliest attested dragons resemble giant snakes. Dragon-like creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical dragons include the ''[[mušḫuššu]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]], [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Vritra|Vṛtra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]], [[Jörmungandr]], [[Níðhöggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]], and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.

The popular western image of a dragon as winged, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire is an invention of the [[High Middle Ages]] based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].

The word "dragon" has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (龍, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&amp;pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T. Arnold], 1876, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''dragon'' entered the [[English language]] in the early 13th century from [[Old French]] ''dragon'', which in turn comes from {{lang-la|draconem}} (nominative ''draco'') meaning "huge serpent, dragon", from {{lang-el|δράκων}}, ''drakon'' (genitive ''drakontos'', δράκοντος) "serpent, giant seafish".{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=4}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddra%2Fkwn2 Δράκων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|pages=2–4}}

==Sources of inspiration for dragon myths==
[[File:Bone of Wawel Dragon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Several bones purported to belong to the [[Wawel Dragon]] hang outside of [[Wawel Cathedral]], but actually belong to a [[pleistocene]] mammal.]]

Dragon-like creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates from{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}} and a wide variety of theories have been proposed.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}} In his book ''[[An Instinct for Dragons]]'' (2000), [[anthropologist]] [[David E. Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 390 people in a thousand are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166–168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in "dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}

In her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times'' (2000), [[Adrienne Mayor]] argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii–xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by "observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as "dragon bones"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long "been considered barren of large fossils."{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that "Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as [[Komodo dragon]]s, [[Gila monster]]s, [[iguana]]s, [[alligator]]s, or, in California, [[Elgaria|alligator lizards]]."{{sfn|Mayor|2005|page=149}}

==Middle East==
===Ancient Near East===
====Mesopotamia====
[[File:Sirrush.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The ''[[mušḫuššu]]'' is a serpentine, dragon-like monster from [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|ancient Mesopotamian mythology]] with the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}} Here it is shown as it appears in the [[Ishtar Gate]] from the city of [[Babylon]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}}]]

Ancient peoples across the [[Near East]] believed in creatures similar to what modern people call "dragons".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=71}} These ancient peoples were unaware of the existence of [[dinosaurs]] or similar creatures in the distant past.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=71}}{{efn|The Middle East was mostly underwater at the time when dinosaurs existed,{{sfn|Carrington|2014}} so dinosaur fossils are extremely rare.{{sfn|Carrington|2014}} [[Australian Age of Dinosaurs#Dr Benjamin Kear|Benjamin Kear]], a palaeontologist at [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden, states, "To say that finds [of dinosaur fossils in the Middle East] are rare is an understatement. What's been discovered, you could almost fit inside a shoebox."{{sfn|Carrington|2014}}}} References to dragons of both benevolent and malevolent characters occur throughout ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n literature.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=71}} In [[Sumerian poetry]], great kings are often compared to the ''[[Ušumgallu|ušumgal]]'', a gigantic, serpentine monster.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=71}} A dragon-like creature with the foreparts of a lion and the hind-legs, tail, and wings of a bird appears in [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian artwork]] from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Period]] ({{circa}} 2334 – 2154 BC) until the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian Period]] (626 BC–539 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}} The dragon is usually shown with its mouth open.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}} It may have been known as the ''(ūmu) nā’iru'', which means "roaring weather beast",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}} and may have been associated with the god [[Hadad|Ishkur]] (Hadad).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}} A slightly different lion-dragon with two horns and the tail of a scorpion appears in art from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 BC–609 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}} A relief probably commissioned by [[Sennacherib]] shows the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and Adad standing on its back.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=121}}

Another dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the [[Hellenistic Period]] (323 BC–31 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}} This creature, known in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as the ''[[mušḫuššu]]'', meaning "furious serpent", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}} It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god [[Ninazu]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}} but later became the attendant to the [[Hurrian religion|Hurrian]] storm-god [[Tishpak]], as well as, later, Ninazu's son [[Ningishzida]], the Babylonian [[national god]] [[Marduk]], the scribal god [[Nabu]], and the Assyrian national god Ashur.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=166}}

Scholars disagree regarding the appearance of [[Tiamat]], the Babylonian goddess personifying primeval chaos slain by Marduk in the Babylonian creation epic ''[[Enûma Eliš]]''.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=177}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=153}} She was traditionally regarded by scholars as having had the form of a giant serpent,{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=153}} but several scholars have pointed out that this shape "cannot be imputed to Tiamat with certainty"{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=153}} and she seems at have at least sometimes been regarded as anthropomorphic.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=177}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=153}} Nonetheless, in some texts, she seems to be described with horns, a tail, and a hide that no weapon can penetrate,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=177}} all features which suggest she was conceived as some form of dragoness.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=177}}

In [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Apep]] is a giant serpent who resides in the [[Duat]], the Egyptian Underworld.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=11}}{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written in around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the setting of the sun is caused by [[Ra]] descending to the Duat to battle Apep.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=11}}{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} In some accounts, Apep is as long as the height of eight men with a head made of [[flint]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep's roar{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} and [[solar eclipse]]s were thought to be the result of Apep attacking Ra during the daytime.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} In some myths, Apep is slain by the god [[Set (deity)|Set]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=35–36}} [[Nehebkau]] is another giant serpent who guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the [[Pyramid Texts]] whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=36–37}} He was ultimately defeated by the [[Pharaoh]], victory which affirmed the Pharaoh's divine right to rule.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=37}}

The [[ouroboros]] was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The precursor to the ouroboros was the "Many-Faced",{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} a serpent with five heads, who, according to the [[Amduat]], the oldest surviving [[Book of the Dead|Book of the Afterlife]], was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The earliest surviving depiction of a "true" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in [[KV62|the tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]].{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christians{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} and chapter 136 of the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', an early Gnostic text, describes "a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth".{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century [[Codex Marcianus CCXXVIII (406)|Codex Marcianus]] was copied in numerous works on alchemy.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}}

The modern, western image of a dragon developed in [[western Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern European dragons preserved in the Bible, and western European folk traditions.{{sfn|Fee|2011|page=7}} The period between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries represents the height of European interest in dragons as living creatures.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=101}} The twelfth-century [[Wales|Welsh]] monk [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] recounts a famous legend in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' in which the child prophet [[Merlin]] witnesses the Romano-Celtic warlord [[Vortigern]] attempt to build a tower on [[Snowdon|Mount Snowdon]] to keep safe from the [[Anglo-Saxons]],{{sfn|Hughes|2005|page=106}} but the tower keeps being swallowed into the ground.{{sfn|Hughes|2005|page=106}} Merlin informs Vortigern that, underneath the foundation he has built, is a pool with two dragons sleeping in it.{{sfn|Hughes|2005|page=106}} Vortigern orders for the pool to be drained, exposing a [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and a [[white dragon]], who immediately begin fighting.{{sfn|Hughes|2005|page=106}} Merlin delivers a prophecy that the white dragon will triumph over the red, symbolizing England's conquest of Wales,{{sfn|Hughes|2005|page=106}} but declares that the red dragon will eventually return and defeat the white one.{{sfn|Hughes|2005|pages=106–107}} This story remained popular throughout the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Hughes|2005|pages=106–107}}

The legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] may be referenced as early as the sixth century AD,{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=53}}{{sfn|Thurston|1909|pages=453–455}} but the earliest artistic representations of it come from the eleventh century{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=53}} and the first full account of it comes from an eleventh century [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] text.{{sfn|Walter|2003|page=141}} The most famous version of the story from the ''Golden Legend'' holds that a dragon kept pillaging the sheep of the town of Silene in [[Ancient Libya|Libya]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=53}} After it ate a young shepherd, the people were forced to placate it by leaving two sheep as sacrificial offerings every morning beside the lake where the dragon lived.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=53}} Eventually, the dragon ate all of the sheep{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=54}} and the people were forced to start offering it their own children.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=54}} One day, the king's own daughter came up in the lottery and, despite the king's pleas for her life, she was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock beside the lake to be eaten.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=54}} Then, Saint George arrived and saw the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=54}} When the dragon arrived to eat her, he stabbed it with his lance and subdued it by making the sign of the cross and tying the princess's [[girdle]] around its neck.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=54}} Saint George and the princess led the now-docile dragon into the town and George promised to kill it if the townspeople would convert to Christianity.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=55}} All the townspeople converted and Saint George killed the dragon with his sword.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=55}} In some versions, Saint George marries the princess,{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=55}} but, in others, he continues wandering.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=55}}

Dragons are prominent in medieval [[heraldry]].{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} [[Uther Pendragon]] was famously said have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal [[coat of arms]].{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=28}} Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs,{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a "dragon" (which could only have exactly four legs) and a "[[wyvern]]" (which could only have exactly two).{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence,{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} but, in heraldry, they are used as symbols for overthrowing the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a dragon-like creature known as a "[[cockatrice]]".{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice's mortal enemy.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} A [[basilisk]] is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a [[midden]] by a nine-year-old cockatrice.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}}

{{main|Slavic dragon}}
In [[Slavic mythology]], the words ''"zmey"'', ''"zmiy"'' or ''"zmaj"'' are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for "snake", which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''смок'', ''цмок'', or ''smok''. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called ''lamya'' (ламя, ламjа, lamja). Although quite similar to other [[European dragon]]s, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.

In [[Folklore of Russia|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian folklore]], [[Zmey Gorynych]] is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goat-like horns.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of [[sulfur]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} It was believed that [[eclipse]]s were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the [[tsar]] and imprisoned her in his castle in the [[Ural Mountains]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Then a palace guard in [[Moscow]] named [[Ivan Tsarevich]] overheard two crows talking about the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=147–148}} He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}}

A popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the [[Wawel Dragon]],{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} which is first recorded in the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Chronica Polonorum]]'' of [[Wincenty Kadłubek]], written between 1190 and 1208.{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} According to Kadłubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of [[Krakus|King Krakus]]{{sfn|Dębicka}} and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week.{{sfn|Dębicka}} If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Since they could not slay it by hand,{{sfn|Dębicka}} they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself,{{sfn|Dębicka}} telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}} The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished.{{sfn|Dębicka}} In the fifteenth century, [[Jan Długosz]] rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon.{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} Another version of the story told by [[Marcin Bielski]] instead has the clever shoemaker Skubę come up with the idea for slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Rożek|1988|page=27}} Bielski's version is now the most popular.{{sfn|Dębicka}}

The [[Chinese dragon]] ({{zh|t=龍|s=龙|p=lóng}}) is the highest-ranking animal in the Chinese animal hierarchy. Its origins are vague, but its "ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels."&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Patricia Bjaaland. ''Chinese Art: A Guide to Motifs and Visual Imagery'', Tuttle Publishing, 2008, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; A number of popular stories deal with the rearing of dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', which was probably written during the [[Warring States period]], describes a man named Dongfu, a descendant of Yangshu'an, who loved dragons{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} and, because he could understand a dragon's will, he was able to tame them and raise them well.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} He served Emperor Shun, who gave him the family name Huanlong, meaning "Dragon-Raiser".{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} In another story, [[Kongjia]], the fourteenth emperor of the [[Xia dynasty]], was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} but could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liulei, who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liulei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} who loved it so much that he demanded Liulei to serve him the same meal again.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} Since Liulei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}}

One of the most famous dragon stories is about the Lord Ye Gao, who loved dragons obsessively, even though he had never seen one.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} He decorated his whole house with dragon motifs{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} and, seeing this display of admiration, a real dragon came and visited Ye Gao,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} but the lord was so terrified at the sight of the creature that he ran away.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} In Chinese legend, the culture hero [[Fu Hsi]] is said to have been crossing the [[Luo River (Henan)|Lo River]], when he saw the ''[[Longma|lung ma]]'', a Chinese horse-dragon with seven dots on its face, six on its back, eight on its left flank, and nine on its right flank.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} He was so moved by this apparition that, when he arrived home, he drew a picture of it, including the dots.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} He later used these dots as letters and invented [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], which he used to write his book ''[[I Ching]]''.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} In another Chinese legend, the physician Ma Shih Huang is said to have healed a sick dragon.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Another legend reports that a man once came to the healer Lo Chên-jen, telling him that he was a dragon and that he needed to be healed.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} After Lo Chên-jen healed the man, a dragon appeared to him and carried him to heaven.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}}

In the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shanhaijing]]'', a classic mythography probably compiled mostly during the [[Han dynasty]], various deities and demigods are associated with dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=103–104}} One of the most famous Chinese dragons is Ying Long ("Responding Dragon"), who helped the [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], the Yellow Emperor, defeat the tyrant [[Chiyou]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The dragon [[Zhulong (mythology)|Zhulong]] ("Torch Dragon") is a god "who composed the universe with his body."{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} In the ''Shanhaijing'', many mythic heroes are said to have been conceived after their mothers copulated with divine dragons, including Huangdi, [[Shennong]], [[Emperor Yao]], and [[Emperor Shun]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The god [[Zhurong]] and the emperor [[Qi of Xia|Qi]] are both described as being carried by two dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=104–105}} as are Huangdi, [[Zhuanxu]], [[Yuqiang]], and Roshou in various other texts.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} According to the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', an evil black dragon once caused a destructive deluge,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} which was ended by the mother goddess [[Nüwa]] by slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}}

A large number of ethnic myths about dragons are told throughout China.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The ''[[Houhanshu]]'', compiled in the fifth century BC by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]], reports a story belonging to the Ailaoyi people, which holds that a woman named Shayi who lived in the region around [[Mount Lao]] became pregnant with ten sons after being touched by a tree trunk floating in the water while fishing.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} She gave birth to the sons and the tree trunk turned into a dragon, who asked to see his sons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The woman showed them to him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} but all of them ran away except for the youngest, who the dragon licked on the back and named Jiu Long, meaning "Sitting Back".{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The sons later elected him king and the descendants of the ten sons became the Ailaoyi people, who [[tattoo]]ed dragons on their backs in honor of their ancestor.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The [[Miao people]] of southwest China have a story that a divine dragon created the first humans by breathing on monkeys that came to play in his cave.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The [[Han Chinese|Han people]] have many stories about Short-Tailed Old Li, a black dragon who was born to a poor family in [[Shandong]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} When his mother saw him for the first time, she fainted{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} and, when his father came home from the field and saw him, he hit him with a spade and cut off part of his tail.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} Li burst through the ceiling and flew away to the [[Amur River|Black Dragon River]] in northeast China, where he became the god of that river.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=106–107}} On the anniversary of his mother's death on the Chinese lunar calendar, Old Li returns home, causing it to rain.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=107}} He is still worshipped as a rain god.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=107}}

[[File:Dragon Gods.svg|thumb|left|Diagram illustrating the four great Dragon Kings of the [[Four Seas]]]]

In China, dragons are closely associated with rain{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=107–108}} and [[drought]] is thought to be caused by a dragon's laziness.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} Prayers invoking dragons to bring rain are common in Chinese texts.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=107–108}} The ''[[Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', attributed to the Han dynasty scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]], proscribes making clay figurines of dragons during a time of drought and having young men and boys pace and dance among the figurines in order to encourage the dragons to bring rain.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=107–108}} Texts from the [[Qing dynasty]] advise hurling the bone of a tiger or dirty objects into the pool where the dragon lives;{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} since dragons cannot stand tigers or dirt, the dragon of the pool will cause heavy rain to drive the object out.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} Rainmaking rituals invoking dragons are still very common in many Chinese villages, where each village has its own god said to bring rain and many of these gods are dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} Although stories of the [[Dragon King]]s are among the most popular dragon stories in China today, these stories did not begin to emerge until the [[Eastern Han]], when Buddhist stories of the serpent rain-god [[Nāga]] became popular.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} [[Taoism|Taoists]] began to invent their own dragon kings and eventually such stories developed in every major Chinese religion.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} According to these stories, every body of water is ruled by dragon king, each with a different power, rank, and ability,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} so people began establishing temples across the countryside dedicated to these figures.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}}

Many traditional Chinese customs revolve around dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=108–109}} During various holidays, including the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]] and [[Lantern Festival]], villagers will construct an approximately sixteen-foot-long dragon from grass, cloth, bamboo strips, and paper, which they will parade through the city as part of a [[dragon dance]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but now it is done mostly only for entertainment.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} During the [[Dragon Boat Festival|Duanwu]] festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a [[Dragon boat|dragon boat race]], in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet [[Qu Yuan]] committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]] and people raced out in boats hoping to save him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] gradually became closely identified with dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnation of a divine dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon were ordered to be executed.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} After the last Chinese emperor was overthrown in 1911, this situation changed and now many ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descendants of dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=109–110}}

Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India. Like these other Asian dragons, most Japanese ones are [[water deities]] associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet. Gould writes (1896:248),&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gould (geologist)|Gould, Charles]]. 1896. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YKEAAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mythical+monsters&amp;pgis=1 Mythical Monsters"]. W. H. Allen &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese dragon is "invariably figured as possessing three claws". A story about the ''[[samurai]]'' [[Minamoto no Mitsunaka]] tells that, while he was hunting in his own territory of [[Settsu Province|Settsu]], he fell asleep under a tree and had a dream in which a beautiful woman appeared to him and begged him to save her land from a giant serpent which was defiling it.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Mitsunaka agreed to help and the maiden gave him a magnificent horse.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} When he woke up, the horse was standing before him.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} He rode it to the [[Sumiyoshi taisha|Sumiyoshi]] temple, where he prayed for eight days.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Then he confronted the serpent and slew it with an arrow.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}}

It was believed that dragons could be appeased or [[exorcism|exorcised]] with metal.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} [[Nitta Yoshisada]] is said to have hurled a famous sword into the sea at [[Sagami Province|Sagami]] to appease the dragon-god of the sea{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} and [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] threw a metal mirror into the sea at Sumiyoshi for the same purpose.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Japanese Buddhism has also adapted dragons by subjecting them to [[Buddhist law]];{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} the Japanese Buddhist deities [[Benten]] and [[Kwannon]] are often shown sitting or standing on the back of a dragon.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Several Japanese ''[[sennin]]'' ("immortals") have taken dragons as their mounts.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} [[Bômô]] is said to have hurled his staff into a puddle of water, causing a dragon to come forth and let him ride it to heaven.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[Arhat|rakan]]'' Handaka is said to have been able to conjure a dragon out of a bowl, which he is often shown playing with on ''kagamibuta''.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[shachihoko]]'' is a creature with the head of a dragon, a bushy tail, fish-like scales, and sometimes fire emerging from its armpits.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[shifun]]'' has the head of a dragon, feathered wings, and the tail and claws of a bird.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} A white dragon was believed to reside in a pool in [[Yamashiro Province]]{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} and, every fifty years, it would turn into a bird called the Ogonchô, which had a call like the "howling of a wild dog".{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} This event was believed to herald terrible famine.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} In the Japanese village of Okumura, near [[Edo]], during times of drought, the villagers would make a dragon effigy out of straw, [[magnolia]] leaves, and [[bamboo]] and parade it through the village to attract rainfall.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}}

==Modern depictions==
[[File:Smaug par David Demaret.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern [[Fan art|fan illustration]] by David Demaret of the dragon [[Smaug]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1937 [[high fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'']]

Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the [[fantasy]] genre.{{sfn|Malone|2012|pages=96–98}}{{sfn|Williamson|2015|page=28}} As early as the eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] were already asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons: "There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Dragons|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.976|website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s classic [[Children's literature|children's novel]] ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1872), one of the inset poems describes the [[Jabberwocky]], a kind of dragon.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Carroll's illustrator [[John Tenniel]], a famous [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoonist]], humorously showed the Jobberwocky with the [[waistcoat]], [[Malocclusion|buck teeth]], and [[Near-sightedness|myopic eyes]] of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] university lecturer, such as Carroll himself.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} In works of comedic children's fantasy, dragons often fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} In such works, rather than being frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless, benevolent, and inferior to humans.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} They are sometimes shown living in contact with humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} Though popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, "such comic and idyllic stories" began to grow increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children's literature.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}}

One of the most iconic modern dragons is [[Smaug]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s classic novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''.{{sfn|Malone|2012|pages=96–98}} Dragons also appear in the bestselling ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of children's novels by [[J. K. Rowling]].{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Other prominent works depicting dragons include [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'', [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea Cycle]]'', [[George R. R. Martin]]'s series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', and [[Christopher Paolini]]'s ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]''. Sandra Martina Schwab writes, "With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles. In children's literature the friendly dragon becomes a powerful ally in battling the child's fears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Schwab, Sandra Martina |chapter= Dragons |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 216 |isbn= 0-313-32951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular [[role playing game]] system ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (D&amp;D) makes heavy use of [[Dragons (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]].{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}}

The '''English Folk Dance and Song Society''' ('''EFDSS''', or pronounced 'EFF-diss'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVTMoN4Arvo Challenges of Designing the Roud Folk Song Index], Library of Congress, YouTube, 9:00&lt;/ref&gt;) was formed in 1932 when two organisations merged: the Folk-Song Society and the English Folk Dance Society.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Karpeles, Maud]] and Frogley, Alain (2007–2011).

Retrieved 24 October 2011. {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFDSS, a member-based organisation, was incorporated as a [[company]] limited by guarantee (no. 297142) in 1935 and became a [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] (no. 305999) in England and Wales in 1963.

The English Folk Dance Society was founded in 1911 by [[Cecil Sharp]]. [[Maud Karpeles]] was a leading participant.  Its purpose was to preserve and promote [[English country dances|English folk dances]] in their traditional forms, including [[Morris dance|Morris]] and [[sword dances]], traditional [[social dances]], and interpretations of the dances published by [[John Playford]].

One of the greatest contributions that the EFDSS made to the folk movement, both dance and song, was the folk festival, starting with the [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] Festival in the 1940s and later festivals in [[Whitby]], [[Sidmouth Festival|Sidmouth]], [[Holmfirth]], [[Chippenham]] and elsewhere.

==Publications==
Since 1936 the EFDSS has published ''English Dance &amp; Song'' at least four times a year. This has become the longest-established magazine devoted to folk music, dance and song in the country. ''English Dance &amp; Song'' is aimed at stimulating the interest of the membership of the EFDSS, as well as the wider folk music and dance community.

Their regular scholarly publication is ''Folk Music Journal'', published annually in December, which was formerly entitled the ''Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society'' until 1965. The work continues the earlier journals of the two societies: ''Journal of the Folk-Song Society'', 1899–1931;&lt;ref&gt;Dean-Smith, Margaret (1951). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4521357 'The Preservation of English Folk Song in the Journal of the Folk Song Society']. ''Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society'', vol 6, no 3 (December), pp 69–76. Retrieved 24 October 2011 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Journal of the English Folk Dance Society 191431''.

==Recent developments==
[[Image:Cecil Sharp House-1.jpg|thumb|Cecil Sharp House in Regent's Park, London, is home to the English Folk Dance and Song Society]]

In 1998, with the folk movement strongly supported by a number of other organisations and the seeds planted by EFDSS thriving, the EFDSS altered its strategy to focus on education and archiving, with its primary goal the development of the [[Vaughan Williams Memorial Library]] as the country's national archive and resource centre for folk music, dance and song. 

In 2011 the society entered into a joint commission with [[Shrewsbury Folk Festival]] to create the [[Cecil Sharp Project]], a multi-artist residential commission to create new works based on the life and collecting of [[Cecil Sharp]].  The project took place in March 2011, the artists involved being: [[Steve Knightley]], [[Andy Cutting]], [[Leonard Podolak]], [[Jim Moray]], [[Jackie Oates]], [[Caroline Herring]], [[Kathryn Roberts]] and Patsy Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cecil Sharp Project |url=https://www.efdss.org/efdss-artists-development/commissions/cecil-sharp-project |website=English Folk Dance and Song Society |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, EFDSS launched [[The Full English (folk music archive)|The Full English]], an ongoing archive project supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[The Folklore Society]], the National Folk Music Fund and the English Miscellany Folk Dance Group. This free and searchable resource of 44,000 records and over 58,000 digitised images is the world's biggest digital archive of traditional music and dance tunes.&lt;ref name="archive launch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title='Staggering' digital folk music archive launched|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10134011/Staggering-digital-folk-music-archive-launched.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as folk music, the EFDSS is home to a number of performance artists, providing a regular performance platform for acts including the [[Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain]], the [[Massive Violins]] and the [[The Swingle Singers|Swingle Singers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">The  '''Fryderyk Chopin Institute''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: '''Narodowy Instytut Fryderyka Chopina''') was created in 2001 as the result of legislation in the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/institute/organization/legal_act "Legal Act" (English translation)], Fryderyk Chopin Institute website, accessed 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is located in [[Warsaw]]. It is dedicated to researching and promoting the life and works of [[Poles|Polish]] composer [[Frédéric Chopin]], (born in Poland as Fryderyk Chopin). Its activities include publications, organization of concerts,  conserving the physical and artistic Chopin heritage, monitoring the commercial use of Chopin's name and operating a Chopin Information Centre (the Institute's website).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/institute/organization/about "About us"], Fryderyk Chopin Institute website, accessed 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst its publication projects is a complete [[facsimile]] edition of Chopin's works, compiled from all available [[holograph]] manuscripts, edited by Zofia Chechlińska.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Mądry, [http://polishlibraries.pl/article.php?a=9 "19th Century editions of the Works of Chopin as an Aspect of the History of Reception"], Polish Libraries website, accessed 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the organizer of the five-yearly [[International Chopin Piano Competition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://konkurs.chopin.pl/en Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403212032/http://konkurs.chopin.pl/en |date=2015-04-03 }} of the International Chopin Competition, accessed 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs the "Young Talents" programme to encourage young Polish pianists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/institute/promotion/talents "Promotion of Young Talents"], Fryderyk Chopin Institute website, accessed 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is also organizing a festival ''Chopin and his Europe'' since 2005. It presents European music in the context of its links with the life and work of Chopin. One of the objectives of the festival programme is historical performance - presenting works as they were originally heard, on period instruments. The festival is organised in collaboration with the Warsaw Philharmonic, Teatr Wielki - Polish National Opera and Polish Radio II.

They are two very different men and the best of friends, and now work together as private investigators for Hap's girlfriend Brett Sawyer. Together they always wind up in a lot of trouble with various criminal types in the fictional town of LaBorde, in [[East Texas]] and often find themselves attempting to solve various unpleasant and brutal crimes. Both men are well versed in the [[martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/hap.html|title=Hap Collins &amp; Leonard Pine|last=Smith|first=Kevin Burton|date=2017|website=www.thrillingdetective.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822102400/http://www.thrillingdetective.com/hap.html|archive-date=2016-08-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/series/50105-hap-collins-and-leonard-pine|title=Hap and Leonard series by Joe R.

==Hap Collins==
Hap Collins is a white working class laborer who spent time in federal prison as a young man for refusing to be drafted into the military and serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. In his late forties, he is often haunted by the various unpleasant jobs he's held over the years such as working at an aluminum chair factory and working the East Texas rose fields. Hap tries his best to avoid violence and also tries his best to avoid the taking of another human life. Often lovesick, most of his relationships haven't worked out. He is currently with his on-again-off-again girlfriend Brett Sawyer. Some of his past has been taken from Mr. Lansdale's own past. The stories are told from Hap's narrative point of view. Not as quick to anger as Leonard, he often finds himself attempting to talk Leonard out of committing serious violence.

==Leonard Pine==
Leonard Pine is a gay, black [[Vietnam vet]] with serious anger issues. He was raised by his uncle who shunned him after learning he was gay. However, when his uncle passes away, he leaves his house and all his assets to Leonard. Leonard has zero tolerance for racist or [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] slurs. Although Hap dislikes guns, Leonard has no problem carrying or using them. Quick to anger, at times he cannot understand Hap's aversion to violence or killing if necessary, even when provoked. His relationships are also short and tempestuous. Leonard is the much more aggressive of the two and repeatedly burned down a local [[crack house]] that used to be his new next door neighbor. After living with Hap and Brett for a while, he recently moved into his own place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-shaw/the-descendants-of-holmes_b_5499245.html|title=The Descendants of Holmes and Watson: 11 Literary Partners-in-Crime|first=Johnny|date=|website=|publisher=Huffington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827203634/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-shaw/the-descendants-of-holmes_b_5499245.html|archive-date=2015-08-27|dead-url=no|last1=Shaw|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much to Hap's dismay, Leonard has a habit of wearing ugly hats.

==Career==

While studying in [[Lalton]] village high school, his [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] teacher, [[Hari Singh Dilbar]], a well known Punjabi writer and novelist, encouraged him to write some poetic&lt;ref name="ikm1"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1AOsik6gp8 | title=dev thrike wala in ik khas mulakat zee punjabi with narinder 1 | publisher=YouTube | date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dev wrote a song for children, as he was a child himself at that time, named ''Chal Chakk Bhaine Basta School Challiye'' which was published in a magazine named ''Bal Darbar''.&lt;ref name=yt/&gt; This encouraged him a lot and he continued to writing. Later he started writing stories under the name ''Hardev Dilgir'' and till now, wrote about 35 books of stories and songs like ''Zaildarni''&lt;ref name="jk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shivcharanjaggikussa.com/2012/01/blog-post.html|title=ਗੀਤਕਾਰੀ ਦਾ ਯੁੱਗ ਅਤੇ ਦਰਵੇਸ਼ ਮੂਰਤ ਬਾਈ 'ਦੇਵ ਥਰੀਕੇ ਵਾਲਾ'|date=|publisher=ShivCharanJaggiKussa.com|author=Shivcharan Jaggi Kussa|work=An article in Punjabi language|accessdate=24 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308054727/http://www.shivcharanjaggikussa.com/2012/01/blog-post.html|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rohee Da Phull'', ''Ikk See Kurhi'' etc.&lt;ref name=ikm1/&gt; He got a job of a teacher in 1960 and his first song was recorded in 1961.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmcd6i_dev-tharikewala_people | title=Dev Tharikewala | publisher=[[Daily Motion]] | date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends encouraged him to write songs and as he was inspired by [[Inderjit Hasanpuri]]'s song ''Sadhoo Hunde Rabb Warge, Ghund Kaddh Ke Khair Na Paaiye'', he written some songs for singer 'Prem Kumar Sharma', who was selected by [[Sa Re Ga Ma|HMV]].&lt;ref name=ikm1/&gt; The singer recorded Dev's first songs including ''Bhabi Teri Dhaun De Utte Gutt Mehladi Naag Ban Kaala'' and few more.&lt;ref name=ikm1/&gt; Dev was inspired to write ''Heer'' (lyrics) by a painting of [[Heer Ranjha|Heer]] by the noted [[Sobha Singh (painter)|Sobha Singh]].&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; He continue songwriting under the name, ''Dev Tharike Wala''.

=== With Kuldeep Manak ===

He met singer [[Kuldeep Manak]] and penned many folklores for him. The first songs of Dev recorded by [[Kuldeep Manak|Manak]] included ''Jaimal Phatta'' and ''Kaulan'' (Raja Rasalu), both released on 7-inch [[Extended play|EP]], [[Punjab Dian Lok Gathawan]], by [[Sa Re Ga Ma|HMV]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Kuldip-Manak-Punjab-Diyan-Lok-Gathawan/release/3579642|title=Kuldip Manak – Punjab Diyan Lok Gathawan|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics of Dev under the genre, [[Kali (chhand)|Kali]], became so popular that people started regarding the singer, [[Kuldeep Manak]], as ''King of Kalian'' although Manak sang only 13–14 [[Kali (music)|Kalian]] in his career.&lt;ref name=jk/&gt; This was due to the record-broken popularity of one of his [[Kali (music)|kali]], ''[[Tere Tille Ton]]'' that was released on Manak's first [[LP record|LP]], [[Ik Tara]], by [[Sa Re Ga Ma|HMV]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=ehkm/&gt; Dev has penned almost every [[Punjabi Qisse|Punjabi Qissa]] (''Folk story'') even those that were not so commonly known in the society including Bego-Inder, Jani Chor, Roda-Jalali, Kehar Singh-Ram Kaur and more.&lt;ref name=ehkm/&gt;

== Films ==

He also wrote lyrics for many [[Cinema of Punjab|Punjabi films]] including [[Sassi Punnu (1983 film)|Sassi Punnu]]&lt;ref name="ngh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngh.co.in/products/1097-sassi-punnu-punjabi-lp-vinyl-records-music.aspx|title=Sassi Punnu ECLP 8929 LP Vinyl|publisher=ngh.co.in|work=Buy LP record|accessdate=16 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Kuldeep Manak sang his song, ''Ajj Dhee Ik Raje Di''.

The film "Balbeero Bhabhi" featured his song "Sucheya Ve Bhabhi Teri" and "Datta Te Bhagat Soormen."
The title track of the blockbuster hit Punjabi film "[[Putt Jattan De]]" (1981) was written by Dev Tharikewala and sung by [[Surinder Shinda]].

'''High technology''', often abbreviated to '''high tech''' (adjective forms '''high-technology''', '''high-tech''' or '''hi-tech''') is [[technology]] that is at the [[state of the art|cutting edge]]: the most advanced technology available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cortright|first1=Joseph|last2=Mayer|first2=Heike|title=High Tech Specialization: A Comparison of High Technology Centers|date=January 2001|publisher=Brookings Institution, Center on Urban &amp; Metropolitan Policy|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/specialization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of high tech is ''[[low technology]]'', referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a [[slide rule]] is a low-tech calculating device.

The phrase was used in a 1958 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story advocating "[[Nuclear power|atomic energy]]" for Europe: "... Western Europe, with its dense population and its high technology ...."&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Power for Europe", ''The New York Times'', February 4, 1958, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969: "Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio] controls a score of high technology patents in variety of fields."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1969). "Market Place: Collins Versus The Middle Man", ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1969, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form, "high tech."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Robert (1971). "Market Place: So What Made E.D.S. Plunge?", ''The New York Times'', November 11, 1971, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzichronoglou, Thomas: "Revision of the High-Technology Sector and Product Classification", OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, No. 1997/02, OECD Publishing, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD coutries, resulting in four distinct categories.

The '''Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave''' is a richly-furnished [[Celt]]ic burial chamber near Hochdorf an der Enz (municipality of [[Eberdingen]]) in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], dating from 530 BC in the [[Hallstatt culture]] period.  It was discovered in 1968 by an amateur archaeologist and excavated in 1978/79. By then, the originally 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6&amp;nbsp;m) high burial mound covering the grave, which is about 200&amp;nbsp;ft (60&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter, had shrunk to about 3&amp;nbsp;ft (1&amp;nbsp;m) height and was hardly discernible due to centuries of erosion and agricultural use.

A man, roughly 40 years of age and 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in (187&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, was laid out on an exceptionally richly decorated 9&amp;nbsp;ft (275&amp;nbsp;cm) bronze recliner with eight wheels inside the burial chamber. Judging by other objects found there, this man probably had been a Celtic chieftain: He had been buried with a gold-plated [[torc]] on his neck, a bracelet on his right arm, a hat made of [[birch]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]], a gold-plated [[dagger]] made of bronze and iron, rich clothing, [[amber]] jewelry, a razor knife, a nail clipper, a comb, fishing hooks, arrows, and most notably, thin embossed gold plaques which were on his now-disintegrated shoes. At the foot of the couch was a large [[cauldron]] decorated with three lions around the brim. This cauldron was originally filled with about 100 [[gallon]]s (400 l) of [[mead]]. The east side of the tomb contained an iron-plated wooden four-wheeled wagon holding a set of bronze dishes—along with the drinking horns found on the walls enough to serve nine people.

After the examination of the grave, the burial mound has been reconstructed to its original height. Nearby a museum about this grave was built, during the construction of which the foundations of an ancient Celtic village were found, probably the one to which the chieftain belonged. These were incorporated into the museum.

{{original research|date=November 2009}}
An '''instrumental''' is a [[musical composition]] or recording without [[lyrics]], or [[singing]], although it might include some inarticulate [[vocal]]s, such as shouted [[backup vocal]]s in a [[Big Band]] setting. The word "song" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. The [[music]] is primarily or exclusively produced using [[musical instrument]]s. An instrumental can exist in [[music notation]], after it is written by a [[composer]]; in the mind of the [[composer]] (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a [[blues]] solo guitarist or a [[folk music]] [[fiddle]] player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a [[musical ensemble]], which could range in components from a [[duet|duo]] or [[trio (music)|trio]] to a large [[Big Band]], [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]].

In a [[song]] that is otherwise [[Singing|sung]], a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an '''instrumental interlude''', or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental [[introduction (music)|introduction]]. If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a "solo" (e.g., the [[guitar solo]] that is a key section of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hard rock]] songs). If the instruments are [[percussion instrument]]s, the interlude can be called a [[Break (music)|percussion interlude]] or "percussion break". These interludes are a form of [[Break (music)|break]] in the song.

Modern instrumentals are produced using a [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstation (DAW)]] such as [[FL Studio]], [[Cubase]] and [[Logic Pro]]. These pieces of software allow instrumental music to be composed with ease.

==In popular music==
In commercial [[popular music]], instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, [[remix]]es of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A [[blues]] band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include [[electric guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[upright bass]]/[[electric bass]] and [[drum kit]].

==Opposite concept==
The opposite of instrumental music, that is, music for voices alone, without any [[accompaniment]] instruments, is [[a cappella]], an Italian phrase that means "in the chapel". In [[early music]], instruments such as [[trumpet]] and [[drums]] were considered outdoor instruments, and music for inside a chapel typically used quieter instruments, voices, or just voices alone. A capella music exists in both [[Classical music]] [[choir]] pieces (for choir without any [[accompanist]] [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]]) and in popular music styles such as [[doo wop]] groups and [[Barbershop quartet]]s. For [[genre]]s in which a non-vocal song or interlude is conceived using computers and software, rather than with acoustic musical instruments or [[electronic musical instrument]]s, the term instrumental is still used for it.

==Borderline cases==
Some recordings which include brief or non-musical use of the human voice are typically considered instrumentals. Examples include songs with the following:
* Short verbal interjections (as in "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]" or "[[Topsy (instrumental)|Topsy]]" or "[[Wipe Out (instrumental)|Wipe Out]]" or "[[Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" or "[[Bentley Rhythm Ace (album)|Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out]]")
* Repetitive [[nonsense]] words (e.g., "la la..." (as in "[[Calcutta (song)|Calcutta]]") or "[[Woo-Hoo (Rock-A-Teens song)|Woo Hoo]]")
* Non-musical spoken passages in the background of the track (e.g., "[[To Live Is to Die]]" by [[Metallica]]; "[[Desolation of Eden|Wasteland]]" by [[Chelsea Grin]])
* Wordless vocal effects, such as [[drone (music)|drones]] (e.g., "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" or "[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]")
* [[Vocal percussion]], such as beatbox [[B-sides]] on rap singles
* [[Yodeling]] (e.g., "[[Hocus Pocus (song)|Hocus Pocus]]")
* [[Whistling]] (e.g., "[[I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman]]" or "[[Colonel Bogey March]]")
* Spoken statements at the end of the track (e.g., God Bless the Children of the Beast by [[Mötley Crüe]], [[For the Love of God (instrumental)|For the Love of God]] by [[Steve Vai]])
* Non-musical vocal recordings taken from other media (e.g., "[[Vampires (Godsmack song)|Vampires]]" by [[Godsmack]])
* [[Field recording]]s which may or may not contain non-lyrical words. (e.g., many songs by [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and other [[post-rock]] bands.)

Songs including actual musical—rhythmic, melodic, and lyrical—vocals might still be categorized as instrumentals if the vocals appear only as a short part of an extended piece (e.g., "[[Unchained Melody]]" (Les Baxter), "[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]", "[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]", "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]", "[[Fly, Robin, Fly]]", "[[Get Up and Boogie (song)|Get Up and Boogie]]", "[[Do It Any Way You Wanna]]", and "[[Gonna Fly Now]]"), though this definition is loose and subjective.

Falling just outside of that definition is "[[Theme From Shaft]]" by [[Isaac Hayes]].

The '''Japan Media Arts Festival''' is an annual festival held since 1997 by [[Japan]]'s [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]. The festival begins with an open competition and culminates with the awarding of several prizes and an exhibition.&lt;ref name="OtmazginBen-Ari2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nissim Otmazgin|author2=Eyal Ben-Ari|title=Popular Culture and the State in East and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsKoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|date=March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-62295-3|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cipriani2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Cipriani|title=Culture and Dialogue Vol.3, No. 2 (2013) Issue on "Identity and Dialogue"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t50xBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=2 May 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-5998-1|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G.

Based on judging by a jury of artistic peers, awards are given in four categories: Art (formerly called Non-Interactive Digital Art), Entertainment (formerly called Interactive Art; including [[video games]] and [[websites]]), [[Animation]]&lt;!--note: not anime, as foreign animated films sometimes receive awards--&gt;, and [[Manga]]. Within each category, one Grand Prize, four Excellence Prizes, and (since 2002) one Encouragement Prize are awarded.

[[Image:JuanTamad.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' (The life lived by Lazy John, son of Fabio and Sofia in the Kingdom of Portugal"), published in 1919]]
'''''Juan Tamad''''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Lazy John") is a character in [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[folklore]] noteworthy for extreme [[laziness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Filipinos: Folklore | url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Filipinos.html | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually portrayed as a child, although in some interpretations, he is said to be a young man.

==Stories==
Arguably, the ''Juan Tamad'' story most often told illustrates his utmost laziness to the point of stupidity that it becomes [[comedy|comedic]]. In it, Juan Tamad comes upon a [[guava]] tree bearing ripe fruit. Being too slothful to climb the tree and take the fruits, he instead decides to lie beneath the tree and let [[gravity]] do its work. There he remained, waiting for the fruit to fall into his gaping mouth.

Other ''Juan Tamad'' stories include:
* ''Juan Tamad and the Mud Crabs"
: Juan Tamad is instructed by his mother to purchase [[Scylla serrata|mud crab]]s at the market. Being too lazy to carry them home, he sets them free in a ditch and tells them to go on home, as he would be along later.

* "Juan Tamad and the Rice Cakes"
: Juan Tamad's mother makes some [[Puto|rice cake]]s and instructs him to sell these at the market. Passing by a pond, he sees frogs swimming to and fro. Being too lazy to sell the cakes at the market, he instead throws them at the frogs, who eat the cakes. Upon reaching home, he tells his mother that all the cakes had been sold on credit; the buyers would pay for them the next week.

* "''Juan Tamad and the Flea-Killer''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother instructs him to go to the village market and buy a rice pot. A [[flea]] infestation in the village soon has ''Juan Tamad'' jumping and scratching for all he's worth; he lets go of the pot and it breaks into pieces. Thinking quickly, he picks up the pieces, grinds them into fine powder and wraps the powder in [[banana]] leaves, which he markets as "flea-killer."

* "''Juan Tamad takes a Bride''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother tells him it is time he took a bride. He asks his mother what sort of woman should he look for. His mother replies "a woman of a few words." ''Juan Tamad'' searches long and hard, but all the women he encounters seem to talk too much. Finally, he comes upon a house where an old woman and her daughter live. Upon seeing the girl, he proposes "Will you marry me?" The girl simply stares at him. He tells himself, "Ah, here is a woman of a few words," and lifts her up and takes her back to his mother. His mother chastises him, for he had brought back a corpse.

==Books==
A book published by an unknown author in 1919 in [[Manila]] entitled ''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "The Life lived by Juan Tamad, son of Fabio and Sofia, in the Kingdom of Portugal") contains a poem consisting of 78 pages of four-line [[stanza]]s at seven stanzas per page. It tells of how ''Juan Tamad'' was born to a couple named Fabio and Sofia, and his adventures in [[Portugal]].

In 1957, Manuel E. Arguilla (author of ''How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife'') and Lyd Arguilla wrote the book ''Philippine Tales and Fables'' which included the story of Juan Tamad with illustrations by Romeo V. Tabuena. In 1965, playwright and publisher Alberto Florentino took the Arguillas' re-telling of Juan Tamad and published it as ''Stories of Juan Tamad,'' part of a series of 3 booklets for young readers. Illustrated with woodcuts by the late J. Elizalde Navarro (post-humously declared National Artist for Visual Arts), the book is out-of-print and is now considered a collector's item.

==Films==
Several Filipino [[film]]s have treated ''Juan Tamad'' as a central or supporting character.
* ''Si Juan Tamad '', released in 1947 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Si  Juan Tamad| url=https://italian.imdb.com/title/tt0791573/combined | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Goes to Congress'', released in 1960 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Goes to Congress | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436458/#comment | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Junior'' released in 1980, features [[Niño Muhlach]] as Juan Tamad Jr. and [[Manuel Conde]] as Juan Tamad Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Junior | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167640/ | accessdate = 2000-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mongolian Barbecue The Movie'', released in 1991, features director [[Manuel Urbano, Jr.]]'s television character [[Mr. Shooli]] and [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Mongolian Barbecue The Movie | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437337/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad'', released in 1993, again bills [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441330/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
* GMA 7 had also launched their newest comedy serye, ''Juan Tamad'' with StarStruck Alumni Sef Cadayona, Max Collins, RJ Padilla, Stephanie Sol, &amp; more, the show was premiering on August 23, 2015, a part of GMA 7's 65th Anniversary Offering.

==In Philippine folklore==
{{main article|Philippine mythical creatures}}
''Juan Tamad'' is a man who is buried by monkeys who, because of his laziness, thought he was long dead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13733">[[Image:Kruithof curve 2.svg|right|400px|thumb|The Kruithof curve, with an example light source; [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] (Northern [[daylight]]), inside the pleasing region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/waac/wn/wn21/wn21-3/wn21-308.html|title=The Color of White: Is there a "preferred" color temperature for the exhibition of works of art?|date=September 2000|volume=21|issue=3|first=Steven|last=Weintraub|journal=Western Association for Art Conservation Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Kruithof curve''' describes a region of [[illuminance]] levels and [[color temperature]]s that are often viewed as comfortable or pleasing to an observer. The curve was constructed from [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] data collected by Dutch physicist [[Arie Andries Kruithof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Arie Andries|last=Kruithof|url=http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7789|title=Aanslag van het waterstofmolecuulspectrum door electronen|date=December 12, 1934}} (PhD dissertation at [[Utrecht University]] under [[Leonard Ornstein]]) {{nl icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though the original experimental data is not present on the curve itself. Lighting conditions within the bounded region were [[Empirical evidence|empirically]] assessed as being pleasing or natural, whereas conditions outside the region were considered uncomfortable, displeasing or unnatural.&lt;ref name=Kruithof1941&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruithof|first=Arie Andries|title=Tubular Luminescence Lamps for General Illumination |journal=Philips Technical Review| volume=6|issue=3|pages=65–96|year=1941|issn=0031-7926}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cnspan|1=The Kruithof curve is a sufficient model for describing pleasing|date=March 2017}} [[Light#Light source|sources]] that are considered [[Sunlight|natural]] or closely resemble [[Planck's law|Planckian]] [[Black body|black bodies]], but its value in describing human preference has been consistently questioned by further studies on interior lighting.&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"/&gt;

For example, natural daylight has a color temperature of 6500 [[Kelvin|K]] and an illuminance of about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[lux]]. This color temperature–illuminance pair results in natural [[Color Rendering Index|color rendition]], but if viewed at a low illuminance, would appear bluish. At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing color temperatures are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing color temperatures are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] and [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent sources]], respectively. It is noteworthy that the pleasing region of the curve contains color temperatures and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.

==History==
At the emergence of fluorescent lighting in 1941, Kruithof conducted psychophysical experiments to provide a technical guide to design artificial [[lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viénot|first=Françoise |author2=Marie-Lucie Durand |author3=Elodie Mahler|title=Kruithof's rule revisited using LED illumination|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|date=20 July 2009|volume=56|issue=13|pages=1433–1446|doi=10.1080/09500340903151278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge fluorescent lamps]], Kruithof was able to manipulate the color of emitted light and ask observers to report as to whether or not the source was pleasing to them. The sketch of his curve as presented consists of three major regions: the middle region, which corresponds to light sources considered pleasing; the lower region, which corresponds to colors that are considered cold and dim; and the upper region, which corresponds to colors that are warm and unnaturally colorful. These regions, while approximate, are still used to determine appropriate lighting configurations for homes or offices.

==Perception and adaptation==
[[File:Red geranium photoic mesopic scotopic.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated appearance of a red geranium and foliage in normal bright-light ([[Photopic vision|photopic]]) vision, dusk ([[Mesopic vision|mesopic]]) vision, and night ([[Scotopic vision|scotopic]]) vision. The blueish flower centers are still [[Perception|perceived]] as bright in the image of the flower viewed at dusk and at night.]]
Kruithof's findings are directly related to human [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human [[Spectral sensitivity|sensitivity]] to blue light increases. This is known as the [[Purkinje effect]].&lt;ref name="frisby1980"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Frisby, John P. | title=Seeing: Illusion, Brain and Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | year=1980|isbn=978-0-19-217672-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The human [[visual system]] switches from photopic ([[Cone cell|cone]]-dominated) vision to scotopic ([[Rod cell|rod]]-dominated) vision when [[luminance]] levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral sensitivity to blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral sensitivities to reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] in scotopic vision is most sensitive to blue, human sensitivity to blue light is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.

==Criticism==
While the curve has been used as a guide to design artificial lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low correlated color temperatures at low illuminances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Peter R.|title=Human factors in lighting|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=978-0-7484-0950-1|pages=245–250|edition=2|chapter=Lighting for offices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyce|first1=P.R.|last2=Cuttle|first2=C.|title=Effect of correlated colour temperature on the perception of interiors and colour discrimination|journal=Lighting Research &amp; Technology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–36|doi=10.1177/096032719002200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=RG|last2=Ginthner|first2=DN|title=Correlated color temperature, illuminance level and the Kruithof curve|journal=Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society|date=1990|volume=Winter|pages=27–38|doi=10.1080/00994480.1990.10747937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illuminance and CCT has been examined in many studies of interior lighting &lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vienot|first1=F|last2=Durand|first2=M|last3=Mahler|first3=E|title=Kruithof's rule revisited using LED illumination|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|date=2009|volume=56|issue=13|pages=1433–1466|doi=10.1080/09500340903151278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam et al 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=MS|last2=Dangol|first2=R|last3=Hyvärinen|first3=M|last4=Bhusal|first4=P|last5=Ouolakka|first5=M|last6=Halonen|first6=L|title=User acceptance studies for LED office lighting: Lamp spectrum, spatial brightness and illuminance|journal=Lighting Research and Technology|date=2015|volume=47|pages=54–79|doi=10.1177/1477153513514425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=Minchen|last2=Houser|first2=Kevin W.|last3=Orland|first3=Brian|last4=Lang|first4=Dean H.|last5=Ram|first5=Nilam|last6=Sliwinskiwinski|first6=Martin J.|last7=Bose|first7=Mallika|title=Field study of office worker responses to fluorescent lighting of different CCT and lumen output|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=39|pages=62–76|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.04.009|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these studies consistently demonstrate a different relationship to that suggested by Kruithof.&lt;ref name="Fotios 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotios|first1=Steve|title=A Revised Kruithof Graph Based on Empirical Data|journal=LEUKOS|date=2 January 2017|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1080/15502724.2016.1159137|issn=1550-2724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having upper and lower boundaries, these studies do not suggest CCT to have significant effect and for illuminance suggest only to avoid levels below 300 lux.

==Further studies==
The Kruithof curve, as presented, does not contain experimental data points and serves as an approximation for desirable lighting conditions. Therefore, its scientific accuracy has been reassessed.

Color rendering index is a [[Units of measurement|metric]] for describing the [[Visual appearance|appearance]] of a source and whether or not it is considered pleasing. The color rendering index of a given source is a measure of that source's ability to faithfully reproduce colors of an object. Light sources, like [[candle]]s or incandescent light bulbs produce spectrums of [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] energy that closely resemble Plankian black bodies; they look much like natural sources. Many fluorescent lamps or [[LED lamp|LED light bulbs]] have spectrums that do not match those of Plankian blackbodies and are considered unnatural. Therefore, the way that they render the perceived colors of an environment may be also considered unnatural. While these newer sources can still achieve correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels that are within the comfortable region of the Kruithof curve, variability in their color rendering indices may cause these sources to ultimately be displeasing.

Different activities or scenarios call for different color temperature-illuminance pairs: preferred light sources change depending on the scenario the source is illuminating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://naoyuki-oi.la.coocan.jp/Research/CIE_2007_proceeding.pdf|first=Naoyuki|last=Oi|author2=Hironobu Takahashi|title=Preferred Combinations Between Illuminance and Color Temperature in Several Settings for Daily Living Activities|institution=Kyushu University|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals did prefer color temperature-illuminance pairs within the comfortable region for [[Eating|dining]], [[Socialization|socializing]] and [[Study skills|studying]], but also preferred color temperature-illuminance pairs that were in the lower uncomfortable region for night time activities and preparing for bed. This is linked to the Purkinje effect; individuals who desire some light at night time desire lower (redder) color temperatures even if luminance levels are very low.

Kruithof's findings may also vary as a function of [[culture]] or [[Geography|geographic]] location. Desirable sources are based on an individual's previous experiences of perceiving color, and as different regions of the world may have their own lighting standards, each culture would likely have its own acceptable light sources.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The illuminance of a source is the dominating factor for deciding as to whether or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated color temperature changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodmann|first=H.W.|author2=G. Sollner |author3=E. Voit |title=Evaluation of lighting level with various kinds of light|journal=Proceedings of the CIE|year=1963|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated color temperature and appeared brightness of a source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Han|first=S.|title=Effect of Illuminance, CCT and Decor on the Perception of Lighting|degree=M.S.|publicationplace=[[Troy, New York]]|institution = [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these findings, it is evident that color rendering index, in place of correlated color temperature, may be a more appropriate metric for determining as to whether or not a certain source is considered pleasing.

'''lebenslaute''' (motto: "classical music – political action") is an open [[direct action]] group that combines concerts of [[classical music]] with [[civil disobedience]], mostly by [[Open air concert|open-air]] protest concerts in unexpected locations. ''lebenslaute'' organizes several nonviolence performances per year on both national and regional levels in Germany.

In 2014, ''lebenslaute'' was awarded the renowned [[Peace Prize of Aachen]], Germany, together with the American organization [[Code Pink|Code Pink – Women for Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachener-friedenspreis.de/preistraeger/archiv/jahr-2014.html CodePink and Lebenslaute to be awarded the Peace Prize of Aachen] (de), ''aachener-friedenspreis.de'', 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded in the [[Aula Carolina]] in the city of [[Aachen]] each year on 1 September, the date on which [[International Day of Peace]] is celebrated in Germany, warningly commemorating the day on which [[Nazi Germany]] started [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939.

Since 1986, ''lebenslaute'' has been turning up in places where classical concerts are least expected, with group sizes between three and over one hundred and in professional black outfit. Locations are chosen in the eye of by-laws that would prohibit any activity of this kind in this spot, so political confrontation is consciously sought. Where possible, lebenslaute gives support to and cooperates with local civil disobedience groups. Direct action is deployed in places that are threatening to people or that design and manufacture objects used for killing, with the aim to protest against the official function of such organizations and locations in principle and in practise: any government agency where people are threatened, e.g. [[refugee]]s, any business of the [[arms industry]], any [[airport]] or [[prison]] used for [[deportation]], any [[nuclear power plant]], any [[military base]] and any other location that may have the aim of preparing for or conducting [[warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from http://www.lebenslaute.net, main page, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Every lebenslaute activity is prepared in groups and decisions are taken accordance in [[Grassroots democracy]]. [[Nonviolence]] as a principle is followed inside the groups, too: None of the activists is asked to do more than they want to. In case of legal proceedings following suit, individuals can be sure to be shown solidarity by other group members and by the group itself in cooperation with allied organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from [http://www.lebenslaute.net?page_id=17 About us], ''lebenslaute.net'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political action by ''lebenslaute'' took place in 1986 when a huge classical orchestra blocked the entrance to the US military base of [[Pershing II]] [[ballistic missile]]s near the town of [[Mutlangen]] in a rural area of [[Baden-Württemberg]], South-Western Germany.

'''''Lincoln Portrait''''' (also known as '''''A Lincoln Portrait''''') is a classical [[orchestral work]] written by the American composer [[Aaron Copland]]. The work involves a full [[orchestra]], with particular emphasis on the [[Brass instrument|brass]] section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s great documents, including the [[Gettysburg Address]]. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.

==History==
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Aaron Copland Lincoln Portrait.ogg|title=''Lincoln Portrait''|description=A 23 second sample demonstrating the narration, by [[Gregory Peck]], of Lincoln's documents along with the prominence of brass instruments for dramatic emphasis}}
Copland was asked to write a musical portrait of an "eminent American" by the conductor [[Andre Kostelanetz]]. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including "[[Camptown Races]]" and "[[On Springfield Mountain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/catalogue/cat_detail.asp?musicid=2103 |title=''Lincoln Portrait''|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes|date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Copland finished ''Lincoln Portrait'' in April 1942.

The first performance was by the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] on 14 May 1942, with [[William Adams (who?)|William Adams]] as the narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollack|first=Howard|title=Aaron Copland: the life and work of an uncommon man|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Together with some descriptive comments on Lincoln ("Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or
insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, [[State of the Union]]], December 1, 1862)

The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)

It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. ([[Lincoln–Douglas debates]], October 15, 1858)

As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's ''Collected Works'')

That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. ([[Gettysburg Address]])

==In Venezuela==
[[Juana Sujo]], an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to [[Caracas]] to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of ''Lincoln Portrait'' on March 27, 1957. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer said it had a "magical effect" on the audience.{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}}

As Copland recalled, "To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment." On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, "... [[Gettysburg Address|that government of the people, by the people, for the people]] (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth," the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, "It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the ''Lincoln Portrait'' was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état|a revolution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holzer|first1=Harold|authorlink1=Harold Holzer|editor1-last=Cuomo|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Holzer|editor2-first=Harold|editor1-link=Mario M.

==Popular culture==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2017}}
The composition was [[parody|lampooned]] by [[Peter Schickele]] ("[[P. D. Q. Bach]]") in his piece ''Bach Portrait'' on the album ''[[1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults]]''. Another parody, "A Quayle Portrait" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quayle Portrait|url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=1275|author=Mad Music Productions, LLC}}{{sps|certain=y|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevant Dr. Demento show playlists reviewable at dmdb.org: 1991-04-21, 1991-06-16, 1992-06-21 --&gt;

Nine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ray Allen]]) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, ''[[He Got Game]]''. In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in Brooklyn.

This is a '''list of genres''' of literature and entertainment, excluding [[:Category:Art genres|genres in the visual arts]]. [[Genre]] is the term for any category of literature or other forms of art or entertainment, e.g. music, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria. Genres are formed by conventions that change over time as new genres are invented and the use of old ones are discontinued. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions.

== Literary genres ==
{{Main|Literary genre}}
{{Main list|List of writing genres}}

===Absurdist/surreal/whimsical===
[[Absurdist fiction|Absurdist]] and [[Surreal humour|surreal]] fiction challenges causal reasoning and the purposefulness of life.  There is often, though not always, a connection to comedy.

Whimsical has to do with a sense of eccentric or quirky humor. Related styles exaggerate real life in a whimsical, eccentric, quirky or fanciful way, sometimes including 'magical' extensions of reality.

The [[Absurdist fiction|absurdist]] genre focuses on the experiences of characters in situations where they cannot find any inherent [[Meaning of life|purpose in life]], most often represented by ultimately meaningless actions and events that call into question the certainty of existential concepts such as truth or value.

The closely related/overlapping [[Surreal humour|surreal]] genre is predicated on deliberate violations of [[Causality|causal]] reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously [[illogical]]. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].

Whimsical and related styles are exemplified by films such as [[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]], [[Amélie]], [[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]] and Dieta Mediterranea (Mediterranean Food).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1198340/ |title=Dieta mediterránea |trans-title=Mediterranean Food |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action===
An [[Action (fiction)|action]] story is similar to [[adventure]], and the protagonist usually takes a risky turn, which leads to desperate situations (including [[explosion]]s, [[stage combat|fight scenes]], daring escapes, etc.). Action and Adventure are usually categorized together (sometimes even as "action-adventure") because they have much in common, and many stories fall under both genres simultaneously (for instance, the [[James Bond]] series can be classified as both).

* [[Heroic bloodshed]]: [[Hong Kong]] action revolving around stylized sequences and dramatic themes such as brotherhood, duty, honor, redemption and violence.
* [[Military fiction]]: A story about a war or battle that can either be historical or fictional. It usually follows the events a certain warrior goes through during the battle's events.
* [[Spy fiction]]: A story about a secret agent (spy) or military personnel member who is sent on a secret [[espionage]] mission. Usually, they are equipped with special gadgets that prove useful during the mission, and they have special training in things such as [[unarmed combat]] or [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]]. They may or may not work for a specific [[government]].
* [[Wuxia]]: A martial arts genre with chivalrous protagonists on fantastic adventures.
* [[Girls with guns]] and swords: This is a lsdkfh of action films and animation, often Asian films and [[anime]], that portray a strong female protagonist who makes use of dgfhj to defend against or attack a group of antagonists. The genre typically involves gun-play, stunts and martial arts action.

===Adventure===
An [[Adventure fiction|adventure story]] is about a [[protagonist]] who journeys to epic or distant places to accomplish something. It can have many other genre elements included within it,
because it is a very open genre. The protagonist has a mission and faces obstacles to get to their destination. Also, adventure stories usually include unknown settings and characters with prized properties or features.

* [[Shōnen manga]]: A [[manga]] usually tends to be marketed to males roughly aged 10 and above. It is typically characterized by high-action, often humorous plots featuring male protagonists. The camaraderie between boys or men on sports teams, fighting squads, and the like is often emphasized. Attractive female characters with exaggerated features are also common.
* [[Superhero fiction]]: A story that examines the adventures of costumed crime fighters known as superheroes, who often possess superhuman powers and battle similarly powered criminals known as supervillains.

===Comedy===
[[Comedy]] is a story that tells about a series of funny, or comical events, intended to make the audience laugh. It is a very open genre, and thus crosses over with many other genres on a frequent basis.

* [[Comedy of manners]]: A film [[satire|satirizes]] the manners and affectations of a [[social class]], often represented by [[stock character]]s. The plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other [[scandal]], but is generally less important than its witty [[dialogue]]. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]''.
* [[Laughter in literature|Humorous]]: Fiction full of fun, fancy, and excitement. Meant to entertain.
* [[Tall tale]]: A humorous story with blatant exaggeration, swaggering heroes who do the impossible with nonchalance.
* [[Parody]]: A story that mocks or [[satire|satirizes]] other genres, people, [[fictional character]]s or works. Such works employ [[sarcasm]], [[stereotype|stereotyping]], mockery of scenes, symbols or lines from other works, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Such stories may be "affectionate parodies" meant to entertain those familiar with the references of the parody, or they may well be intended to undercut the respectability of the original inspiration for the parody by pointing out its [[wiktionary: flaw|flaw]]s (the latter being closer to [[satire]]).
* [[Romantic comedy]] aka RomCom: A subgenre that combines the romance genre with comedy, focusing on two or more individuals as they discover and attempt to deal with their [[romantic love]], attractions to each other. The [[stereotypical]] plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot (as well as new twists, such as reversing the [[gender role]]s in the story), and much of the generally lighthearted comedy lies in the social interactions and [[sexual tension]] between the characters, who very often either refuse to admit they are attracted to one another or must deal with others' meddling in their affairs.
* [[Comic fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as low fantasy in contrast to high fantasy, which is primarily serious in intent and tone. The term "low fantasy" is also used to represent other types of fantasy, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature.
* [[Comedy horror]]: See ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]''.
* [[Black comedy]] (or dark comedy): A parody or satirical story that is based on normally tragic or [[taboo]] subjects, including [[death]], [[murder]], [[suicide]], [[illicit drug]]s and [[war]]. So-called "dead baby comedy" sometimes falls under this genre.
* [[Zombie comedy]]: Often called zom com or zomedy, this is a genre that blends zombie horror motifs with slapstick comedy as well as dark comedy.
* [[Comic science fiction]]: A comedy that uses [[science fiction]] elements or settings, often as a lighthearted (or occasionally vicious) parody of the latter genre.
* [[Satire]]: Often strictly defined as a [[literary genre|literary genre or form]], though in practice it is also found in the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s. In [[satire]], human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, [[burlesque]], [[irony]], or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using [[wit]]. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or [[sarcasm]], but [[parody]], burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that "in satire, irony is militant." This "militant irony" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack.

===Crime===
(See also: '''Mystery''' below)

A [[Crime fiction|crime]] story is about a crime that is being committed or was committed. It can also be an account of a criminal's life. It often falls into the action or adventure genres.

* [[Legal drama|Courtroom drama]]: A television show subgenre of dramatic programming. This subgenre presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc. Legal dramas come in all shapes and sizes and may also span into other forms of media, including novels, plays, television shows, and films.
* [[Detective fiction|Detective story]]: A story about a detective or person, either professional or amateur, who has to solve a crime that was committed. They must figure out who committed the crime and why. Sometimes, the detective must figure out 'how' the criminal committed the crime if it seems impossible.
** [[Whodunnit]]: This is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric amateur or semi-professional detective.
* [[Gangster]]: Literature that focuses on gangs, criminal organizations that provide a level of organization, and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters are the subject of many movies, particularly from the period between 1930 and 1960.  A revival of [[gangster]] type movies took place since the 1990s with the explosion of hip-hop culture.  Unlike the earlier gangster films, the newer films share similar elements to the older films but is more in a hip-hop urban setting.
* [[Gentleman thief]]: Centers around particularly well-behaving and apparently well-bred thieves. They rarely bother with anonymity or force, preferring to rely on their charisma, physical attractiveness, and clever misdirection to steal the most unobtainable objects{{snd}}sometimes for their own support, but mostly for the thrill of the act itself.
* [[Gong'an fiction]]: A subgenre of historical [[Chinese crime fiction|crime fiction]] that involves government magistrates who solve criminal cases.
* [[Hardboiled]]: This is a literary genre sharing the setting with crime fiction (especially detective stories). Though deriving from the romantic tradition, which emphasized the emotions of apprehension, horror and terror, and awe, hardboiled fiction deviates from the tradition in the detective's cynical attitude towards those emotions. The attitude is conveyed through the detective's self-talk describing to the reader (or{{snd}}in the film{{snd}}to the viewer) what he is doing and feeling.
*Heist: A thriller in which a criminal or group of criminals conceives and executes a major robbery. The theft usually involves gaining access to valuables stored in a high-security location, and the thieves may or may not use subterfuge to trick their way into and/or out of the stronghold.
* [[Legal thriller]]: A subgenre of thriller and crime fiction in which the major characters are lawyers and their employees. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. Usually, crusading lawyers become involved in proving their cases (usually their client's innocence of the crime he is accused of, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation that has covered its malfeasance) to such an extent that they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives.
* [[Crime fiction|Murder mystery]]: A mystery story that focuses on [[homicide]]s. Usually, the detective must figure out who killed one or several victims. They may or may not find themselves or loved ones in danger because of this investigation. The genre often includes elements of the [[suspense|suspense story]] genre, or of the [[Action (fiction)|action]] and [[adventure]] genres.

===Drama===
{{main|Drama (film and television)}}
Within film, television and radio (but not [[theatre]]), [[Drama (genre)|drama]] is a genre of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] (or [[docudrama|semi-fiction]]) intended to be more serious than [[humor]]ous in tone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|title=Drama|year=2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drama|quote=a play, movies, television show, or radio show that is about a serious subject and is not meant to make the audience laugh}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on in-depth [[characterization|development]] of realistic characters who must deal with realistic emotional struggles. A drama is commonly considered the opposite of a [[comedy]], but may also be considered separate from other works of some broad genre, such as a [[fantasy]].

* [[Comedy-drama]]
* [[Crime drama]] 
* [[Docudrama]]
* [[Historical period drama]]
* [[Horror film|Horror drama]]
* [[Legal drama]]
* [[Melodrama]]
* [[Military drama]]
* [[Romance film|Romantic drama]]
* [[Teen drama]]

===Fantasy===
[[File:The Whirlwind Seizes the Wreath.jpg|thumb|The Whirlwind Seizes the Wreath]]
A [[fantasy]] story is about [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] or [[supernatural]] forces, rather than technology (as [[science fiction]]) if it happens to take place in a modern or future era. Depending on the extent of these other elements, the story may or may not be considered to be a "hybrid genre" series; for instance, even though the [[Harry Potter]] series [[canon (fiction)|canon]] includes the requirement of a particular [[gene]] to be a wizard, it is referred to only as a fantasy series.

* [[Bangsian]]: A fantasy genre that concerns the use of famous literary or historical individuals and their interactions in the afterlife. It is named for [[John Kendrick Bangs]], who often wrote in this genre.
* [[Contemporary fantasy]] (also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy): A subgenre of fantasy, set in the present day. These are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds.
** [[Urban fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy defined by place; the fantastic narrative has an urban setting. Many urban fantasies are set in contemporary times and contain supernatural elements. However, the stories can take place in historical, modern, or futuristic periods, as well as fictional settings. The prerequisite is that they must be primarily set in a city.
* [[Dark fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy that can refer to literary, artistic, and filmic works that combine fantasy with elements of horror. The term can be used broadly to refer to fantastical works that have a dark, gloomy atmosphere or a sense of horror and dread and a dark, often brooding, tone.
* [[Fable]]s: A type of narration demonstrating a useful truth. Animals speak as humans, legendary, supernatural tale.
* [[Fairy Tale]]s: A literary genre about various magical creatures, environments, et cetera. Many  fairy tales are generally targeted for children.
*[[Hard fantasy]]: Fantasy where the magical elements are constructed in a logical and rational manner.
* [[High fantasy|Epic/High fantasy]]: Mythical stories with highly developed characters and story lines. E.g. Malazan Book of the Fallen and The Lord of the Rings
* [[Heroic fantasy]]: subgenre of fantasy that chronicles the tales of heroes in imaginary lands. Frequently, the protagonist is reluctant to be a champion, is of low or humble origin, and has royal ancestors or parents but does not know it. Though events are usually beyond their control, they are thrust into positions of great responsibility where their mettle is tested in a number of spiritual and physical challenges.
* [[Historical fantasy]]: a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into the historical narrative.
* [[Legend]]s: Stories, oftentimes of a national hero or other [[Folklore|folk]] figure, which have a basis in fact, but also contain imaginative material.
* [[Magical girl]]: Popular in Japan, of girls who use magic in either their training, idol stardom or even to fight evil.
* [[Mythic fiction]]: Literature that is rooted in, inspired by, or that in some way draws from the tropes, themes and symbolism of myth, folklore, and fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://endicottstudio.typepad.com/jomareadinglists/2007/10/a-mythic-fictio.html A Mythic Fiction Reading List]", ''The Journal of Mythic Arts''&lt;/ref&gt; The term is widely credited to Charles de Lint and Terri Windling. Mythic fiction overlaps with urban fantasy and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but mythic fiction also includes contemporary works in non-urban settings. Mythic fiction refers to works of contemporary literature that often cross the divide between literary and fantasy fiction.
* [[Science fantasy]]: A story with mystical elements that are scientifically explainable, or that combine science fiction elements with fantasy elements. Note that [[science fiction]] was once referred to by this name, but that it no longer denotes that genre, and has somewhat fallen out of favor as a genre descriptor.
** [[Sword and planet]]: A [[subgenre]] of [[science fantasy]] that features rousing adventure stories set on other planets, and usually featuring Earthmen as protagonists.  There is a fair amount of overlap between "Sword &amp; Planet" and "[[planetary romance]]" though some works are considered to belong to one and not the other. In general, Planetary Romance is considered to be more of a [[Space Opera]] subgenre, influenced by the likes of ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' yet more modern and technologically savvy, while Sword &amp; Planet more directly imitates the conventions established by Burroughs in the [[Barsoom|Mars series]].
** [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth]]: A sub-[[subgenre]] of [[science fantasy]] that takes place either at the [[Future of the Earth|end of life on Earth]] or the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|End of Time]], when the laws of the universe themselves fail. More generally, the Dying Earth subgenre encompasses [[science fiction]] works set in the far distant future in a milieu of stasis or decline. Themes of world-weariness, [[innocence]] (wounded or otherwise), idealism, [[entropy]], (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to pre-dominate.
** [[Gaslamp fantasy]]: Fantasy's counterpart to [[steampunk]], in which the settings are often Victorian or Edwardian socially or technologically, but with non-scientific elements or characters included. 
* [[Shenmo]]: A genre of fantasy that revolves around the gods and monsters of [[Chinese mythology]].
* [[Sword and sorcery]]: A blend of heroic fantasy, adventure, and frequent elements of the horrific in which a mighty barbaric warrior hero is pitted against both human and supernatural adversaries. Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Cimmerian, Kull of Atlantis, the Pictish king Bran Mak Morn, etc. is generally acknowledged as the founder of the genre, chiefly through his writings for ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and other 1920s and 1930s pulp magazines.

===Historical===
A story about a real person or event. Often, they are written in a [[text book]] format, which may or may not focus on solely that.

* [[Biography]]: The details of the life story of a real person, told by someone else.
** [[Autobiography]]: Essentially the same as a [[biography]], with the exception that the story is written by the person who is the subject of the story.
** [[Memoir]]: Similar to [[autobiography]], with the exception that it is told more "from memory", i.e. it is how the person personally remembers and feels about their life or a stage in their life, more than the exact, recorded details of that period. Though memoirs are often more [[subjectivity|subjective]] than  [[autobiography]] works, memoirs are generally still considered to be [[nonfiction]] works. There are also some [[fiction]] works that purport to be the "memoirs" of [[fictional character]]s as well, done in a similar style, however, these are in a separate genre from their nonfiction counterparts.
* [[Historical fiction]]: A story that takes place in the real world, with real world people, but with several fictionalized or dramatized elements. This may or may not [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with other genres; for example, [[fantasy fiction]] or [[science fiction]] may play a part, as is the case for instance with the novel ''[[George Washington's Socks]]'', which includes [[time travel]] elements.
** [[Alternate history]]: A more extreme variant of [[historical fiction]] which posits a "what if" scenario in which some historical event occurs differently (or not at all), thus altering the course of [[history]]; for instance, "What if Nazi Germany had won World War II?" is an alternate history concept that has had treatment in fiction. Alternate History is sometimes (though not universally) referred to as a subgenre of [[science fiction]] or [[speculative fiction]], and like [[historical fiction]], may include more fantastical elements (for instance, the ''[[Temeraire (series)|Temeraire'' series]] uses the fantasy element of [[dragon]]s to create an Alternate History plot set during the [[Napoleonic Era]]).
** [[Counterfactual history]]: Referred to as '''virtual history''', it is a recent form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer counterfactual "what if" questions. It seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had a different outcome. This exercise ascertains the relative importance of the event, incident or person the counter-factual hypothesis negates.
** [[Period piece]]: This type features historical places, people, or events that may or not be crucial to the story. Because history is merely used as a backdrop, it may be fictionalized to various degrees, but the story itself may be regarded as "outside" history. Genres within this category are often regarded as significant categories in themselves.
*** [[Jidaigeki]]: A story usually set in the Edo period of [[Japan]]ese history, from 1603 to 1868.
** [[Costume drama]]: A type of drama that especially relies on lavish costumes and designs. This type crosses over with many other genres.

===Historical fiction===
The genre historical fiction includes stories that are about the past. To distinguish historical fiction from any fiction that is written about an era in the past, the criteria that the book must have been written about a time that occurred in a historical context in relation to the author of the book.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria that the story be set before the middle of the previous century is sometimes added.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Historical fiction stories include historical details and includes characters that fit into the time period of the setting, whether or not they are real historical people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Horror===
[[File:Paul Gustave Dore Raven1.jpg|thumb|alt=An Illustration of Poe's 'The Raven' by Gustav Dore|An Illustration of Poe's '[[The Raven]]' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
A [[Horror fiction|horror]] story is told to deliberately scare or frighten the audience, through suspense, violence or shock. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] distinguishes two primary varieties in the "Introduction" to ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'': 1) Physical Fear or the "mundanely gruesome" and 2) the true Supernatural Horror story or the "Weird Tale". The supernatural variety is occasionally called "dark fantasy", since the laws of nature must be violated in some way, thus qualifying the story as "fantastic".

* [[Ghost story]]: A story about the intrusion of the spirits of the dead into the realm of the living. There are subgenres: The Traditional Haunting, Poltergeists, The Haunted Place or Object (i.e. the hotel in Stephen King's ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''), or the etching in M. R. James' [http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/mezztint.htm "The Mezzotint"], etc. Some would include stories of Revenants such as [[W. W. Jacobs]]' [http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/mnkyspaw.htm "The Monkey's Paw."]
* [[Monster]]: A story about a monster, creature or mutant that terrorizes people. Usually, it fits into the horror genre, for instance, [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is often also considered the first [[science fiction]] story (biological science reanimating the dead), but it does present a monstrous "creature.  Other clear Monster stories are of the creatures of folklore and fable: the Vampire, the Ghoul, the Werewolf, the Zombie, etc.  Beings such as that depicted in Karloff's ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' would also qualify.
** [[Kaiju|Giant monsters]]: A story about a giant monster, big enough to destroy buildings. Some such stories are about two giant monsters fighting each other, a genre known as ''[[kaiju]]'' in Japan, which is famous for such works after the success of such films and franchises such as ''[[Godzilla]]''.
* [[Werewolf fiction]]: Stories about [[werewolf|werewolves]], humans with the ability to shapeshift into wolves.
* [[Jiangshi fiction]]: Stories about [[jiangshi]], the hopping corpses under the control of Taoist priests derived from [[Chinese literature]] and folklore.
* [[Vampire literature]]: A story about [[vampire]]s, reanimated bodies that feed on the blood of the living, based on European folklore. [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' created many of the genre's conventions.
* [[Ghost story|Occult stories]]: Stories that touch upon the adversaries of Good, especially the "Enemies" of the forces of righteousness as expressed in any given religious philosophy.  Hence, stories of devils, demons, demonic possession, dark witchcraft, evil sorcerers or warlocks, and figures like the Antichrist would qualify. The nature of such stories presupposes the existence of the side of Good and the existence of a deity to be opposed to the forces of Evil.
* [[Slasher film|Slasher]]: A horror genre featuring a [[serial killer]] or other [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] as an [[Antagonist (literature)|antagonist]], methodically killing a number of protagonists in succession. Dramatic suspense is heightened by the victims' obliviousness of the killer. The victims are typically in isolated settings and often engaged in sexual activity previous to the attacks. The "slasher" kills their victims by sneaking up on them and then bloodily stabbing and slicing them to death with a sharp object, such as a [[chef's knife]]. Gender roles in slasher films are of particular interest in [[feminist film theory]], which has extensively examined the trope of the [[Final girl]].
* [[Survival horror]]: A horror story about a protagonist in a risky and life-threatening situation that they must endure, often as a result of things such as [[zombie]]s or other monsters, and the rest of the plot is how the main characters overcome this.

===Magical realism===
Magical realism, also called [[Magic realism]], is literary works where magical events form part of ordinary life. The reader is forced to accept that abnormal events such as levitation, telekinesis and talking with the dead take place in the real world. The writer does not invent a new world or describe in great detail new creatures, as is usual in Fantasy; on the contrary, the author abstains from explaining the fantastic events to avoid making them feel extraordinary. It is often regarded as a genre exclusive to [[Latin American literature]], but some of its chief exponents include English authors. [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]], by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], who received the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], is considered the genre's seminal work of style.

===Mystery===
A [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] story follows an investigator as he/she attempts to solve a puzzle (often a crime). The details and clues are presented as the story continues and the protagonist discovers them and by the end of the story the mystery/puzzle is solved.  For example, in the case of a crime mystery the perpetrator and motive behind the crime are revealed and the perpetrator is brought to justice. Mystery novels are often written in series, which facilitates a more in-depth development of the primary investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to  Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific types of mystery story include [[Locked-room mystery|locked room mysteries]] and [[Cozy mystery|cozy mysteries]].

===Paranoid Fiction===
[[Paranoid fiction]] is works of [[literature]] that explore the [[subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world they are in.

===Philosophical===
[[Philosophical fiction]] is fiction in which a significant proportion of the work is devoted to a discussion of the sort of questions normally addressed in discursive philosophy. These might include the function and role of society, the purpose of life, ethics or morals, the role of art in human lives, and the role of experience or reason in the development of knowledge. Philosophical fiction works would include the so-called novel of ideas, including a significant proportion of science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction, and Bildungsroman. The modus operandi seems to be to use a normal story to simply explain difficult and dark parts of human life.

* [[Bildungsroman]]: A [[coming-of-age]] novel presenting the psychological, moral and social shaping of the personality of a character, usually the [[protagonist]]. The genre arose during the [[German Enlightenment]].

===Political===
[[Political fiction]] is a subgenre of fiction that deals with [[political affairs]]. Political fiction has often used narrative to provide commentary on political events, systems and theories. Works of political fiction often "directly criticize an existing society or... present an alternative, sometimes fantastic, reality." Prominent pieces of political fiction have included the totalitarian dystopias of the early 20th century such as [[Jack London|Jack London's]] ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' and [[Sinclair Lewis|Sinclair Lewis's]] ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]''. Equally influential, if not more so, have been earlier pieces of political fiction such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) and ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). Political fiction frequently employs the literary modes of satire, often in the genres of [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]] or [[social science fiction]].

* [[Utopian fiction]]: The creation of an ideal world, or utopia, as the setting for a novel
* [[Dystopian fiction]]: The creation of a nightmare world, or dystopia, as the setting for a novel
* [[Survivalism]]: The creation of world where traditional society has collapsed usually due to some post apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, as a setting for a novel

===Romance===
The term "romance" has multiple [[Historical romance#Definition|meanings]]; ''[[historical romances]]'' like those of [[Walter Scott]] would use the term to mean "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;.Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; But most often a romance is understood to be "love stories", emotion-driven stories that are primarily focused on the relationship between the main characters of the story. Beyond the focus on the relationship, the biggest defining characteristic of the romance genre is that a ''happy ending'' is always guaranteed...&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = American Library Association|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = Chicago|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = Libraries Unlimited|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = California|pages = 229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps marriage and living "happily ever after", or simply that the reader sees hope for the future of the romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the wide definition of romance, romance stories cover a wide variety of subjects and often fall into other genre categories as well as romance,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  such as [[Comedy-Romance]] (also known as '''romcom''' films), [[romantic suspense]] and (less common now): subcategories such as '''hospital romances''', as found in the novels by [[Lucilla Andrews]]. See [[Mills &amp; Boon#Imprints|Mills &amp; Boon imprint categories]] and [[Harlequin Enterprises#Harlequin category romance imprints|Harlequin romances categories]] for a partial list of other sub-genres.

===Saga===
The [[saga]]s (from Icelandic saga, plural sögur) are stories about ancient Scandinavian and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, about migration to Iceland, and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. The texts are epic tales in prose, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, tales of worthy men, who were often Vikings, sometimes Pagan, sometimes Christian. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.

* [[Family saga]]: The  family saga chronicles the lives and doings of a family or a number of related or interconnected families over a period of time. In novels (or sometimes [[novel sequence|sequences of novels]]) with a serious intent, this is often a thematic device used to portray particular historical events, changes of social circumstances, or the ebb and flow of fortunes from a multiple of perspectives.

===Satire===
Often strictly defined as a [[literary genre|literary genre or form]], though in practice it is also found in the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s. In [[satire]], human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, [[burlesque]], [[irony]], or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using [[wit]]. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or [[sarcasm]], but [[parody]], burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that "in satire, irony is militant." This "militant irony" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack.

===Science fiction===
[[Science fiction]] is similar to [[fantasy]], except stories in this genre use scientific understanding to explain the universe that it takes place in. It generally includes or is centered on the presumed effects or ramifications of [[computer]]s or [[machine]]s; travel through [[Intergalactic travel|space]], [[time travel|time]] or [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s; [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] life-forms; [[genetic engineering]]; or other such things. The science or technology used may or may not be very thoroughly elaborated on; stories whose scientific elements are reasonably detailed, well-researched and considered to be relatively plausible given current knowledge and technology are often referred to as [[hard science fiction]].

* [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]]: concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] either through [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[pandemic|plague]], or some other [[disaster|general disaster]].  Post-apocalyptic fiction  is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between this form of science fiction and fiction that deals with false utopias or [[dystopia|dystopic societies]].
* [[Hard science fiction]]: where the science is detailed, well-researched, and considered plausible such as ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' or ''[[Prey (novel)]]''.
** [[Tech noir]]: A hybrid of other works of fiction combining the [[film noir]] and [[science fiction]] or [[cyberpunk]] genres such as seen in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984). It is a form of [[Neo-noir]] concentrating more on [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]]. The term was coined in ''The Terminator''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} as the name of a nightclub, ''Tech Noir''. The director [[James Cameron]] wanted a name for the particular style he was invoking.
* [[Soft science fiction]]: not detailed about the science involved, and typically deals more with cultural, social, and political interactions.
** [[Comic science fiction]]: exploits the genre's conventions for [[comedy|comic]] effect.
** [[Military science fiction]]: told from the point of view of the military, or a main character who is a soldier in the military. It usually has technology far superior to today's, but not necessarily implausible. Military science fiction essentially is the addition of science fiction elements into a [[war novel|military fiction]] story. (Note that some military science fiction stories fit at least somewhat into the "hard science fiction" subgenre as well.)
** [[Feminist science fiction]]: tends to deal with women's roles in society. It poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the unequal political, economic and personal power of men and women. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or [[dystopias]] to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.
** [[Libertarian science fiction]]: focuses on the politics and social order implied by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophies with an emphasis on [[individualism]] and a limited state{{snd}}and in some cases, [[anarcho-capitalism|no state whatsoever]]. As a genre, it can be seen as growing out of the 1930s and 1940s when the science-fiction [[pulp magazines]] were reaching their peak at the same time as [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. While this environment gave rise to [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', in the pulps, this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies (or sub-groups) arising in direct opposition to totalitarianism.
** [[Social science fiction]]: concerned less with the scientific background and more with sociological speculation about human society. In other words, it "absorbs and discusses anthropology", and speculates about human behavior and interactions. Exploration of fictional societies is one of the most interesting aspects of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive and precautionary functions, to criticize the contemporary world and to present solutions, to portray alternative societies and to examine the implications of ethical principles.
* [[Space opera]]: A story characterized by the extent of [[Intergalactic travel|space travel]] and distinguished by the amount of time that protagonists spend in an active, space-faring lifestyle. ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Blazers]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' have often been categorized as such.
** [[Science fiction Western]]: has elements of science fiction in a [[Western (genre)|Western]] setting. It is different from a [[Space Western]], which is a frontier story indicative of [[American Old West|American Westerns]], except transposed to a backdrop of [[outer space|space]] exploration and settlement.
** [[Planetary romance]]: the bulk of the action consists of adventures on one or more exotic alien planets, characterized by distinctive physical and cultural backgrounds. Some planetary romances take place against the background of a future culture where travel between worlds by spaceship is commonplace; others, particularly the earliest examples of the genre, do not, and invoke [[flying carpet]]s, astral projection, or other methods of getting between planets. In either case, the planetside adventures are the focus of the story, not the mode of travel.
** [[Space Western]]: transposes themes of [[American Old West|American Western]] books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers; it is the complement of the [[science fiction Western]], which transposes science fiction ''themes'' onto an American Western ''setting''.
* Punk: Several different Science Fiction subgenres, normally categorized by distinct technologies and sciences. The themes tend to be [[cynical]] or [[dystopian]], and a person, or group of people, fighting the [[Political corruption|corruption]] of the government.
** [[Cyberpunk]]: A futuristic storyline dealing with people who have been physically or mentally enhanced with [[cybernetic]] components, often featuring [[cyborg]]s or [[Technological singularity|the singularity]] as a major theme, and generally somewhat [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] or [[dystopian]] (hence the "punk" portion of the name). This is often confused or placed with [[Techno-thriller]], which is actually a separate and less specialized genre.
*** [[Postcyberpunk]]: some critics suggest has evolved from [[cyberpunk]]. Like its predecessor, postcyberpunk focuses on technological developments in near-future societies, typically examining the social effects of a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, [[genetic engineering]], modification of the human body, and the continued impact of perpetual technological change. Unlike "pure" cyberpunk, the works in this category feature characters who act to improve social conditions or at least protect the [[status quo]] from further decay.
** [[Retrofuturism|Retropunk]]: As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, playing off the cyberpunk label, and focusing on technology and its social effects in different ways.  Many derivatives of cyberpunk are retro-futuristic, based either on the futuristic visions of past eras, or more recent extrapolations or exaggerations of the actual technology of those eras.
*** [[Atompunk]]: relates to the pre-digital, cultural period of 1945–65, including mid-century [[Modernism]], the "[[Atom]]ic Age", the "[[Space]] Age", [[Communism]] and [[paranoia]] in the US along with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] styling, [[underground cinema]], [[Googie]] architecture, space and the [[Sputnik]], moon landing, superhero-comics, art &amp; radioactivity, the rise of the US military/industrial complex &amp; the fall-out of [[Chernobyl]]. Communist analog atompunk is an ultimate lost world. The [[Fallout (series)|Fallout]] series of computer games is an excellent example of atompunk.
*** [[Dieselpunk]]: Initially proposed as a genre by the creators of the role-playing game ''[[Children of the Sun (role-playing game)|Children of the Sun]]'', [[dieselpunk]] refers to fiction inspired by mid-century pulp stories, based on the aesthetics of the [[interbellum]] period through [[World War II]] (c. 1920–45). Similar to steampunk though specifically characterized by the rise of petroleum power and technocratic perception, incorporating neo-noir elements and sharing themes more clearly with [[cyberpunk]] than [[steampunk]]. Though the notability of [[dieselpunk]] as a genre is not entirely uncontested, installments ranging from the retro-futuristic film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' to the 2001 Activision video game ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' have been suggested as quintessential [[dieselpunk]] works of fiction.
*** [[Steampunk]]: A story that takes place around the time [[steam power]] was first coming into use. The [[industrial revolution]] is a common time setting for [[steam punk]] stories, and the steam technology is often actually more advanced than the real technology of the time (for instance, ''[[Steam Detectives]]'' features steam-powered robots). The most immediate form of steampunk subculture is the community of fans surrounding the genre. Others move beyond this, attempting to adopt a "steampunk" aesthetic through fashion, home decor and even music.
*** [[Clockpunk]]: This term has occasionally referred to a subgenre of speculative fiction that is similar to steampunk, but deviates in its technology. As with steampunk, it portrays advanced technology based on pre-modern designs, but rather than the steam power of the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]], the technology used is based on springs, clockwork and similar. Clockpunk is based very intensively on the works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and as such, it is typically set during the [[Renaissance]]. It is regarded as being a type of [[steampunk]].
** [[Biopunk]]: A story that is about genetics and biological research (often falling under the horror category). It often focuses on some harmful effects characters have created when they change an animal's code to (unintentionally) create a violent monster. Biopunk emerged during the 1990s and depicts the underground of the biotechnological revolution that was expected to start having a profound impact on humanity in the first half of the 21st century. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of [[human experimentation]], against a backdrop of [[totalitarian]] governments or [[megacorporation]]s that misuse [[biotechnologies]] for [[social control]] or [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]]. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on [[information technology]] but on [[synthetic biology]].
*** [[Nanopunk]]: similar bio-punk, but depicts a world where the use of [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]] are limited or prohibited, so only [[nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]] in wide use (while in [[biopunk]] bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist). Currently the genre is more concerned with the artistic and physiological impact of nanotechnology, than of aspects of the technology itself, which is still in its infancy. Unlike the cyberpunk, a low-life yet technologically advanced character, the personification of a nanopunk can be set 'hard' or 'soft', depending on your views of the impact nanotechnology will have on our future.

=== Social ===
{{Distinguish|Social film}}
In Indian cinema terminology, social films (or simply socials) are films with a contemporary setting, as opposed to those with mythological and period settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/menaka-1935/article3022401.ece|title=Menaka 1935|last=Guy|first=Randor|date=January 4, 2008|work=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=November 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculative===
[[Speculative fiction|Speculative]] fiction speculates about worlds that are unlike the real world in various important ways.  In these contexts, it generally overlaps one or more of the following: science fiction, [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]], [[supernatural fiction]], [[superhero fiction]], [[utopian and dystopian fiction]], [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]], and [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]].

* [[Slipstream (genre)|Slipstream]]: Fantastic or non-realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries between science fiction/[[fantasy]] and [[mainstream]] [[literary fiction]]. The term ''slipstream'' was coined by [[cyberpunk]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] in an article originally published in ''SF Eye #5'', July 1989. He wrote: ''"...this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel very strange; the way that living in the 20th century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility."'' Slipstream fiction has consequently been referred to as "the fiction of strangeness," which is as clear a definition as any others in wide use.
* [[Supernatural fiction]]: exploits or requires as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace [[Natural environment|natural world]] and [[materialist]] assumptions about it. It includes the traditional [[ghost story]]. ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' by [[Henry James]] is an example of a work of [[literary fiction]] that is also largely concerned with supernatural fiction elements, making play of the possibility that they are psychological at root, but requiring the option that they are not for effect. The newer [[speculative fiction]] genres of [[horror fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]], growing out of some of the basic propositions and [[generic convention]]s, to a certain extent replaced it.
* [[Superhero fiction]]: deals with [[superhero]]es, [[supervillain]]s, super-powered humans, [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]], or [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]], and their adventures.  Distinct from (but often derived from) [[comic book]]s, [[animation|animated films]], and [[graphic novels]], these are prose stories and full-length [[novel]]s.  Superhero fiction is a type of [[speculative fiction]].  The largest and longest running of the corporate series are those associated with the [[DC Universe]] and the [[Marvel Universe]].
* [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]: The  utopia  and its offshoot, the  dystopia, are  genres of literature  that explore social and political structures.  Utopian fiction  is the creation of an ideal world, or [[utopia]], as the setting for a novel.  Dystopian fiction  is the opposite: creation of a [[nightmare]] world, or [[dystopia]]. Many novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in [[science fiction]] and other [[speculative fiction]] genres, and arguably are by definition a type of [[speculative fiction]]. More than 400 utopian works were published prior to the year 1900 in the [[English language]] alone, with more than a thousand others during the 20th century.
* [[Weird fiction]]: [[Speculative literature]] written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Weird fiction is distinguished from [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] in that it predates the [[niche marketing]] of [[genre fiction]]. Because genre or stylistic conventions had not been established, weird tales often blend the supernatural, mythical, and even scientific. British "weird" authors, for example, published their work in mainstream literary magazines even after American pulp magazines became popular. "Weird fiction" is chiefly a historical description for works through the 1930s, but the term has also been used since the 1980s, sometimes to refer to [[slipstream (genre)|slipstream]] fiction that blends horror, fantasy, and science fiction.

Suppositional fiction is a subcategory in which stories and characters are constrained within an internally consistent world, but this category is not necessarily associated with any particular genre.&lt;ref&gt;Izenberg, Orin. ''Being Numerous: Poetry and the Ground of Social Life. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011; p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Thomas M. ''What Stories Are: Narrative Theory and Interpretation'' University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986; p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Domańska, Ewa. ''Encounters: Philosophy of History After Postmodernism'' Charlottesville, Virginia: University Press of Virginia, 1998; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; A work of suppositional fiction might be science fiction, alternate history, mystery, horror, or even suppositional fantasy, depending on the intent and focus of the author.

===Thriller===
[[File:RebeccaTrailer.jpg|thumb|200px|A common theme in thrillers involves innocent victims dealing with deranged adversaries, as seen in Hitchcock's film ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), where Mrs. Danvers tries to persuade Mrs. De Winter to leap to her death]]
A [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]] is a story that is usually a mix of fear and excitement. It has traits from the [[suspense]] genre and often from the [[Action (fiction)|action]], [[adventure]] or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] genres, but the level of terror makes it borderline [[horror fiction]] at times as well. It generally has a dark or serious theme, which also makes it similar to [[drama]].

* [[Disaster]]-thriller: A story about mass peril, where the protagonist's job is to both survive, and to save many other people from a grim fate, often a [[natural disaster]] such as a storm or volcanic eruption, but may also be a [[terrorist]] attack or [[epidemic]] of some sort.
* [[Psychological thriller]]: emphasizes the psychological condition of the hero that presents obstacles to his objective, rather than the action. Some psychological thrillers are also about complicated stories that try to deliberately confuse the audience, often by showing them only the same confusing or seemingly nonsensical information that the hero gains.
* [[crime|Crime thriller]]: A story that revolves around the life of detectives, mobs, or other groups associated with criminal events in the story.
* [[Techno-thriller]]: A story whose theme is usually technology, or the danger behind the technology people use, including the threat of [[cyber terrorism]] such as ''[[State of Fear]]''.

===Urban===
[[Urban fiction]], also known as '''street lit''', is a [[literary genre]] set, as the name implies, in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the race and culture of its characters as the [[Urban area|urban]] setting.  The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside. Profanity (all of [[George Carlin]]'s [[seven dirty words]] and urban variations thereof), sex and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material.  In this respect, urban fiction shares some common threads with [[dystopian]] or [[survivalist]] fiction. In the second wave of urban fiction, some variations of this model have been seen.

===Western===
Stories in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre are set in the [[American Old West|American West]], between the time of the Civil war and the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of a wilderness or uncivilized area is especially important to the genre, and the setting is often described richly and in-depth. They focus on the adventure of the main character(s) and the contrast between civilization or society and the untamed wilderness, often featuring the characters working to bring civilization to the wilderness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre periodically overlaps with historical fiction, and while a more traditional definition of westerns is that of stories about lone men facing the frontier, more modern definitions and writings are often expanded to include any person or persons in this time period that feature a strong tone of the contrast between civilization and wilderness and emphasize the independence of the main character(s).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Film and television formats and genres==
{{See also|Film genre}}
Genres are listed under the sub-sectioned formats:

===Animation===
{{See also|Animation}}

* [[Traditional animation]]: also known as "cel (short for celluloid) animation", this is one of the oldest animation subgenres. Basically, it is a way of animating a [[cartoon]] by drawing and painting pictures by hand. Each drawing or painting is a different frame of animation, and when they are flipped or put in sequence at the right speed, they give the illusion of movement. Examples are ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''.
* [[Animated series]]: created or adapted with a common series title, usually related to one another and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed time slot. Animated cartoon series also approved ly outside broadcast television, as was the case for the ''Tom and Jerry'' short films that appeared in movie theaters from 1961 to 1962. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes.
* [[Stop motion]]: similar to traditional animation; instead of using hand drawn pictures, stop motion films are made with small figurines or other objects that have their picture taken many times over a sequence of small movements to create animation frames. Examples are ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', ''[[Coraline]]'', and ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.
* [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI): A genre of animation that includes animating a cartoon on a computer modeling program. Models of characters or props are created on the computer, and then programmed to do something specific. Then, when the animation is completely programmed, the computer can play a completely computer generated movie. CGI is often used for the visual effects in Live Action films as well. Examples are ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' or ''[[Toy Story]]''.
* [[Puppetry]]: It is technically live action, but puppetry is a different way of "animating" a movie, and puppets are often used in lieu of live actors. Usually, there are small figurines or figures (similar to stop motion), but these are controlled and filmed in real time. Like CGI, puppetry can be found in live-action films as a method of achieving a special effect. Examples are ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''.

===Live-action scripted===
* [[Dramatic television series|Drama]]:
** [[Adult content]]: the portrayal of sexual or sensual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. A distinction is also made between [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] and [[hardcore pornography]]. Softcore pornography can generally be described as focusing on nude modeling or suggestive, but not explicit, simulations of sexual activity, whereas hardcore pornography explicitly showcases [[Sexual penetration|penetrative intercourse]] or other sex acts.
** [[Quality television|Art television]] (also called "quality television"): shares some of the same traits of [[art film]]s. [[Television show]]s such as [[David Lynch]]'s  ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' series and [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Singing Detective]]'' also have "...a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity."
** [[Action film|Action]]: where one or more heroes are thrust into a series of challenges that typically include physical feats, extended combat scenes, violence and frenetic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful character struggling against incredible odds, including life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit, which generally conclude in victory for the hero.
** [[Adventure film|Adventure]]: features the hero in action scenes that display and explore exotic locations. The subgenres of adventure films include swashbuckler film, disaster films, and historical dramas—which is similar to the epic film genre. Main plot elements include quests for lost continents, a jungle or desert settings, characters going on a treasure hunts and heroic journeys into the unknown. Adventure films are mostly set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen in adventure films. Adventure films may also be combined with other movie genres such as, science fiction, fantasy and sometimes war films.
** [[Courtroom drama]]: presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc.
** [[Detective fiction]]: a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective&amp;nbsp;– either professional or amateur&amp;nbsp;– investigates a crime, often murder.
** [[Docudrama]]: A program depicting some sort of historical or current news event, with specific changes or fabrications for legal, continuity or entertainment reasons. Depending on the quality of the feature and intended audience, these changes can minimally or completely change the story in relation to the actual events. These programs often depict crime or criminals but can also be used to depict heroics or tell a less-explored side of a well-known story. Example: ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' by Paul Greengrass depicts the events aboard [[United Airlines Flight 93]] on September 11, 2001 via reconstruction from the available evidence. Since the specific words the passengers exchanged while planning their assault on the cockpit will never be known, the filmmakers created the dialogue based on research and evidence. [[The Onion Field]] is another example. This genre is often criticized for creating sensationalized programs intended to capitalize on public interest in lurid news stories; in the case of the [[Scott Peterson]] murder trial, a [[The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story|docudrama]] starring [[Dean Cain]] was filmed and aired during jury deliberations.
** [[Fantasy television|Fantasy]]: featuring elements of the fantastic, often including magic, supernatural forces, or exotic fantasy worlds. Fantasy television programs are often based on tales from mythology and folklore, or are adapted from fantasy stories in other media. The boundaries of fantasy television overlap with science fiction and horror.
** [[Horror film|Horror]] is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears. Horror films often feature scenes that startle the viewer; the macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres.
** [[Legal drama]]: Legal drama sometimes overlap with crime drama, most notably in the case of the show ''Law &amp; Order''.
** [[Medical drama]]: based around a team of medics helping patients who have been involved in accidents serious or otherwise. Most commonly, an accident occurs that requires the medics to help the injured. Most are usually based around a hospital, with some based around a mobile medical team etc. Examples of this genre are [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], [[Holby City]] and [[ER (TV series)|ER]].
** [[Police procedural]]: pioneered by the popular show ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. The stories revolve around a crime that has been committed and must be solved by the end of the episode following a very generic and usually unchanging structure of events. The crime is committed, witnesses are questioned, an arrest occurs, and then a judicial conclusion wraps it up. As the name implies, the show communicates everything "by the book," as it would happen in real life. In such modern police procedurals, such as [[Law &amp; Order]], you see and hear even the officers reading freshly arrested criminals their [[Miranda rights]]. Not quite as dramatic or action-oriented as the [[Dick Tracy]]-style of detective shows.
***Philosophical and psychological drama (PPP): A genre of film that's primary focus is crime drama, told from the angle of different psychological conditions, that debates philosophies and psychology of the era depicted in film. Examples are ''[[True Detective]]'' and ''[[Mindhunters]]''.
** [[Political drama]] is a [[TV program]] that has a [[politics|political]] component, whether reflecting the author's political opinion, or describing a [[politician]] or series of political events. [[Dramatist]]s who have written political dramas include [[Aaron Sorkin]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Caryl Churchill]], and [[Federico García Lorca]]. [[Television series]] that can be classified as political drama include ''[[Yes Minister]]'', its sequel ''[[Yes, Prime Minister]]'', ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]'', ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]'', ''[[Jack and Bobby]]'', ''[[The Bold Ones: The Senator]]'', ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'', and ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.
** [[Science-fiction]]
** [[Teen drama]]
** [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]
** [[Western (genre)|Western series]]: set in the American West and embody the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the new frontier. Western series use stock characters such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival, and ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.
* [[Television comedy|Comedy]]:
** [[Action comedy]]: A subgenre of [[comedy]] that emphasizes physically humorous antics, unorthodox body-language and oftentimes exasperating situations. Examples are: [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Jackie Chan]], and [[Lucille Ball]].
** [[Comedy-drama]]
** [[Mockumentary]]: A story that employs the style of the documentary to present fictional, and generally humorous, events or characters. Very common in film and [[television program]]s, both as a full film or series, or as a brief sequence or episode within a larger work. Examples include ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best In Show]]''.
** [[Romantic comedy]] (aka Rom-com)
** [[Satire]]
** [[Slapstick]]: A type of comedy involving exaggerated physical violence and activities beyond the boundaries of common sense. These [[hyperbole|hyperbolic]] depictions are often found in children's media, and light comedies.
** [[Sitcom]]: Short for ''situational comedy'', a generally lighthearted genre that features characters having to deal with odd or uncomfortable situations or misunderstandings.
** [[Sketch comedy]]

===Live-action unscripted===
* [[Documentary film|Documentary]]: a feature-length or near-feature-length film depicting a real-world event or person, told in a journalistic style (if told in a literary narrative style the result is often a docudrama). Examples: ''[[Hoop Dreams]]'', [[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|''The Thin Blue Line'' (documentary)]].
* [[Dramality]]: a combination of [[television drama]] and [[reality television]] genres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/dramality.asp |title=Dramality | work=Word Spy | accessdate=November 30, 2011 | author=McFedries, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/open-dictionary/entries/dramality.htm |title=Definition of dramality| work=MacMillan Dictionary | accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Only Way Is Essex]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/in-the-mix/2011/06/13/auditions-for-only-way-is-essex-type-dramality-show-to-be-filmed-in-liverpool-100252-28867283/| title=Auditions for Only Way Is Essex-type dramality show filmed in Liverpool |work=[[Liverpool Echo]] | accessdate=November 30, 2011 |date=June 13, 2011 |author=Siddle, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* [[Educational television|Educational]]: helps kids learn their basics to go through school.
* [[Factual television]]: non-fiction television programming that documents actual events and people. These type of programs are also described as documentary, [[television documentary]], observational documentary, fly on the wall, docudrama, and reality television. The genre has existed in various forms since the early years of television, but the term ''factual television'' has most commonly described programs produced since the 1990s.
* [[Game show]]: depicting a real [[Competition|contest]], typically a [[trivia]] competition or physical challenge, with rewards in prizes or money. The players may include celebrities, who can be found on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Hollywood Game Night]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Name Game]]''. More often the participants are ordinary "everyday" people, such as ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.
* [[Instructional television|Instructional]]: the use of television programs in the field of distance education. Educational television programs on instructional television may be less than one half hour long (generally 15 minutes in length) to help their integration into the classroom setting. These shows are often accompanied by teachers' guides that include material to help use this program in lessons. Instructional television programs are often shown during the daytime on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations in the United States. However, fewer public television stations devote their airtime to ITV today than they do in the past; these days, ITV programs are either seen on a digital subchannel of Non-commercial educational public television station, or passed on to a local educational-access television channel run by a Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV organization.
* [[Music television]]: where viewers listen to music on the television similar to a radio station apart from commonly having a visual or complete [[music video]].
* [[News program]]: depicting real, up-to-date events
** [[Current affairs (news format)|Current affairs]]: [[Broadcast journalism]] where the emphasis is on detailed analysis and discussion of a [[news story]].
** Entertainment news: Form of [[entertainment journalism]]. Entertainment news programs focus on news involving the entertainment industry, including the world of [[film]], [[television]], and [[music]].
** [[Tabloid television]]: (also known as Teletabloid) a form of tabloid journalism. Tabloid television newscasts usually incorporate flashy graphics and sensationalized stories.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Often, there is a heavy emphasis on crime, stories with good video, and celebrity news. It is a form of "infotainment."
* [[Public affairs (broadcasting)]]: This refers to radio or television programs that focus on politics and public policy. Among commercial broadcasters, such programs are often only to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulatory expectations and are not scheduled in prime time. Public affairs television programs are usually broadcast at times when few listeners or viewers are tuned in (or even awake) in the US, in time slots known as graveyard slots; such programs can be frequently encountered at times such as 5–6&amp;nbsp;a.m. on a Sunday morning.
* [[Religious broadcasting|Religious]]: produced by religious organizations, usually with a religious message. It can include church services, talk/variety shows, and dramatic movies. Within the last two decades, most religious programming is found on religious television networks.
* [[Reality television|Reality]]: A purportedly unscripted show (though evidence suggests that some scripting or manipulation occurs) featuring non-actors interacting with each other or dealing with invented or contrived challenges, such as competing against others for a prize. Produced in a similar fashion as the [[documentary film]] genre, but with more emphasis on the showing of interpersonal conflict, emotional reactions, or unusual occurrences. The genre has numerous widely varying subgenres (see main article).
* [[Stand-up comedy]]: A style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy the comedian usually recites a fast-paced succession of humorous stories, short jokes called "bits", and one-liners, which constitute what is typically called a monologue, routine or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars, neo-burlesques, colleges, and theaters. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, and the internet.
* [[Sports television|Sports]]: The coverage of sports as a television program, on radio and other broadcasting media. It usually involves one or more sports commentators describing the events as they happen, which is called "colour commentary."
* [[Talk show]]: A television show in which one person (or a group of people) discuss various topics put forth by a [[List of talk show hosts|talk show host]]. Usually, guests on a talk show consist of a group of people who are learned or who have great experience in relation to whatever issue is being discussed on the show for that particular episode.
** [[Tabloid talk show]]: A tabloid talk show is a subgenre of the talk show genre. On this type of talk show, the host invites either a guest or a group of guests to discuss provocative topics. Such topics can range from marital infidelity to more outlandish topics. Additionally, the guests are encouraged to make public confessions, and even resolve their issues via on-camera "group therapy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hundley|first=Wendy|title=Baring All On a Talk Show is No Way to Solve Problems|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/features/9501050061_1_gordon-elliott-show-talk-audience|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=January 5, 1995|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Television documentary]]: A genre of television programming that broadcasts documentaries.
* [[Variety show]]: Also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, this is an entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling and ventriloquism. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days into the 1970s, and lasted into the 1980s. In several parts of the world, variety TV remains popular and widespread.
* [[Anthology series]]: presents a different story and a different set of characters in each episode. These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some anthology series, such as Studio One, began on radio and then expanded to television.
* [[Children's television series|Children's series]]: Aimed at children and families.
* [[Cooking show]]: A television program that presents food presentation in a [[kitchen]] [[television studio]]. Over the course of the program, the show's host, who is usually a [[celebrity chef]], prepares one or more dishes over the course of the episode. The chef takes the viewing audience through the food's inspiration, preparation, and stages of cooking.
* [[Court show]]: A court show is a television programming subgenre of either [[legal drama]]s or [[reality legal programming]]. Court shows present content mainly in the form of legal hearings between [[plaintiff]]s and [[defendants]], which are presided over by a pseudo-judge. Court shows first arose in the United States, and are still predominantly found in the country today.
* [[Infomercial]]s: Also known as Direct Response TV (DRTV), these are television commercials that generally include a phone number or website. Long-form infomercials are typically between 15 and 30 minutes long, and short-form infomercials are typically 30 seconds to 120 seconds long. Infomercials are also known as paid programming (or teleshopping in Europe). This phenomenon started in the United States where infomercials were typically shown overnight (usually 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.), outside of prime time commercial broadcasting peak hours. Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off.

===Other television-related topics===
* [[Specialty channel]]s are commercial broadcasting or non-commercial television channel that focus on a single genre, subject, or targeted television market at a specific demographic. The number of specialty channels has increased during the 1990s and 2000s while the previously common concept of countries having just a few (national) TV stations addressing all interest groups and demographics became increasingly outmoded, as it already had been for some time in several countries. About 65% of today's satellite channels are specialty channels.

==Video game genres==
{{Main|Video game genre||List of video game genres}}

Genres in video games are somewhat different from other forms of art as most video game genres are based on the way in which the player interacts with the game. All genres from all other types of media can be applied to video games but are secondary to the genre types described below.

Genres unique to video games:

* Arcade games:
** Classic/Vintage: Games that require the player to navigate a maze or other obstacle.
* [[Shooter game|Shooter]]: Where the main purpose is to fight using guns.
** [[First-person shooter]] (FPS): A variant of the shooting game. In the game, the camera is actually in place of the character's eyes, so that you are playing the game from the character's view, looking down the barrel of a gun.
*** [[Massively multiplayer online first-person shooters|Massively multiplayer online First-person shooter]] (MMOFPS): An online gaming genre set in a persistent world with a large number of simultaneous players in a first-person shooter fashion. These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat.
** [[Third-person shooter]]: A shooting game where the camera angle is actually hovering over the playable character as you play.
* [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]: Where the purpose is to strategize. You have an opponent with the same abilities as you, more or less, and to beat him, you must use your abilities in a much more tactical way.
** [[Real-time strategy]] (RTS): Where everybody plays at the same time, and races to think of a better strategy than the other players. Most of these video games are about military.
*** [[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy]] (MMORTS): A Real Time Strategy game that is played online. Many players can sign on a play at the same time, creating empires and battling each other.
** [[Turn-based strategy]]: Where everybody takes turns. Once everybody has placed their units and military characters in the right spot they can't move again until the next turn begins. This structure is prominently used in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].
** [[Tower defense]]: Where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
* [[Music video game|Musical]]: Where music is usually played. To win, the players must match the rhythm of the music by pushing the right button combination until their opponents are unable to keep up with them. Not to be confused with the [[stage musical]] or [[musical film]], which are stories that feature characters singing about the events in the plot.
* [[Simulation game|Simulation]]: Where you must manage and develop fictitious business. For example, in a game you might be asked to manage and build a zoo, and the game simulates this for you in as accurate a way as possible.
** Simulation shooter: Features the basic mechanics of a shooter, where using a gun is the primary method of gameplay, but emphasizes realism, often incorporating features like ballistics and realistic character damage.
** Simulation strategy: A strategy game that emphasizes realism, such as the [[Total War (series)|Total War]] series of games, usually focusing on a specific time and location in human history, such as the [[Roman Empire]].
* [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]: Where you must solve puzzles to progress through the levels.
* [[Party game|Party]]: Mostly suitable for multiple players and social gatherings. In most of these, the player or players compete or cooperate in smaller games, or [[minigame]]s, within the main game.
* [[Platform game|Platform]]: Where the player must jump onto various platforms to evade obstacles and reach their goal, these games are fairly linear most of the time with levels adhering to a simple A to B structure.
* [[Fighting game|Fighting]]: Where two or more playable characters fight. Each character usually has their own unique moves, and the goal of the game, usually, is to be the last man standing.
* [[Racing video game|Racing game]]: Either in the first-person or third-person perspective, in which the player partakes in a racing competition with any type of land, air, or sea vehicles. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations, and simpler arcade racing games. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports games.
* [[Role-playing game (video games)|Role-playing game]] (RPG): A game that is not (necessarily) about combat. It is a game where the player plays a character, and goes around pretending to be a real person in a fictitious world. This is also similar to non-video game forms of gaming that involve roleplaying, including [[play by post gaming]] and [[tabletop roleplaying game]]s.
** [[Massive multiplayer online role playing game]] (MMORPG): Similar to a regular Role Playing Game, but it is a multiplayer game played via the [[internet]]. During this game, thousands of players from around the world can play the same game at the same time and chat with each other. Players sign onto the game and complete quests while exploring the virtual world. Many MMORPGs are free to play by just signing up on the specific game site and downloading the game file but some require a monthly fee.
* Sports games: Games that simulate playing real-life sports.
* [[Survival Horror|Survival/horror]]: The player is placed in a horrifying situation of which they must escape. The major emphasis of most survival horror games is placed upon tension and a truly terrifying or grisly scenario. Puzzle-solving is a major characteristic of the genre. Examples of survival horror games include the ''Resident Evil'', ''Silent Hill'' and ''Clock Tower'' series.
* [[Stealth game|Stealth]]: The player must proceed through an environment or complete an objective without being seen.

==Music genres==
{{Main|Music genre|List of music styles}}

* [[Film score]]: is music produced specifically to accommodate a film. 
* [[Gospel music]]: is a music genre in [[Christian music]].
* [[Medieval music]]: Music composed from around the middle of the 5th century to the middle of the 15th century, largely characterized by monophonic and polyphonic music.
* [[Renaissance music]]: largely composed from the middle of the 15th century to around 1600.
* [[Baroque music]]: composed from around 1600 to the middle of the 18th century. Much Baroque music is written in the form of dance suites.
* [[Classical music|Classical]]: Music that was composed from around the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century. The key musical forms were the symphony, the concerto, and the sonata. Also includes some more recently written music ([[Neo-classical music|Neo-classical]]) that contains many of the same musical elements.
* [[Romantic music|Romantic]]: composed from the early 19th century to about 1900, which emphasized dramatic themes and subject matter. Also includes more recently written music ([[Neo-romanticism (music)|Neo-romantic]]) that contains similar musical elements.
* [[20th-century music]]: A wide classification of music composed in the 20th century. This music deals largely with sound experimentation and moving away from the traditional tendencies of tonality.
* [[Opera]], [[Operette]] and [[Zarzuela]]
* [[Folk music|Folk]]: adaptations of old stories that were passed from generation to generation. Considered somewhat more niche now. Also see [[Neofolk]], [[Neofolk|Folk Noir]], [[Neofolk|Pagan Folk]].
* [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]]: is a form of [[American roots music]], with roots in the English, Irish, and Scottish traditional music, a notable [[blues]] and [[jazz]] influence and a high lonesome sound, being later influenced by the music of African-Americans. Unlike country music, bluegrass is mostly accompanied by acoustic [[stringed instruments]].
* [[Country music]]: American popular music that began in the rural regions of the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from southeastern American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas.
The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.
* [[Rock music|Rock]]: originated from folk and blues. It used newer electrical instruments instead of relying solely on the classical woodwinds and stringed instruments. It first became popular in the mid-20th century because of famous bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].
** [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]]: Similar to rock, and generally considered a subgenre of it. It usually uses the same electrical instruments, but the music is more intense and less "pop" in style (see below) such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Metallica]].
** [[Punk rock]]: developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Includes work by [[The Adverts]], the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]].
* [[Pop music|Pop]]: once referred to any popular music during the time period, though the term has slowly gained use as a more specific (yet still somewhat vague) genre descriptor for music with a catchy, relatively consistent melody, among other aspects. It is commonly placed as having started in the mid-20th century, alongside rock music. Much [[dance music]] falls under this genre, and much modern rock music is considered to include elements of it as well, since bands such as the Beatles were a significant stylistic influence on what is now considered pop.
* [[Rhythm and blues]] (R&amp;B): an evolving range of [[Music genre|genres]] of [[Popular music|popular]] [[African-American music]] that first began to develop in the early 20th century.
** [[Blues]]: A somewhat somber, quieter style of music whose name refers to the unhappiness of the performer. These became popular in the early 20th century alongside [[jazz]], and influenced the early development of rock music. A major genre within R&amp;B, and one of its earliest genres as well.
** [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]: more [[rhythm]]ically based, mostly African-American urban-derived genres, with a wide array of subgenres between them.
** [[Funk]]: A intense [[Groove (music)|groovy]] style of music popular in the mid 20th century that contributed to the development of disco. 
** [[Jazz]]: originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. Jazz has, from its early 20th-century inception, spawned a variety of subgenres, from New Orleans Dixieland dating from the early 1910s, big band-style swing from the 1930s and 1940s, bebop from the mid-1940s, a variety of Latin jazz fusions such as Afro-Cuban and Brazilian jazz from the 1950s and 1960s, jazz-rock fusion from the 1970s and late 1980s developments such as acid jazz, which blended jazz influences into funk and hip-hop.
* [[Electronic music]]: employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production. It consists of a number of separate genres, many of which are still evolving. One major category within this form of music is electronic dance music (EDM), with its own multitude of genres and subgenres, which is primarily associated with the dance and club scene.
** [[Breakbeat]]: usually characterized by the use of a {{clarify span|non-straightened|date=February 2013}} 4/4 drum pattern (as opposed to the steady beat of [[house music|house]] or [[trance music|trance]]). Includes work by [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Davy DMX]], [[Music Instructor]] and [[Bomfunk MC's]].
** [[Drum and Bass]] or [[Drum and Bass|Jungle]]: emerged in the late 1980s and is characterized by fast [[Breakbeat|breaks]] and [[basslines]]. Includes work by [[Roni Size]], [[Chase &amp; Status]] and [[London Elektricity]].
** [[Ambient music|Ambient]]: focuses on the timbral characteristics of sounds, particularly organised or performed to evoke an "atmospheric", "visual" or "unobtrusive" quality.
** [[Downtempo]]: a laid-back style similar to [[ambient music]], but usually with a beat or groove unlike the beatless forms of Ambient music.
** [[Electro music|Electro]]: directly influenced by the use of [[TR-808]] and [[funk]] records. Includes work by [[Kraftwerk]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] and [[Jerry Calliste Jr.|Hashim]].
** [[House music|House]]: originated in Chicago, Illinois, US in the late 1970s and early 1980s; includes work by [[Fedde Le Grand]] and [[Frankie Knuckles]].
** [[Synthwave]]: influenced by 1980s film soundtracks and video games, using basslines and leads from an [[analog synthesizer]]. It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture and its advancement towards the future, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it. Includes work by [[Kavinsky]], [[Electric Youth (band)|Electric Youth]] and [[Power Glove (band)|Power Glove]].
** [[Trance music|Trance]]: generally characterized by a [[tempo]] of between approximately 128 and 150&amp;nbsp;BPM, melodic [[synthesizer]] phrases, and a musical form that is progressive as it builds up and down throughout a track. Includes work by [[Darude]], [[ATB]] and [[Chicane]].
** [[Techno]]: emerged in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], US during the mid-to-late 1980s. Includes work by [[Tomcraft]], [[Leftfield]] and [[Moby]].
** [[UK Garage]]: generally connected to the evolution of [[house music|house]] in the United Kingdom from early/mid-1990s. Includes work by [[T2 (band)|T2]], [[Artful Dodger (UK band)|The Artful Dodger]] and [[Shanks &amp; Bigfoot]].
* [[Reggae]]: first developed in Jamaica in the late 1960s. While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term ''reggae'' more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]]. Reggae is based on a rhythmic style characterized by accents on the off-beat, known as the skank. Reggae is normally slower than ska. Reggae usually accents the second and fourth beat in each bar. Reggae song lyrics deal with many subjects, including religion, love, sexuality, peace, relationships, drugs, poverty, injustice and other social and political issues.
* [[Calypso music|Calypso]]: developed in the mid-20th century out of [[Kaiso]] music. The genre became a worldwide hit in the 1950s when the 1956 album titled [[Calypso (album)|Calypso]] was the first full-length record to sell more than a million copies.
* [[Merengue music|Merengue]]: first developed in the Dominican Republic in the mid-19th century and has become very popular since then. The style of the genre uses the [[accordion]] usually as the lead instrument, the [[guitar]] and/or [[saxophone]] as the melody, [[tambora (drum)|tambora]] and [[güira]] percussion instruments and at intivals the [[marimba]] usually joining the combination.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">"'''Lobachevsky'''" is a humorous song by [[Tom Lehrer]], referring to the mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.revisited.html#6 |title=Lobachevsky |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lehrer, the song is "not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character" and the name was chosen "solely for [[prosodic]] reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, "The Tom Lehrer Collection", ''Shout!'' Factory, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt;

In the introduction, Lehrer describes the song as an adaptation of a routine that [[Danny Kaye]] did to honor the Russian actor [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; (The Danny Kaye routine is sung from the perspective of a famous Russian actor who learns and applies Stanislavski's secret to method acting: "Suffer.") &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXI2djKeerQ The Stanislavski routine] performed on the Danny Kaye Radio Show &lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer sings the song from the point of a view of a preeminent Russian mathematician who learns, from Lobachevsky, that [[plagiarism]] is the secret of success in mathematics (though adding "only be sure always to call it please '[[research]]'"). The narrator later uses this strategy to get a paper published ahead of a rival, then to write a book and earn a fortune selling the movie rights.

Lehrer wrote that he did not know [[Russian language|Russian]]. In the song he quotes two book reviews in Russian; the first is a long sentence that he then translates succinctly as "It stinks". The second, a different but equally long sentence, is also translated as "It stinks." The actual text of these sentences bear no relation to academics: the first phrase quotes [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''Song of the Flea'': "Once there was a king who had a pet flea." The second references a Russian joke: "Now I must go where even the Tsar goes on foot" [the bathroom].&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"&gt;{{cite web |title="Lobachevsky" Words and music by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/lobachevsky.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was first performed as part of ''The Physical Revue,'' a 1951–1952 musical [[revue]] by Lehrer and a few other professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Physical Revue, by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/astronomy/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is track 6 on ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'', which was re-released as part of ''[[Songs &amp; More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' and ''[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]]''. In this early version, [[Ingrid Bergman]] is named to star in the role of "[[Hypotenuse]]" in ''The Eternal Triangle'', a film purportedly based on the narrator's book.&lt;ref name="Calder2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel Calder|title=Magic Universe: A Grand Tour of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4NfZ9FDcc8C&amp;pg=PT639 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-162235-9|page=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded again for ''[[Revisited (Tom Lehrer album)]]'', with [[Brigitte Bardot]] as Hypotenuse. A third recording is included in ''[[Tom Lehrer Discovers Australia (And Vice Versa)]]'', a live album recorded in Australia, featuring [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Hypotenuse. A fourth recording was made in 1966 when ''Songs by Tom Lehrer'' was reissued in stereo, with [[Doris Day]] playing Hypotenuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.diff.html |title=Tom Lehrer lyric variations |date=April 2, 1995 |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"/&gt;

The song is frequently quoted,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Quotations|editor-first=Susan|editor-last=Ratcliffe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780198614173|page=692|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLDEH2TAvwUC&amp;pg=PT692}}.

[[File:Federico Barocci - La Madonna del Gatto.jpg|thumb|''Madonna del Gatto'']]
The painting titled '''''Madonna of the Cat''''' or '''''Madonna del gatto''''' was painted in 1575 by  [[Federico Barocci]]. It is presently in the  [[National Gallery|National Gallery of London]].

==History and Description==
The painting was made for Count Antonio Brancaleoni of [[Perugia]]. Engravings of the painting appeared by 1577. 

The Holy Family, consisting of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], Mary, a young [[John the Baptist]], and a lactating infant Jesus, are portrayed in a domestic moment. John appears to be teasing the cat with a captured goldfinch, an allegoric symbol of Christ's Passion. John's reed rests against a wall in the background. The main characters form a proto-[[Baroque art|Baroque]]-style diagonal to the right. In the style of Barocci, the cheeks are rosy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/federico-barocci-the-madonna-of-the-cat-la-madonna-del-gatto The Madonna of the Cat ('La Madonna del Gatto')], website of the National Gallery, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The product was featured on [[Morgan Spurlock]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[The Greatest Movie Ever Sold|POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'' as one of the corporate sponsors. Although featured heavily throughout the film, the end titles of the film point out that the company did not pay for the sponsorship deal. 

On the Mane 'n Tail website, management explains: "Mane 'n Tail is no stranger to doing product placement in major motion pictures, this however, was our first foray into the indie film arena as Morgan sought us out to participate in the film about product placement funded strictly by product placement. When we agreed to jump on board, we had no idea what an incredible opportunity it would blossom into. Sony Pictures Classics picked up the film three days before its Sundance premiere, much to everyone’s delight. The publicity has been unbelievable and our part in the movie... we absolutely adore. Although we are a 'sponsor', Mane 'n Tail did not pay to be part of the film, instead we exchanged our product, a true 'product placement' deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manentail.com/expert-blog/mane-%E2%80%98n-tail-goes-to-the-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mane 'n Tail Goes To The Sundance Film Festival |publisher=Mane 'n Tail |date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in Movies==
Mane 'n Tail has also had other motion pictures besides "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold".

'''Mongol zurag''' ({{lang-mn|Mонгол зураг}}, ''Mongol painting'') is a style of painting in [[Mongolia]]n art. Developed in the early 20th century, zurag is characterised by the depiction of secular, nationalist themes in a traditional mineral-paint–on–cotton medium similar to Tibetan ''[[thangka]]''. It is thus distinguished from both traditional [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] fine art and the [[socialist realism]] favoured during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

The style was pioneered in the aftermath of the [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|1921 Revolution]] by artists such as [[Balduugiin Sharav]], whose ''One Day in Mongolia'' remains one of the most celebrated works of Mongolian art. Zurag paintings featuring scenes from everyday life, in both contemporary [[collective farm]] and traditional [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomadic]] settings, became popular in the 1950s and 1960s in the wake of the success of [[Ürjingiin Yadamsüren]]'s ''The Old Fiddler''. Historical depictions of the 1921 Revolution as well as earlier national figures were also popular, but overtly religious themes were discouraged by the state. Since the [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|establishment of democracy in 1992]] there has been a resurgence of interest in the style. Recent zurag paintings have featured nationalistic scenes drawn from the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'' and the life of [[Genghis Khan]], as well overtly religious imagery inspired by pre-Buddhist [[Tengriism|shamanism]]. They have also become more symbolic and less strictly representational.

Throughout its history zurag has encompassed a diverse range of visual styles. Flat, brightly coloured shading in the Buddhist tradition is used alongside European-style [[Realist visual arts|realism]] and [[geometric perspective]]. Some zurag artists co-opted older Buddhist iconographic conventions for purely secular topics. 
[[Otgonbayar Ershuu]] is an important painter of our time, he was portrayed in the film "ZURAG" by Tobias Wulff.&lt;ref&gt;ZURAG – a movie about Otgonbayar Ershuu; Germany/Mongolia 2010; produced by Tobias Wulff [http://www.zurag.de/zurag-film.html (The movie was broadcast twice in the Mongolian State television in 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neo-Tiwanakan''' or Pseudo-Tiwanakan [[architecture]] is a style developed by the architect [[Emilio Villanueva|Emilio Villanueva Peñaranda]] between the years 1930 and 1948 inspired in the designs of the [[Pre-Columbian]] archeological site of [[Tiwanaku]] in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="SocArq"&gt;{{cite book |author=Browman, David   |title=La Sociedad arqueológica de Bolivia y su influencia en el desarrollo de la práctica arqueológica en Bolivia |trans-title=The archeological society of Bolivia and its influence in the development of the archeological practice in Bolivia |url=http://www.arqueobolivia.com/revistas/23_51_32-1222738970.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2010 |series=Nuevos Aportes |volume=4 |year=2007 |location=La Paz, Bolivia |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuiaLP"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pérez, Martín   |author2=Boero Rojo, Hugo |author3=de la Riva, Miroslava |editor=Unión  de Ciudades Capitales Iberoamericanas |title=Guía de La Paz |trans-title=La Paz guide |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D3e7AAAAIAAJ |series=Guías UCCI |volume=13 |year=1990 |publisher= |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-87771-02-6 |oclc=433846494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The architect Emilio Villanueva popularized the Neo-Tiwanakan architecture in the city of [[La Paz]] during the decade of the 1930s. The inspiration for these designs was the blueprints for ideal reconstructions of Tiwanaku elaborated by Edmund Kiss in 1937; these designs were adapted by Villanueva to give them an urban and contemporaneous style.&lt;ref name="SocArq" /&gt;

[[Image:NileMosaicOfPalestrina.jpg|thumb|250px|A detail of the mosaic.]]
[[Image:Mosaïque Praeneste.jpg|thumb|250px|Another detail (Altes Museum, Berlin).]]
The '''Palestrina Mosaic''' or '''Nile mosaic of Palestrina''' is a late [[Hellenistic]] floor [[mosaic]] depicting the [[Nile]] in its passage from the [[Blue Nile]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. The mosaic was part of a Classical sanctuary-grotto in [[Palestrina]], a town east of [[Ancient Rome]], in central Italy. It has a width of 5.85 metres and a height of 4.31 metres and provides a glimpse into the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fascination with [[ancient Egypt]]ian exoticism in the 1st century BC, both as an early manifestation of the role of [[Egypt in the European imagination|Egypt in the Roman imagination]]&lt;ref&gt;Another Nile floor mosaic, in the [[House of the Faun]], [[Pompeii]], is dated by Meyboom 1995, ca 90 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; and an example of the genre of "[[Nilotic landscape]]", with a long iconographic history in Egypt and the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]].

==Description==

The mosaic, with an arch-headed framing that identifies its original location as flooring an [[apse]] in a [[grotto]], features detailed depictions of [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Greeks, [[Aethiopia]]ns in hunting scenes, and various animals of the Nile river.&lt;ref&gt;A Nilotic monster was identified as a "dinosaur" on [http://www.s8int.com/dinolit2.html a website], giving rise to some hopeful Internet speculation on the coexistence of dinosaurs and humans.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest Roman depiction of Nilotic scenes, of which several more were uncovered at [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. P. Meyboom, ''The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina: Early Evidence of Egyptian Religion in Italy'', Brill 1995, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus on the dating of the work is slowly emerging. Paul G. P. Meyboom suggests a date shortly before the reign of Sulla (ca. 100 BC) and treats the mosaic as an early evidence for the spread of Egyptian cults in Italy, where [[Isis]] was syncretised with [[Fortuna]]. He believes Nilotic scenes were introduced in Rome by [[Demetrius the Topographer]], a Greek artist from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] active ca. 165 BC. Claire Préaux emphasises the "escapist" nature of the fantastic scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Préaux, "Graeco-Roman Egypt", in J.R. Harris, ed. ''The Legacy of Egypt'', 1971:340f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Nile Mosaic and its companion piece, the Fish Mosaic, were apparently still to be seen in the Italian city of [[Palestrina]], ancient Praeneste, in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia La Malfa, "Reassessing the Renaissance of the Palestrina Nile Mosaic" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''66''' (2003), pp. 267-272, notes the mosaic's appearance in a manuscript ''De antiquitati Latii'', a description of sites and antiquities in [[Lazio]], by Antonio Volsco, now in the [[British Library]] (Harley Ms 5050); the manuscript is dedicated to Gerolamo Basso Della Rovere, who died in 1507.&lt;/ref&gt; When first noticed shortly before 1507 by Antonio Volsco, a humanist in the circle of [[Pomponio Leto]], the mosaics were still ''in situ'' among the vestiges of [[Sulla]]'s sanctuary of [[Fortuna|Fortuna Primigenia]]. At that time the town was owned by the [[Colonna]] family of Rome, whose palazzo in Palestrina occupied a section of the ruins.

The mosaic may have been indicated in a well-known passage in [[Pliny's Natural History]] concerning mosaic floors in Italy:
{{bquote|Mosaics came into use as early as [[Sulla]]'s régime. At all events there exists even today one made of very small [[tessera]]e which he installed in the temple of Fortune at Palestrina.}}

Volsco added that these were "arranged in the pattern of a picture".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in La Malfa 2003:268.&lt;/ref&gt; Maurizio Calvesi, in identifying Francesco Colonna as the author of ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', identifies passages in ''Hypnerotomachia'' depending on Pliny that were enriched by direct experience of the mosaics themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvesi|title=Il sogno di Polifilo prenestino|location=Rome|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
In the 17th century, Palestrina passed to the [[Barberini family]], who between 1624 and 1626 removed most of the mosaic from its setting, without recording the overall composition, and, after further movements and damage, put it on exhibition in the [[Palestrina#Main sights|Palazzo Barberini in Palestrina]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;Meybloom, 1&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic was restored and repaired on numerous occasions, but careful watercolors of the sections were made for [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]] before the initial restoration in the ''opificio'' of St. Peter's. Helen Whitehouse's rediscovery of the long-lost watercolors enabled a reconstruction of the surviving segments in a more meaningful way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Helen|last=Whitehouse|title=The Dal Pozzo Copies of the Palestrina Mosaic|location=Oxford|journal=British Archaeological Reports|year=1976}}; Meybloom (p. 6) generally agrees with Whitehouse, except over the placing of one section.  Commons has a selection of images from the Dal Pozzo copies.&lt;/ref&gt; although much remains uncertain about the original composition. The mosaic has been a major feature of the ''Museo Nazionale Prenestino'' in Palazzo Barberini, Palestrina (not the one in Rome) since 1953

[[File:West Pole Reloaded (8477426439).jpg|thumb|right|200px|At this West Pole Reloaded concert, while the keyboard player and celletto player performed onstage, the musician triggering the electronic instruments was located offstage for the performance.]]

'''Offstage musicians and singers''' are performers who play instruments and/or sing backstage, out of sight of the audience, during a live [[popular music]] concert at which the main band is visible playing and singing onstage. The sound from the offstage musicians or singers is captured by a microphone or from the output of their instrument, and this signal is mixed in with the singing and playing of the onstage performers using an [[audio console]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]]. Offstage [[backup singer]]s are also used in some [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]]s, as have offstage instrumentalists, in cases where an onstage actor needs to appear to play an instrument.

The offstage musicians and singers are typically located beside the stage, behind the speaker stacks, backstage, under the stage (for raised stages), or, for [[music festival]]s held out of doors, in a tent near the backstage area.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/inside-the-strange-hidden-world-of-offstage-touring-musicians-6539027|title=Inside the Strange, Hidden World of Offstage Touring Musicians|last=Wake|first=Matt|date=1 February 2016|website=www.laweekly.com|publisher=LA Weekly |access-date=21 June 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Offstage performers may be called an "offstage touring guitarist", "offstage touring keyboard player", "offstage guitarist", "offstage keyboardist", "offstage backup singer" or "offstage harmony singer". In music theatre, singers may be called "pit singers" or "offstage voices". Slang terms are also used, such as "ghost singer".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/20/broadcasting.musicnews|title=Eurovision scandal: Scooch's winning sound augmented by ghost singers|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=20 March 2007|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=21 June 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
[[File:The 2008 cast of the off-Broadway musical Rock of Ages.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cast of the [[off-Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Rock of Ages (musical)|Rock of Ages]]''. The singer in the top right of the third (back) row, Tad Wilson, is an offstage singer and understudy ("cover") for one of the onstage singers, in the event of illness.]]
Some offstage performers are hired solely to play one or more instruments (e.g., synthesizer, rhythm guitar, percussion). Some offstage performers are hired solely to sing [[backup vocals]]. Some offstage performers are hired to play an instrument and sing backup or harmony vocals at the same time. Offstage musicians can be hired for one-off concerts, but they are generally hired for entire tours. Some offstage musicians or singers work with the same band for many years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

In Broadway musicals, some of the offstage singers may have a secondary role as [[understudy]] to one of the onstage singers; the understudy (also called the "cover", "standby" or "alternate") sings the part of the onstage actor in front of the audience, in costume, in the event that the main singer becomes ill.

Some offstage performers have another profession or role that they perform in addition. [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] offstage keyboardist Michael Kenney's other role is as the bassist's [[bass tech]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Acknowledgement==
Some offstage performers are asked to sign a [[nondisclosure agreement]] which forbids them from doing interviews regarding their offstage performance work for a certain group.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Sharon Osbourne]] states that [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s offstage singers and musicians are acknowledged in concert programs and, for concerts that are recorded, in the recording credits.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Alan Fitzgerald]] was the offstage keyboard player for [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[Devils &amp; Dust Tour]]. In the final two shows of the tour, Springsteen invited Fitzgerald up on stage, introduced him, and played with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstreets.com/setlists2005.html|title=2005 Setlists|publisher=Backstreets.com|date=|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alan Fitzgerald played off-stage keyboards for [[Van Halen]], he was credited as [[Eddie Van Halen]]'s "keyboard technician", a euphemism which acknowledged Fitzgerald's role as a keyboard player without admitting Fitzgerald was an offstage performer. Terry Lawless is credited in some sources as a keyboard technician and keyboard programmer for the band he works for.

==Approaches==
The instrumental playing by offstage performers is captured by a microphone for acoustic instruments such as acoustic guitar; by mic in front of the [[guitar amplifier]] and/or a [[DI unit]] output for an electric instrument such as [[electric bass]], by mic for [[electric guitar]] (in front of the [[guitar amp]]) and [[Hammond organ]] with a [[Leslie speaker]], or for an electronic instrument such as a [[synthesizer]], by getting the signal from the instrument's output. Singing is captured by a microphone. 

In all cases, the signal from the instruments and/or microphones are routed to the [[multicore cable]] (often nicknamed the "snake") and then plugged into the [[audio console|mixing board]]. Once the offstage musicians and singers' signals are plugged into the mixing board, the [[audio engineer]] can blend their sounds in with the playing and singing of the onstage musicians (which is also captured by microphones and/or signal cables). The mixed output is then routed to the [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]], the combination of [[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s which outputs the concert sounds for the audience.
===Pit orchestra===
A [[pit orchestra]] cannot be seen by all audience members. However, audience members in higher seats can see the pit musicians; as such, a typical pit orchestra in front of a stage cannot truly be considered to be hidden from the audiences' view. In some venues, there is no orchestra out in front of the stage; in this case, the pit orchestra may play in a room near the stage or backstage, watching the conductor's gestures using a video monitor.  While a pit orchestra that is located out of sight of the audience is technically an offstage ensemble, there is no intent on the part of the producers to deceive the audience.

==Challenges==
For offstage musicians and singers, playing and/or singing in tune and in time with the onstage performers can be challenging, since the offstage musicians are not in the same location as the onstage performers. To help the offstage musicians and singers play and sing in tune and in time, the offstage musicians are provided with [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] which reproduce the onstage playing and singing. As well, for offstage backup singers, they may be provided with a [[teleprompter]] video screen, which scrolls the lyrics down the screen. This helps the backup singer to remember the lyrics and the appropriate times to sing. A [[CCTV]] system may be set up, with cameras pointing at the stage, and TV monitors in the offstage performer area; this way, the offstage performers can see cues (head nods, hand signals) made by the lead singer or bandleader onstage. The offstage musician or singer may be given headphones with an intercom, to enable the audio engineer to communicate with the offstage performers. For offstage singers, a [[vocal booth]] may be set up to exclude outside sounds.

==Rationale==
There are many reasons that established bands and groups use offstage musicians and singers for concerts and concert tours. When heavy metal band [[KISS (band)|KISS]] hired an offstage keyboardist, it was to fill in the band's sound during the live concerts with backing chords and deep bass notes. However, one of the band members felt that only guitarists should be seen on stage, due to the group's reputation as a guitar-based heavy metal band.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In other cases, a group has been a trio or a quartet for decades, and the decision is made that having a touring keyboardist, rhythm guitarist or backup singer appear onstage could lead to speculation that the band may be adding a new member; to avoid rumours, the extra touring musician or singer is instructed to play or sing offstage. In some cases, the [[session musician]] who recorded an instrumental part on the album may not be available for an entire tour.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Having offstage musicians and/or singers enables a small group to produce a bigger, richer sound. As well, if the album that the group is promoting with the concert tour used extensive overdubs and extra musicians, playing the songs with just a trio or quartet might sound thin compared with the album. For example, with a [[power trio]], the electric guitar player can record several layers of guitar: [[riff]]s, [[chord (music)|chord]]s, [[fill (music)|fills]] and [[guitar solo]]s, giving the impression (on the album) that several guitar players are performing. If this same power trio were to play live without offstage musicians, the band's sound would not be able to match the instrumentation of the album. As such, the band may hire an offstage rhythm guitarist. 

For bands that have complex stage shows or choreographed dance routines, having offstage musicians and/or singers ensures that the playing and singing keeps going even if the onstage performers are momentarily distracted by doing dance moves or movements. In some cases, choreographed dance routines may require significant attention from the performer. If a guitarist is having to move in time with dancers, her or his attention from playing may be distracted. If the group has an offstage rhythm guitarist, then the rhythm guitar will continue even if the onstage performer stops for short periods.

Another reason for using offstage musicians is the increasingly complex recordings which are done in [[multitrack recording]] studio facilities. Unlike pre-multitrack days, when all the instrumentalists and singers would record the song in a single "take", with multitrack recording, the drums can be recorded one day, the bass guitar the next day, the rhythm guitar the next, [[backup vocalist]]s a week later and a [[string section]] a month later. The core band members can then overdub [[keyboard instrument]]s, [[lead vocals]], [[guitar solo]]s and other parts over a period of weeks or even months. The resulting recordings may feature a very large cast of instrumentalists and singers. Instead of bringing all of these extra musicians and singers onstage, some bands choose to have the extra musicians and backup singers perform offstage.

In the 2007 [[Eurovision]] Song Competition, the United Kingdom's entry, [[Scooch]], used "...extra [hidden] vocalists [to] hi[t] 'high harmon[y]" notes, with the extra singers hidden backstage.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/20/broadcasting.musicnews|title=Eurovision scandal: Scooch's winning sound augmented by ghost singers|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=20 March 2007|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=21 June 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
New Jersey's ''[[Upstage (magazine)|Upstage]]'' magazine liked [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[Devils &amp; Dust Tour]] show in general, but felt that the use of off-stage musicians was unsettling, saying "the idea of a solo acoustic tour loses something when it features other [offstage] musicians who are neither given credit for their work nor seen on stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstagemagazine.com/articles/getarticle-new.php?ID=1451|title=Review: Springsteen Acoustic 04/19 on UpstageMagazine.com|date=28 September 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=23 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082405/http://www.upstagemagazine.com/articles/getarticle-new.php?ID=1451|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2007 [[Eurovision]] scandal, viewers of the televised singing competition show and other competing groups were upset when they learned that the winning group, [[Scooch]], used "...extra [hidden] vocalists hitting 'high harmonies' backstage".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/20/broadcasting.musicnews|title=Eurovision scandal: Scooch's winning sound augmented by ghost singers|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=20 March 2007|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=21 June 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related approaches==
Some bands have an offstage sequencer-programmer who triggers basslines, beats, [[sampling (music)|digitally sampled sounds]] or [[backing tracks]]. Backing tracks can be as simple as a single prerecorded instrument, such as a recording of  a [[pipe organ]], which is impossible to move onstage, to [[string section]] recordings done in the studio, to full [[rhythm section]] recordings with bass, guitar, keyboards and drums. Some backing tracks also include [[backup vocals]]. An offstage technician or [[audio engineer]] triggers the sequencer, samples or backing tracks at the appropriate time. Some [[guitar technician]]s operate [[effects unit]]s from offstage or trigger samples for their guitarist. At some "...shows, an [audio] engineer at the side of the stage watches the show closely and starts the song in [[Ableton Live]] at the correct moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2000192/how-rock-concerts-work.html |title= How rock concerts work|last=Sullivan |first=Mark |date=3 July 2012 |website= www.pcworld.com/article|publisher= |access-date=24 June 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Parable of the Ten Virgins (section) by Phoebe Traquair, Mansfield Traquair Church, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|The Parable of the Ten Virgins (section) by [[Phoebe Traquair]], Mansfield Traquair Church, [[Edinburgh]].]]

The '''Parable of the Ten Virgins''', also known as the '''Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins''' or the '''Parable of the ten bridesmaids''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Bible]]: Matthew 25:1-13&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the well known [[parables of Jesus]]. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 25|25:1-13]], the five virgins who are prepared for the bridegroom's arrival are rewarded, while the five who are not prepared are [[disowned]]. The parable has a clear [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] theme: be prepared for the [[Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;John Barton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3surkLVdw3UC&amp;pg=PA878 The Oxford Bible Commentary]'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-875500-7}}, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most popular parables in the [[Middle Ages]], with enormous influence on [[Gothic art]], [[sculpture]] and the [[Sacred architecture|architecture]] of German and French [[cathedrals]].

==Narrative according to the [[Gospel of Matthew]]==
In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, [[Jesus]] tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids &lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; or torchbearers for a procession,&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; chosen to participate in a [[Jewish wedding|wedding]]. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or [[torch]]&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; as they await the coming of the [[bridegroom]], which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps.

At midnight, all the virgins hear the call to come out to meet the bridegroom. Realising their lamps have gone out, the foolish virgins ask the wise ones for oil, but they refuse, saying that there will certainly not (Greek ''ou mē'')&lt;ref name="JN"&gt;John Nolland, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9cL_kpdUE-oC&amp;pg=PA1006 The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8028-2389-0}}, pp. 1006–1008.&lt;/ref&gt; be enough for them to share. While the foolish virgins are away trying to get more oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins then accompany him to the celebration. The others arrive too late and are excluded.

{{quotation|Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, "Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!" Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out." But the wise answered, saying, "What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But he answered, "Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you." Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] is coming.|Matthew 25:1-13, [[World English Bible]]}}

==Interpretations==
The parable is one of a sequence of responses to a question in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|24:3]]:

{{quotation|And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?|Matthew 24:3, [[King James Version]]}}

Other parables in this sequence include the [[parable of the budding fig tree]] (Matthew 24:32–35) and the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]] (Matthew 24:42–51). The parable of the Ten Virgins reinforces the call for readiness in the face of the uncertain time of this second "coming."&lt;ref name="RTF"&gt;R. T. France, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttTgacXnLV8C&amp;pg=PA349 The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary]'', Eerdmans, 1985, {{ISBN|0-8028-0063-7}}, pp. 349-352.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "watching parable."&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: PARABLES].&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[parable of the Lost Coin]], it is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.&lt;ref&gt;The [[parable of the Lost Coin]] follows the [[parable of the Lost Sheep]] and this parable follows the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francken, Hieronymus the Younger - Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins - c. 1616.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This painting by Hieronymus [[Francken]] the Younger (c. 1616) gives a moralistic interpretation of the parable.]]
In this parable, Jesus Christ is the bridegroom,&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; echoing the [[Old Testament]] image of God as the bridegroom in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Jeremiah#Chapter 2|2:2]] and similar passages.&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; The awaited event is the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; [[R. T. France]] writes that the parable is "a warning addressed specifically to those inside the professing  church who are not to assume that their future is unconditionally assured."&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;

The parable does not criticise the virgins for sleeping, since both groups do that,&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[[Ben Witherington III|Ben Witherington]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGePuntVBhgC&amp;pg=PA43 Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life]'', Cambridge University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-521-34781-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but for being unprepared as they brought no oil (it is unclear as to whether the foolish virgins succeed in purchasing any oil that night:&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ArODuoyndAC&amp;pg=PA134 Hearing the Word of God: Reflections on the Sunday Readings: Year A]'', Liturgical Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8146-2785-4}}, p. 134: "We never know whether they found it, but when they return, the feast has started and the door is barred."&lt;/ref&gt; most shops would not have been open&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig S. Keener]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8C2Y_HaL5W0C&amp;pg=PA597 The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary]'', Eerdmans, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8028-6498-8}}, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Dwight Pentecost]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_VVxjLkN2UC&amp;pg=PA150 The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in life from the Master Teacher]'', Kregel Publications, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8254-3458-0}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The parable is not written in praise of virginity,&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; and indeed [[Louis of Granada]], in his ''The Sinner's Guide'' of 1555, writes "No one makes intercession with the Bridegroom for the five foolish virgins who, after despising the pleasures of the flesh and stifling in their hearts the fire of concupiscence, nay, after observing the great counsel of virginity, neglected the precept of humility and became inflated with pride on account of their virginity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis of Granada]], ''[http://www.ewtn.org/library/SPIRIT/granada1-9.htm The Sinner's Guide]'', 1555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer W. Kimball]] gave an [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] perspective on the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins, and why they could not share the oil: "This was not selfishness or unkindness. The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle of tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity.... Each must obtain that kind of oil for himself .... In the parable, oil can be purchased at the market. In our lives the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by drop in righteous living."&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], ''Faith Precedes the Miracle'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDS Business College - 14Jul2010 - LDS interpretation "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldsbc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1235:preparation-a-learning-model-discovery&amp;catid=9:devotionals&amp;Itemid=554|title=LDS Business College Devotional - Preparation: A Learning Model Discovery|last=Henrie|first=Lynda|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=[[LDS Business College]]|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
While "a considerable number of exegetes in fact suppose that the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Virgins' ultimately goes back to Jesus,"&lt;ref name="JL"&gt;[[Jan Lambrecht (New Testament scholar)|Jan Lambrecht]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PXfgMs0FIbgC&amp;pg=PA204 Out of the Treasure: The parables in the Gospel of Matthew]'', Peeters, 1991, {{ISBN|90-6831-161-1}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; some Bible commentators, because of its [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] nature,  doubt that Jesus ever told this parable and that, instead, it is a parable created by the very early church. A large majority of fellows on the [[Jesus Seminar]], for example, designated the parable as merely similar to something Jesus might have said or simply inauthentic ("gray" or "black").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The Five Gospels.'' Harper:San Francisco, 1993, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars believe that this parable has only been lightly edited, and is an excellent example of Jesus' skill in telling parables.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klyne Snodgrass]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kFyt0VhErywC&amp;pg=PA505 Stories with Intent: A comprehensive guide to the parables of Jesus]'', Eerdmans, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8028-4241-0}}, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; The parable occurs in all ancient [[New Testament manuscripts]], with only slight variations in some words.&lt;ref&gt;United Bible Societies, ''The Greek New Testament'', 1983, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical use==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the parable is the Gospel reading for the 32nd Sunday in [[Ordinary Time]] in Cycle A; in the extraordinary form of the Roman rite (Tridentine Mass), the parable is the Gospel reading for Masses of virgins and virgin martyrs (including, by coincidence, St. [[Cecilia of Rome|Cecily]] on November 22 and St. [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] on November 25, giving it a certain prominence at the fitting time of the end of the liturgical year). The parable is the Gospel reading for the 27th Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] in the traditional [[Lutheran]] lectionary. In the [[Revised Common Lectionary]], the parable is read in ''[[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] 27 (32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time)''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=168 |website=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/ |publisher=Vanderbilt University |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] the parable is the main theme of [[Holy Monday]]. A special Church service enacting the parable of the ten virgins is celebrated on Tuesday evening of the [[Holy Week]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the parable is used to commemorate the Sunday [[vespers]] service of [[Nahire]]. Nahire symbolizes our lives in accordance with the 10 virgins that only through a life of dedication, vigilance, fasting and prayer can we be ready for the Bridegroom himself.

==In the arts==
This parable has been a popular subject for painting, sculpture, music, and drama.

[[File:Schadow,FW-Die klugen und törichten Jungfrauen-1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], ''The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins'', 1838–1842 (detail), [[Städel|Städel Museum]],  Frankfurt am Main.]]

===Painting===
The parable has been depicted in several paintings, including altarpieces in Northern Europe.  A recent example, from 1954, is by [[Tove Jansson]]. In the 19th century, the artists of the [[Nazarene movement]] also took up this theme.

===Sculpture===
Sculptures of the wise and foolish virgins were a common motif in mediaeval ecclesial architecture in Europe, especially for the decoration of doorways, and carved figures representing them appear on many of the mediaeval churches and cathedrals of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], including:
[[File:France Strasbourg Cathedral Wise virgins and Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Three wise virgins appear with [[Christ]] on [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].]]
* [[Amiens Cathedral]]
* [[Auxerre Cathedral]]
* [[Laon Cathedral]]
* [[Notre Dame de Paris]]
* [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]]
* [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]
* [[Erfurt Cathedral]]
* [[Cathedral of Magdeburg|Magdeburg Cathedral]]

The virgins are also depicted on cathedrals in Switzerland and other countries; the portal leading into the main church of [[Hovhannavank]] (1216-1221) in Armenia has carved scenes from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins.

The ubiquity of such sculptures has inspired fictional descriptions, such as the carvings on the doors of Kingsbridge cathedral in [[Ken Follett|Ken Follett's]] novel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'', set in the [[Late Middle Ages]].

===Music===
Several religious musical compositions have been inspired by the parable. Its message was formed into a [[hymn]], "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]", by [[Philipp Nicolai]], which [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used for his [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]] [[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140|''Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme'', BWV 140]]. The parable forms the theme for several hymns, including the 19th century hymn "Behold the Bridegroom Cometh" by [[George Frederick Root]], which begins:

We’ve tarried for the Bridegroom,&lt;br&gt;
Oh, may we enter in?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Wise Virgins]] is a one-act ballet, written in 1941 by [[William Walton]], based on the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with choreography by Frederick Ashton.  It is based on the biblical Parable of the Ten Virgins.

"[[Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning]]" is a [[gospel blues]] song based on the parable. It has been recorded by such artists as [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Pearly Brown|Reverend Pearly Brown]], and [[Reverend Gary Davis|Rev. "Blind" Gary Davis]].

Non-religious music has also used the parable as a theme, such as the ballet "The wise and the foolish virgins" by Swedish composer [[Kurt Atterberg]] (1887–1974), written in 1920.

A reference is made to the parable in the 2002 [[Johnny Cash]] song "[[The Man Comes Around (song)|The Man Comes Around]]," which draws heavily on the Bible.

On the 1974 album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] - ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', a reference to the parable is made in the song ''[[The Carpet Crawlers]]'': "and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright."

American composer [[Emily Freeman-Brown]] has also composed an [[oratorio]] based on the parable. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Drama===
From early Christian times, the story of the ten virgins has been told as a [[mystery play]]. [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] wrote the ''Banquet of the Ten Virgins'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0623.htm Banquet of the Ten Virgins]''&lt;/ref&gt; a mystery play in Greek. ''[[Sponsus]]'', a mid-11th-century play, was performed in both Latin and Occitan. The German play ''[[Ludus de decem virginibus]]'' was first performed on 4 May 1321. There was also a Dutch play of the late Middle Ages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">A ''' pillar tomb''' is a type of monumental [[grave]] wherein the central feature is a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone.

==Overview==
[[File:Pillar_tomb_(Malindi).JPG|thumb|Pillar tomb in Malindi, Kenya]]
A number of world cultures incorporated pillars into tomb structures. Examples of such edifices are found in the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony of [[Lycia]] in [[Anatolia]] (e.g., the [[Harpy Tomb]] at [[Xanthos]]), and the [[medieval]] Muslim [[Swahili culture]] of the [[Swahili Coast]] (e.g., tombs at [[Malindi]] and [[Mnarani]]), which were originally built of [[coral rag]], and later of stone.

In the historic town of [[Hannassa]] in southern [[Somalia]], ruins of houses with [[arch]]ways and [[courtyard]]s have been found along with pillar tombs, including a rare [[octagon]]al one.&lt;ref name="Arotssc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanseverino|first1=Hilary Costa|title=Archaeological Remains on the Southern Somali Coast|journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date=1983|volume=18|issue=1|pages=151–164|doi=10.1080/00672708309511319|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00672708309511319#.VGJ0To938jg|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Port Dunford]], situated nearby, also contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs. Prior to its collapse, one of these structures' pillars stood {{convert|11|m|ft}} high from the ground, making it the tallest of its kind in the region.&lt;ref name="Adam106"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hussein Mohamed Adam, Charles Lee Geshekter (ed.)|title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies|date=1992|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=0891306587|page=106|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4754">'''Press support''' is a government [[subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s in some countries. The support can either be direct, in terms of money to the newspaper, or indirect, such as lowered or eliminated [[sales tax]]. The justification for press support is typically to maintain some level of diversity in the media market.

== Press support by country ==
=== Norway ===
Press support is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[subsidy|state subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The subsidy is twofold; the first part is a direct subsidy of the second- largest, by circulation, newspapers in each city. The other subsidy is that newspaper are subject to no [[sales tax]] (as are [[book]]s).
====Direct support====
The direct subsidy is managed by the [[Norwegian Media Authority]], and was [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 303 million in 2006, paid to 138 newspapers. It was introduced in 1965, because of the fear of a massive newspaper death like [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] had seen, mainly the second largest newspapers in each city. Also, at the time, most newspapers were not [[political neutrality|political neutral]], with many papers being controlled by either [[conservativism|conservative forces]], the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|labour movement]] or [[List of political parties in Norway|political parties]]. Support is given to all newspapers that are do not have the largest circulation in the city of publishing. There are limitations on the newspapers who can receive support, including that the support will cease if they pay a [[dividend]] to their owners. Other support is given to [[media studies|media research]], follow-up studies, [[sami people|sami newspapers]], immigrant publications and distribution support for [[Finnmark]].

The press support has been partially successful, with a number of second-largest newspapers surviving, like ''[[Bergensavisen]]'' (Bergen), ''[[Rogalands Avis]]'' (Stavanger) and ''[[Dagsavisen]]'' (Oslo). Other secondary newspapers have been closed, like ''[[Trondheims-Pressen]]''. The largest receivers are often national newspapers, targeting special (often political) sectors, like ''[[Klassekampen]]'' (Socialist), ''[[Nationen]]'' (Agrarian) and ''[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]]'' (Christian). Most of the large, [[business newspaper|business]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers, like [[Dagbladet]] or [[Dagens Næringsliv]], do not receive support, since they pay dividend to their owners.

====Indirect support====
By far the greatest level of support to newspapers arises out of their exemption from sales tax and exceeds NOK 1 billion. This exemption was instituted to foster a variety of perspectives from newspapers; to stimulate public debate and consciousness, [[democracy]], [[freedom of speech]] and to enable the media to act as society's watch-dog.

'''[[Edward Elgar]]'s Third Symphony''' [[Opus number|Op.]] 88 (posth.) was incomplete at the time of his death in 1934. Elgar left 130 pages of sketches which the British composer [[Anthony Payne]] worked on for many years, producing a complete symphony in 1997, officially known as "Edward Elgar: the sketches for Symphony No 3 elaborated by Anthony Payne" or in brief "Elgar/Payne Symphony No 3". The first public performance was at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] on 15 February 1998, by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]].&lt;ref name=Naxos&gt;notes to Naxos recording 8.554719&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the death of his wife in 1920, Elgar retreated into semi-retirement, producing no large-scale works. His friend and champion [[George Bernard Shaw]] held that the [[BBC]] should commission a new Elgar symphony, and with the aid of [[Landon Ronald]] he persuaded the BBC to do so. Elgar worked on the new piece during the last year of his life, jotting down many short snatches of a few bars as well as some pages in full score.&lt;ref name=NMC&gt;notes to NMC recording D053&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising that he would not complete the score, the dying Elgar did not destroy the sketches, and made contradictory remarks about the unfinished work. He told his friend, the violinist [[William Henry Reed|W. H. "Billy" Reed]], "Don’t let anyone tinker with it", but to his doctor he said, "If I can’t complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it – or write a better one."&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt; Elgar and Reed had often played through various sketches for the symphony on violin and piano, and Reed knew more than anyone about Elgar's intentions. Reed reproduced more than forty pages of the most important sketches in his book ''Elgar as I Knew Him'' in 1936, probably to illustrate what he believed to be the impossibility of weaving them into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name=NMC&gt;notes to NMC recording D053&lt;/ref&gt; But their publication meant that seventy years later they would come into the [[public domain]] and the Elgar family would be powerless to prevent anyone "tinkering" with them.&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

In 1974, a [[BBC Radio 3]] producer, Dr Roger Fiske, devised a programme about the Symphony, and orchestrated some of the sketches, completed Elgar's unfinished scoring and composed some other passages. Elgar's daughter gave her approval and [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] agreed to conduct the music. 
The score was sent for copying to Maurice Johnstone, a former BBC head of music. Johnstone felt strongly that the broadcast would amount to "tinkering" with the score and he successfully persuaded Boult to withdraw from the project on ethical grounds and the programme was subsequently dropped. A similar proposed feature for BBC television in 1979 also came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March et al., p.481&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Payne]] had become interested in the sketches in 1972, and in 1993 the BBC invited him to work on them for a workshop performance. In the event the performance did not take place, because of objections from the Elgar family. Payne nevertheless continued to work on the sketches, completing the Scherzo, the Adagio and the first movement of the work. The Elgar family decided to commission Payne to make an authorised version.&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

Payne later wrote, "It was during this process that I became more consciously aware of the overall sweep of the symphony. It was different in its sheer breadth of emotion from any of his other symphonic works: there was the raw vigour and magic lyricism of the opening movement, the use of a lighter manner in the second which went far beyond his established symphonic practice, and the searing intensity of the Adagio, tragic in its import, while the finale revealed a world of chivalric action and drama." &lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

His greatest difficulty was in completing the finale, as Elgar had left few clues about its structure and none about how it would end. Payne wrote the whole of the development section and the coda, deciding to end the work quietly, following the model of "The Wagon Passes" in Elgar’s late work the ''[[Nursery Suite]]''. "The finale's main subject actually suggests this kind of treatment, and it would lead the music away into some new visionary world, spanning the years between the composer's death and my attempted realisation of his sketches. I trusted my intuition and went ahead and wrote".&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

In the UK, performances were given in 1998 and 1999 in most of the major cities, including [[Glasgow]] (24 September), [[Birmingham]] (25 September), [[Bristol]] (10 October/27 January), [[Liverpool]] (24 October), [[Manchester]] (17 December) and [[Cambridge]] (29 January). International performances were programmed as far afield as [[Brussels]], [[Ljubljana]], [[St Petersburg]], Hong Kong and [[Winnipeg]]. The United States premiere took place on 20 November 1998 with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]], followed by performances by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] with Davis and the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] with [[Leonard Slatkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/news/further_info.asp?NewsID=40&amp;LangID=  Boosey &amp; Hawkes website ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was described by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] as "a brilliant and heartfelt recuperation of musical ideas and one that has helped to revitalise our musical culture".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Symphony, in four movements, takes about 55 minutes in performance.

* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] [[molto]] [[maestoso]]
:The symphony opens in a sweeping sequence of parallel open fifths and octaves (the first seventeen bars of which Elgar left in full score) building to a march rhythm. By contrast the second subject is "sublimely wistful".&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exposition repeat indicated by Elgar, and a calm new theme for strings introduces the development section, which later has a lively theme for the horns. A march section in B flat minor follows. After the recapitulation, the coda brings together the main themes and the movement ends with a majestic C major conclusion based on the opening theme. The movement, taking about sixteen minutes in performance, though on a large scale, is shorter than the equivalent movements of Elgar's first and second symphonies.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO&gt;notes to LSO Live recording LSO00072&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Scherzo]]: [[allegretto]]
:The scherzo is in great contrast to those of the first two symphonies, both of which are fast and forceful. It is, however, the movement of which the sketches provided the clearest indications of Elgar's intentions, and the gentle wistfulness is in a recognisable ''[[Wand of Youth]]'' style. A light dance-tune with a prominent part for the tambourine recurs like a rondo. There are two contrasting episodes, the second of which features an A major theme in pastoral vein.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

* [[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Adagio]] solenne
:Elgar wrote that the opening bars of the slow movement would "open some vast bronze doors into something strangely unfamiliar". The first main theme is elegiac, the D major second subject offering gentler contrast. The recapitulation emphasises the brooding first theme, and the movement ends with a single solo viola note, marked ''fine''; "this is the end", Elgar said of this phrase.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

* Allegro
:The opening of the finale returns to the heroic tone of the start of the symphony with a rousing fanfare (scored by Elgar). It is the movement of which the least original Elgar material exists, and Payne was obliged to contribute a quantity of original music. The martial opening theme has a subsidiary theme in Elgar's ''nobilmente'' vein. The climax of the movement is a large-scale crescendo-decrescendo modelled by Payne on "The Wagon Passes" in the ''[[Nursery Suite]]''. The hushed ending dies away in a long [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] note from the [[tamtam|tam tam]].&lt;ref name=Gramophone/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

==Recordings==
The first recording was made for the [[NMC Recordings|NMC]] label by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]], in October 1997, four months before the first public performance. Subsequent recordings have been made by:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">The '''Symphony in G minor''' was the only completed [[symphony]] written by [[Ernest John Moeran]].  He wrote it in 1934–37.  It is in four movements.

In 1926, the conductor of the [[The Hallé|Hallé Orchestra]], Sir [[Hamilton Harty]], commissioned a symphony from Moeran.&lt;ref name=goliath&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2556478/Moeran-Symphony-Sinfonietta-Guide-to.html Goliath]&lt;/ref&gt;  He had already been working on a symphony since 1924, and the premiere performance of the new work was announced for 4 March 1926.  However, when it was almost finished, he decided he was not satisfied with its structure and withdrew it.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/962517 JSTOR, December 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next eight years he worked on his revision of the piece, but in 1934 he abandoned his sketches and started again.  He reused some earlier material, but the work was substantially new.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt; The symphony was finished on 24 January 1937,&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;[http://frombeyondthestave.blogspot.com/2009/07/most-glorious-of-english-symphonies.html From Beyond the Stave: The most glorious of English symphonies]&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to Harty.&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.555837&amp;catNum=555837&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English# Naxos]&lt;/ref&gt; Harty initially refused the dedication after he was overlooked as the conductor for the first performance (by now he was ill and had left the Hallé Orchestra).&lt;ref name=goliath/&gt;&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

The work takes about 45 minutes to play, and is in four movements:
* ''Allegro''
* ''Lento''
* ''Vivace''&lt;ref&gt;A sort of [[scherzo]], though not marked as such in score.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Lento – Allegro molto''

The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute]]s (II takes piccolo), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]] ([[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[tamtam]], [[tenor drum]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbals]]), [[harp]], and [[string instrument|string]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Instrumentation from the 1942(/1943?) Novello student? score (plate 16985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony's first movement is a robust sonata form, with a questioning harmonic structure.

Much of the work was written in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]], where Moeran spent most of this time, but the slow second movement was inspired by the sand dunes and marshes of East [[Norfolk]], [[England]],&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt; and may have its roots in Moeran's 1924 arrangement of a folk-song called ''The Shooting of His Dear'' (the 5th of his ''Six Songs from Norfolk'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/moeran/symphony.php Classical Net] This connection was suggested by Geoffrey Self, a Moeran biographer, but remains conjectural, not supported, in his biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance was on 13 January 1938 in the [[Queen's Hall]], played by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], conducted by [[Leslie Heward]], whom Moeran considered to be the work's finest interpreter.&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;  It was played at [[The Proms|a Prom Concert]] on 11 August 1938, with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] under Sir [[Henry Wood]].  (It did not receive its second performance at the Proms until 23 July 2009, under [[Vassily Sinaisky]].&lt;ref name=prom&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/5779831/Proms-2009-EJ-Moerans-Symphony-in-G-Minor.html The Telegraph, 8 July 2009, Proms 2009: EJ Moeran's Symphony in G Minor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/work/symphony-in-g-minor/11831 BBC Proms Archive - Moeran Symphony in G minor Appearances]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The work and its orchestration show the influence of other composers, including [[Arnold Bax|Bax]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Peter Warlock|Warlock]], [[Bernard van Dieren|van Dieren]], and most particularly [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Oct02/Ernest_John_MOERAN.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scherzo begins and ends with a solo oboe, as does the Scherzo of Sibelius's [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|4th Symphony]]; there are echoes of ''[[Tapiola (Sibelius)|Tapiola]]''.  The influence of folk elements is also apparent: [[Eric Blom]] said it contains "a touch of dialect".  There are also [[jazz]]-influenced rhythms.&lt;ref name=prom/&gt;

The work was originally subject to considerable criticism, on the grounds that it was too derivative ([[Wilfrid Mellers]] said it could not have been written before [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] had shown how to write a symphony&lt;ref name=prom/&gt;), undisciplined and showed the composer's inexperience of symphonic form.&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Vol. V, p. 813&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, however, it had become accepted. In that year, [[Novello &amp; Co]] published the symphony,&lt;ref&gt;See {{OCLC|4623556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Council]] undertook a promotion of British culture overseas.  The music section of the project was a recording of significant recent compositions by British composers, and Moeran's Symphony in G minor was the first work to be recorded.&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt;  It was recorded in November/December 1942, in [[Manchester]], with the Hallé Orchestra under Leslie Heward.  The composer was present for some of the sessions (he proved to be a distraction, and it was suggested he let the musicians get on with their job without his "assistance"). Heward was already seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]], and died only five months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audaud.com/article.php?ArticleID=6396 Audiophile Audition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conductors to record Moeran's Symphony in G minor include [[Neville Dilkes]] ([[English Sinfonia]], 1972), Sir [[Adrian Boult]] ([[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia Orchestra]], released 1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|10632467}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernon Handley]] ([[Ulster Orchestra]], 1987) and [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]] ([[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]], 2001).

Moeran completed no more full symphonies.  His three-movement ''Sinfonietta'' appeared in 1944, and an orchestral ''Serenade'' in 1948.  He was working on a second symphony (in E{{music|flat}}) at the time of his death in 1950. The manuscript of that work&lt;ref&gt;the sketches to the 2nd symphony have since been edited, realised (by [[Martin Yates]], in 2011) and recorded on [[Dutton Vocalion|Dutton Epoch]] - see http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2012/Mar12/Moeran_sy2_CDLX7281.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and various others were donated by his widow [[Peers Coetmore]] to the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

'''Tabriz Cartoon''' is an annual international [[Caricature (comics)|caricature]] competition held in [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tabrizcartoons.com/en/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tabriz cartoon museum is the first and only cartoon and caricature museum in Iran and it is also one of the five official cartoon museums in the world. After the House of Humor and Satire in [[Gabrovo]], [[Bulgaria]], it is the second widest museum in the world. This museum was playing the host to the second meeting of the heads of cartoon museums in the world, which there was representatives of countries such as Italy, France, Turkey, [[Azerbaijan]], Syria, and Belgium . It was established in the west part of Tabriz Art Home in March 2007. It is affiliated with the department of culture but it doesn't have any annual budget. Its funds are generated from cartoonists society income and the government's financial support. The building infrastructure has been created with an area of 284 m. at the same time with Tabriz Municipal House in 1318 and it has been used as Officers Club, restaurant, Islamic Revolutions' Committee, [[Tabriz National Library]], and at last Tabriz cartoon museum over the years. It consists of two galleries with 60 original artworks of the most prominent world's cartoonists, a special library, classes and administrative division. There are stored two thousand original artworks from a hundred countries in the museum archive. This museum is the place of the Tabriz cartoonists' society which has held lots of international festivals like twelve courses of Tabriz Festival, six courses of Tabriz Citizenship Festival, a resistance festival, and some courses of the national festival. A set of foreign festivals' albums and foreign publications are the other products and activities of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabrizcartoons.com|title=صفحه اول - Tabriz Cartoons|website=www.tabrizcartoons.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this museum except two cartoon statute of Mr. Maqfuriun, there is a collection of cartoon posters and postcards and stamps and business cards in addition to cartoon books which has printed in Tabriz.

A '''teddy bear''' is a [[stuffed toy|soft toy]] in the form of a [[bear]]. Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers [[Morris Michtom]] in the U.S. and [[Richard Steiff]] in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]], the teddy bear became an iconic children's toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.&lt;ref name=APOV&gt;[[David Cannadine]], ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21265701  A point of view - The Grownups with teddy bears]'', 1 February 2013, (accessed 2013-02-01)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, "teddies" have greatly varied in form, style, color, and material.  They have become [[collectable|collector's items]], with older and rarer "teddies" appearing at public auctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=salesummary&amp;intObjectID=5359783 | title = A STEIFF HARLEQUIN TEDDY BEAR, jointed, half red and half blue mohair, one blue and black and one brown and black glass eye, black stitching, yellow felt pads and FF button, circa 1925 --13½in.

==History&lt;span id="Teddy bear (cartoon)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
[[File:TheodoreRooseveltTeddyBear.jpg|thumb|A 1902 political cartoon in ''[[The Washington Post]]''  spawned the ''teddy bear'' name.]]

The name ''teddy bear'' comes from former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was commonly known as "Teddy" (though he loathed being referred to as such).&lt;ref name=HandyBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Matuz|first=Roger|title=The Handy Presidents Answer Book|year=2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Canton, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in [[Mississippi]] in November 1902, to which Roosevelt was invited by Mississippi Governor [[Andrew H. Longino]]. There were several other hunters competing, and most of them had already killed an animal.  A suite of Roosevelt's attendants, led by [[Holt Collier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/refuges/HoltCollier_history.pdf |title=Holt Collier |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; cornered, clubbed, and tied an [[American black bear]] to a willow tree after a long exhausting chase with [[hound]]s.  They called Roosevelt to the site and suggested that he should shoot it.  He refused to shoot the bear himself, deeming this unsportsmanlike, but instructed that the bear be killed to put it out of its misery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Teddy_Bear.htm "History of the Teddy Bear"]. Retrieved March 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/aa/roosevelt/aa_roosevelt_bears_1.html| title=Teddy Bears| publisher=Library Of Congress| accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became the topic of a [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoon]] by [[Clifford K. Berryman|Clifford Berryman]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on November 16, 1902.&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.teddybearandfriends.com/archive/articles/history.html| title=The History of the Teddy Bear| first = Marianne | last = Clay | year = 2002 | work = Teddy Bear &amp; Friends | publisher = Madavor Media, LLC | accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184018/http://www.teddybearandfriends.com/archive/articles/history.html |archivedate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial cartoon of an adult [[American black bear|black bear]] lassoed by a handler and a disgusted Roosevelt had symbolic overtones, later issues of that and other Berryman cartoons made the bear smaller and cuter.&lt;ref name="theodoreroosevelt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/tr_teddy.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt Association.

[[Morris Michtom]] saw the drawing of Roosevelt and was inspired to create a teddy bear. He created a tiny soft bear cub and put it in the shop window with a sign "Teddy's bear," after sending a bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to use his name.  The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Novelty and Toy Co]].&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

At the same time in Germany, the [[Margarete Steiff GmbH|Steiff firm]], unaware of Michtom's bear, produced a stuffed bear from [[Richard Steiff]]'s designs. Steiff exhibited the toy at the Leipzig Toy Fair in March 1903, where it was seen by Hermann Berg, a buyer for George Borgfeldt &amp; Company in New York (and the brother of composer [[Alban Berg]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2010/07/berg-festival.html|title=Bring on the Berg|website=Alex Ross: The Rest Is Noise}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered 3,000 to be sent to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2537943.stm Teddy bear celebrates 100th birthday] BBC, 2002-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although Steiff's records show that the bears were produced, they are not recorded as arriving in the U.S., and no example of the type, "55 PB", has ever been seen, leading to the story that the bears were [[shipwreck]]ed. However, the story is disputed - Gunther Pfieffer notes that it was only recorded in 1953 and says it is more likely that the 55 PB was not sufficiently durable to survive until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14231337 The great teddy bear shipwreck mystery], BBC News, Francis Cronin, 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although Steiff and Michtom were both making teddy bears at around the same time, neither would have known of the other's creation due to poor [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] communication.&lt;ref name="Clay" /&gt;

North American educator [[Seymour Eaton]] wrote the children's book series ''The Roosevelt Bears'',&lt;ref name="GLCA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lansdownecivic.com/Pages/hometown_stories/13_eaton.html| title=Seymour Eaton| publisher=Greater Lansdowne Civic Association (GLCA)| year=2003| accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while composer [[John Walter Bratton]] wrote an instrumental "[[Teddy bears' picnic|The Teddy Bears' Picnic]]", a "characteristic two-step", in 1907, which later had words written to it by lyricist [[Jimmy Kennedy]] in 1932.

Early teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with extended snouts and beady eyes.  Modern teddy bears tend to have larger eyes and foreheads and smaller noses, [[Infant|babylike]] features that enhance the [[toy]]'s [[cuteness]].  Teddy bears are also manufactured to represent different species of bear, such as [[polar bear]]s and [[grizzly bear]]s, as well as [[giant panda|pandas]].

While early teddy bears were covered in tawny [[mohair]] fur, modern teddy bears are manufactured in a wide variety of commercially available [[fabric]]s, most commonly [[fake fur|synthetic fur]], but also [[velour]], [[denim]], [[cotton]], [[satin]], and [[canvas]].

==Production==

===Commercial===
Commercially made, mass-produced teddy bears are predominantly made as toys for children. These bears either have safety joints for attaching arms, legs, and heads, or else the joints are sewn and not articulated. They must have securely fastened eyes that do not pose a choking hazard for small children. These "plush" bears must meet a rigid standard of construction in order to be marketed to children in the United States and in the European Union.

There are also companies, like Steiff, that sell handmade collectible bears that can be purchased in stores or over the Internet.
The majority of teddy bears are manufactured in countries such as China and Indonesia. A few small, single-person producers in the United States make unique, non-mass-produced teddy bears. In the [[United Kingdom]] one small, traditional teddy bear company remains, [[Merrythought]], which was established in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12523562 BBC News] Britain's last surviving teddy bear factory&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mohair]], the fur shorn or combed from a breed of long haired goats, is woven into cloth, dyed and trimmed. [[Alpaca]] teddy bears are made from the pelt of an alpaca because the fiber is too soft to weave. In addition to mohair and alpaca, there is a huge selection of "plush" or synthetic fur made for the teddy bear market. Both these types of fur are commercially produced.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Amateur===
Teddy bears are a favourite form of soft toy for amateur toy makers, with many patterns commercially produced or available online. Many "teddies" are home-made as gifts or for charity, while "teddy bear artists" often create "teddies" for retail, decorating them individually with commercial and recycled ornaments such as sequins, beads and ribbons .  Sewn teddy bears are made from a wide range of materials including [[felt]], [[cotton]] and [[velour]]. While many are stitched, others are made from [[yarn]], either [[Knitting|knitted]] or [[crochet]]ed. Teddy bears are also made of plywood and a range of other craft materials.

===Antiques===
Michtom's jointed [[mohair]] "Teddy's bear" was very popular when first designed and remains so with collectors today. Fake bears look suspiciously new and unhandled: their noses are unworn, and their seams may be thick and uneven. All Ideal bears have jointed hips, necks, and shoulders. Early examples have a characteristic "American football" shape and are mostly made of short gold or beige mohair plush with matching felt paws, and distinctive, sharply pointed foot pads. They have shoe-button or glass eyes, and the fur around the muzzle may be shorn. Later bears were made in a large variety of colours and types—for example, pandas—and had longer fur.

Other collectible bears include ones by the Knickerbocker Toy Co. (active 1924–1925) in New York, which are clearly marked with a label in the front seam. Similar to many early American bears, Knickerbocker bears usually have long bodies, small feet, and short, straight arms and legs. Their later bears can be recognized by their large inverted ears and big noses. Other collectible bears include Gund Manufacturing Co.

Retail sales of stuffed plush animals including teddy bears totaled $1.3 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/18/182/182478/items/286985/2007_AR_FINAL.pdf |title=Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc. |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly sold brands include [[Gund]] and [[Ty Inc.]] Brands associated with teddy bears that enjoyed strong popularity in the 1980s and 1990s are [[Teddy Ruxpin]] and [[Care Bears]]. Various TV shows and movies have a teddy bear depicted, such as ''[[Super Ted]]'' and ''[[Mr. Bean]]''.

Teddy bears have seen a resurgence in popularity as international "do-it-yourself" chains have opened. Among the largest and best-known are [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] and [[Vermont Teddy Bear Company]].

Some popular mass-marketed teddy bears made today include [[Rupert Bear|Rupert]], [[Sooty]], [[Paddington Bear|Paddington]], and [[Children in Need#History|Pudsey Bear]]. Books have also been written with the teddy bear featured as their main character. These include [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Corduroy (book)|Corduroy]], Teddy Tells Time, Tristan the Teddy Bear (from the Teddy Bear Tales) and [[Teddy Dressing]].

==="The Teddy Bears' Picnic"===
The popularity of the toy inspired [[John Walter Bratton]] to compose the melody "[[Teddy Bears' Picnic|The Teddy Bears' Picnic]]" (1907).  The lyrics were added in 1932 by [[Jimmy Kennedy]].

===Teddy bear museums===
The world's first [[teddy bear museum]] was set up in [[Petersfield, Hampshire]], England, in 1984. In 1990, [[Teddy Bear Museum of Naples|a similar foundation]] was set up in [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], [[Florida]], United States. These were closed in 2006 and 2005 respectively, and the bears were sold in auctions, but there are many teddy bear museums around the world today.

===Teddy Bear Cops program===
Because police, fire and emergency officials found that giving a teddy bear to a child during a crisis stabilized and calmed them, [[NAPLC]] created the Teddy Bear Cops program to distribute teddy bears to police, fire, and emergency officials throughout the United States, for their use in providing teddy bears to children in emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teddybearcop.com/ |title=Officers using the Teddy Bear Cops program |publisher=Teddybearcop.com |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brunus edwardii'' April fool===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 1972, issue 90 of ''[[The Veterinary Record]]'' published a paper on the diseases of ''Brunus edwardii'' detailing common afflictions of teddy bears.&lt;ref name="Brunusedwardii-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/af_database/permalink/brunus_edwardii/|title=Brunus edwardii (1972)|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunusedwardii-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackmore |first=DK |author2=DG Owen |author3=CM Young |year=1972 |title=Some observations on the diseases of Brunus edwardii (Species nova) |url=http://veterinaryrecord.bvapublications.com/content/vol90/issue14/index.dtl |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=90 |issue=14 |pages=382–385 |doi=10.1136/vr.90.14.382 |accessdate=27 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122043827/http://veterinaryrecord.bvapublications.com/content/vol90/issue14/index.dtl |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
* [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] is the name of a fictional character created by [[A. A. Milne]], based on a teddy bear owned by his son [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]], who was the basis of the [[Christopher Robin|eponymous character]] in A. A. Milne's work. Milne wrote many stories featuring Pooh Bear, some of which were adapted by the [[Walt Disney Company]] into theatrical shorts or compiled into movies such as 1977's ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' and the 2011 film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]''.
* ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'' (2012), and its sequel, ''[[Ted 2]]'' (2015), are comedy movies, raunchy spoofs of stories where children's teddy bears come to life.
* ''[[Misery Bear]]'' a series of short films published on the [[BBC]] website.

'''''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer''''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|f|aɪ|f|ər}} {{respell|pə|FY|fər}}) is an American [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] that aired on [[UPN]] in 1998. Before it was even debuted, the series set off a storm of controversy because of a perceived light-hearted take on the issue of [[American slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|title=A Racial TV Battle: Blacks Rip Sitcom About Lincoln Butler That Find Humor in Slavery|last=Millner|first=Denene|date=1998-09-20|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2009-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101634/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|archivedate=2009-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
A black English nobleman named Desmond Pfeiffer, chased out of England due to gambling debts, becomes President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s valet. In the show, he serves as the intelligent and erudite backbone of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[White House]] populated by louts and [[drunkard]]s.

==Cast==
* [[Chi McBride]] as Desmond Pfeiffer, Black English gentleman serving as President Lincoln's butler
* [[Dann Florek]] as [[Abraham Lincoln]], 16th President of the United States
* [[Christine Estabrook]] as [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], President Lincoln's wife
* Max Baker as Nibblet, Pfeiffer's assistant
* Kelly Connell as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], General of the United States Army

==Controversy==
Before the series' premiere, several African American activist groups, including the Los Angeles area [[NAACP]], protested against the premise of the series. On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside [[Paramount Studios]]. Five days later, [[UPN]] released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. The first episode of the series aired on October 5, 1998, ranking 116th out of 125 television programs for that week. ''Desmond Pfeiffer'' was removed from UPN's schedule on October 24 and, after airing one episode two days after being removed from UPN's lineup, was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/category/q-and-a/|title=Q &amp; A: The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, Whodunnit?|date=2009-05-20|publisher=tvobscurities.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed the show as the eleventh-worst TV series ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 [[TV Guide Network]] listed the show at #15 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News - TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=2010-03-02|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film Threat]]'s Phil Hall gave the show a positive review, writing, "Today, the show is remembered (barely) as a bizarre flop – but after watching a pair of episodes that are currently available for YouTube viewing, I would be bold enough to declare that "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer" deserves a new consideration. ... If you have the patience for crass, innuendo-laced, no-taste bawdy comedy, you will certainly find yourself laughing out loud over this series."&lt;ref name=filmthreat/&gt;

The series was alluded to multiple times in the unaired pilot episode of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'', "Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make", which featured Dante and Randal drawing inspiration from a non-existent episode of ''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'', which Randal describes as "classic Pfeiffer".&lt;ref name=filmthreat&gt;http://www.filmthreat.com/features/58140/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10226">'''''Auðunar þáttr vestfirska''''' ('''''The Tale of Auðun of the West Fjords''''') is a short tale (or [[þáttr]]) preserved in three distinct versions as part of the saga of [[Harald III of Norway]] (reigned 1047–66, a.k.a. Haraldr inn harðráði Sigurðsson), as the saga is told in the manuscripts [[Morkinskinna]], [[Flateyjarbók]], and several others. Widely translated and anthologised, it is admired for its beautifully simple account&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, in the introduction to his ''Eirik the Red and Other Icelandic Sagas'', Oxford, 1961, which includes it, calls it "so seeming-simple, . . . the best of all Icelandic ''þættir'' and one of the most flawless short stories ever written" (p. xv).&lt;/ref&gt; of a poor Icelander from the [[Westfjords]], the harshest region of the country, who decides to take a polar bear as a present to [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] (reigned 1047-74/76, a.k.a. Sveinn Úlfsson). Auðun sticks to his task despite having to pass through the court of Haraldr, who is continually at odds with Sweyn, and proceeds on a pilgrimage to Rome. Auðun's mixture of determination, audacity and humility leads him to gain the respect of both kings, and through him their respect for one another increases also.

Although ostensibly historical, the work is more plausibly to be seen as 'a historified folktale'.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Ciklamini,  "''Exempla'' in an Old Norse Historiographic Mold", ''Neophilologus'', 81.1 (1997), 71-87, {{doi|10.1023/A:1004216615263}}, at p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Map of Auðun's Travels in Auðun's Tale.png|thumb|Map detailing Auðun's course of travel in Auðun's Tale, beginning and ending in Iceland.]]

Auðun of the Westfjords is a poor man working for his relative Þorstein. A Norwegian ship arrives and Auðun aids the captain Þórir with advice and sells goods for him. In return, Þórir grants Auðun passage, and Auðun makes financial arrangements to support his mother for three years. Auðun then travels to Greenland, where he meets a hunter named Eirik and buys a polar bear from him with the remainder of his money. The hunter warns Auðun about spending his entire fortune on the bear, but Auðun does not heed his warning.

Next Auðun travels to Norway and meets [[Harald III of Norway|King Haraldr]] at a feast. The king asks if Auðun will sell or give him the bear, and Auðun replies that he intends to give it as a gift to [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Sweyn of Denmark]], with whom King Haraldr happens to be at war. Haraldr chastises Auðun for wanting to give a gift to his enemy, but instead of harming Auðun, grants him passage.

By the time Auðun crosses into Denmark, he has run out of provisions for himself and his bear, and a king's steward named Aki offers him help on the condition that he receives ownership of half the bear in return. Auðun is forced to accept and the two men seek audience with the king. King Sweyn banishes Aki for interfering with Auðun's gift-giving, and invites Auðun to stay with him.

After some time, Auðun asks King Sweyn leave to go on [[pilgrimage]] to Rome. The king gives him money and other pilgrims to accompany him and asks him to return to him when he is done.

Auðun successfully completes his pilgrimage, but becomes ill during his return. He arrives back in Denmark, bald and almost completely unrecognizable. King Sweyn's retainers laugh at him, but the king responds by saying that he has provided for his soul more than they have. He gives Auðun new clothes and offers him to stay as his cupbearer. Auðun replies he cannot stay and must return to Iceland, since the three-year period he set money aside to provide for his mother is nearly up. Upon parting, the king gives him a ship, a bag full of silver, and an arm ring, saying that he should only give the ring to a high-ranking person if he needs to repay a debt.

After departing, Auðun travels back to Norway and relates his experiences with King Sweyn to King Haraldr, from his acceptance of the bear to funding his pilgrimage to Rome and hospitality. Auðun describes his gifts from King Sweyn, and with each item, King Haraldr says he would have done the same for Auðun, except the bag of silver. Auðun then comes to the ring, and gives it to King Haraldr, since he owes him for granting him passage to complete his journey. The king accepts the ring, and gives Auðun a sword and cloak before he departs.

Auðun returns to Iceland and has good fortune for the rest of his life there.

==Themes==

Auðun's Tale is driven largely by Auðun's luck. William Ian Miller explains the etymology of Auðun's name, tracing the elements back to vinr, meaning 'friend' and auð, meaning 'luck, good fortune, fate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Audun and the Polar Bear: Luck, Law, and Largesse in a Medieval Tale of Risky Business|last = Miller|first = William, Ian|publisher = Brill|year = 2014|isbn = 9789004271937|location = Leiden; Boston|pages = 71–72|url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wimiller/audunmiller8.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150608090531/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wimiller/audunmiller8.pdf|archive-date = 2015-06-08|orig-year = 2008}} (Link to gratis copy, without index, from author's personal webpage.)&lt;/ref&gt; Miller further connects the root of auð to the vað in vaðmál, the woven cloth used as a type of currency in medieval Iceland, and to the spinning and weaving of fate by the [[Norns]]. Thus, Miller argues, Auðun is inherently lucky and the course of his story "exists in embryo in his name."&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:73&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller rejects scholars' two main theories of Auðun's motives for his behavior: that he is either a holy fool or acting solely out of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85&lt;/ref&gt; According to Miller, Auðun's actions are too carefully thought-out for him to be naive, and interprets the purpose of Aki's character as a demonstration that Auðun is not acting out of pure self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Miller suggests that Auðun's actions are driven by a combination of self-interest tempered with sincere, noble intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gift|Gift-giving]] and exchange are central to Auðun's Tale. Members of Old Norse society exchanged gifts with each other as a means for establishing and cementing social bonds. A gift normally carried with it an obligation to give a gift in return.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:30&lt;/ref&gt; Auðun's Tale explores the implications of gift exchange between social peers of similar standing, between lower and higher standing (such as Auðun and King Haraldr and King Sweyn), and between humans and God (Auðun going on pilgrimage to Rome). Edward G. Fichtner sees the story representing Auðun's coming of age "by his learning how to participate in the exchange of gifts in his culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fichtner |first=Edward G. |date=Summer 1979 |title=Gift Exchange and Initiation in the "Auðunar þáttr vestfirzka" |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by Irish artist [[Sir William Orpen]], exhibited in one state in 1923 and then modified in 1927.  It was one of three paintings commissioned from Orpen to commemorate the [[Versailles Peace Conference|Peace Conference]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1919.  The work is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=IWMUnknown&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20880|title=''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''|year=|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Orpen was one of the first people chosen as a [[war artist]] by the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in 1917.  Orpen was also official painter at the Versailles peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the roles of the politicians, diplomats and military at the conference, for a fee of £6,000.  The other two works, ''[[A Peace Conference at the Quai d'Orsay]]'' and ''[[The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28th June 1919]]'', are both group portraits depicting the participants at the conference.  

Orpen was deeply affected by the suffering he witnessed in France during the war, and grew to dislike the politicians at the conference.  ''To the Unknown British Soldier in France'' was originally intended to include a group of soldiers and statesmen in the Hall of Peace at the [[Palace of Versailles]], including Admirals [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]] and [[Frederick Sturdee|Sturdee]]; Field Marshals [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]], [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]] and [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer]]; Generals [[John Cowans|Cowans]], [[Arthur Currie|Currie]] and [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]; Lieutenant [[Arthur Rhys-Davids]]; [[David Lloyd George]]; [[Georges Clemenceau]], and Marshals [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] and [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]]. Orpen had completed perhaps 30 portraits before he changed his mind and painted out the faces.  Over time, the faces have now become faintly visible again under the surface of the modified work.

==Subject==
The painting measures {{convert|154.2|xx|128.9|cm|in}}.  It shows a coffin holding the remains of an [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]], [[lying in state]] in a marble hall, covered by a [[Union Flag]] and topped by a [[Brodie helmet|British helmet]], with a chandelier hanging above. A dark hallway opens up through an arched opening behind the coffin, and light is visible falling from another arched opening in the distance, with the faint outline of a cross.  The coffin is located in the Hall of Peace at the Palace of Versailles, with the Hall of Mirrors behind leading to the Hall of War.&lt;ref name=tes&gt;{{cite web |author=Helena Stride|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2090817  |title=War &amp; Peace|date=12 May 2008|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=TES Connect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of the group portrait, in the original version of the revised painting, Orpen decided to accompany the coffin with an honour guard of two emaciated soldiers, bearing guns but clad only in loin-cloths of tattered blankets.  Above, two cherubs held a floral garland that reached down to the floor.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.memorial-caen.fr/10EVENT/EXPO1418/gb/texte/097text.html|title=Art of the First World War:-''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''|year=|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed work was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1923.  It was one of the more popular exhibits with the public, but it was attacked as in poor taste by critics.  The Imperial War Museum declined to take the work on the grounds that it did not meet the terms of the commission.

Orpen later painted out the soldiers and the cherubs with their flowers, and then donated the revised painting to the Imperial War Museum in 1928 as a tribute to the late Field Marshal Haig.

'''Trajan's Column''' ({{lang-it|Colonna Traiana}}, {{lang-la|COLVMNA·TRAIANI}}) is a [[Roman triumphal column]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], that commemorates [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]]'s victory in the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] at the order of the [[Roman Senate]]. It is located in [[Trajan's Forum]], built near the [[Quirinal Hill]], north of the [[Roman Forum]]. Completed in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 113, the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral [[bas relief]], which artistically represents the wars between the Romans and [[Dacia]]ns (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous [[victory column]]s, both ancient and modern.

The structure is about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height, {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=off}} including its large [[pedestal]]. The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal [[Carrara marble]]{{efn|In ancient times, Carrara marble bore the name of ''Luna marble'' after the port of [[Luna (Etruria)|Luna]], [[Etruria]] on the harbor of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] from which it was shipped after being quarried in the mountains of [[Carrara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://class.coursera.org/romanarchitecture-001/lecture/99 | title=The Ascent of Augustus and Access to Italian Marble | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} drums, each weighing about 32 tons,&lt;ref name="Jones 1993, 32"/&gt; with a diameter of {{convert|3.7|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}. The {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid}} [[frieze]] winds around the shaft 23 times. Inside the shaft, a spiral staircase of 185 steps provides access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt;

Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird, probably an eagle,&lt;ref name="Platner"&gt;{{harvnb|Platner|1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after construction, a statue of Trajan was put in place; this statue disappeared in the [[Middle Ages]]. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by [[Pope Sixtus V]] with a bronze figure of [[St. Peter]], which remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The column was originally flanked by two libraries, which may have contained Trajan's scroll-written despatches from his [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman-Dacian Wars]]. [[Filippo Coarelli]] suggests that such scrolls are the basis both of the column's design and its spiraling, sculpted narrative. The column shows 2,662 figures, and 155 scenes; Trajan himself appears on the column 58 times.&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curry|first1=Andrew| title=Trajan's Amazing Column|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/article.html| website= National Geographic|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frieze ==

===Design===
The continuous helical frieze winds twenty-three times from base to capital, and was in its time an architectural innovation.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Sheila|title=Representation of War in Ancient Rome|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=244–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was adopted by later emperors such as Marcus Aurelius. The narrative band expands from about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=off}} at the base of the column to {{convert|1.2|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} at the top.&lt;ref&gt;Art History: Fourth Edition by Marilyn Stoksad and Michael W. Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; 
The scenes unfold continuously. Often a variety of different perspectives are used in the same scene, so that more can be revealed (''e.g.'', a different angle is used to show men working behind a wall).

===Historical content portrayed===

====Narrative====

The relief portrays Trajan's two victorious military campaigns against the [[Dacia]]ns; the lower half illustrating the first (101–102), and the top half illustrating the second (105–106). These campaigns were contemporary to the time of the Column's building. Throughout, the frieze repeats standardized scenes of imperial address (''adlocutio''), sacrifice (''lustratio''), and the army setting out on campaign (''profectio'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holscher| first=Tonio |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of battle are very much a minority on the column, instead it emphasizes images of orderly soldiers carrying out ceremony and construction.

The war against Dacia was one of conquest and expansion. Therefore, with the aim of the Dacian Campaigns being the incorporation and integration of Dacia into the Roman Empire as a Roman province, depictions of violent action towards foreign women and children are nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; Wartime violence in general seems to have been downplayed.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; 

Some scholars suggest the lack of battle scenes and large number of building scenes is a propaganda constructed specifically for the urban population of Rome (the primary audience), addressing their fear and distrust of the army by depicting its warfare as one with little collateral damage.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

Key specific events portrayed are the first crossing of the Danube by the Roman legion, Trajan's voyage up the Danube, the surrender of the Dacians at the close of the first war, the great sacrifice by the Danube bridge during the second war, the assault on the Dacian capital, and the death of the Dacian king [[Decebalus]].&lt;ref name="Trajan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trajan's Column|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/antiquity/trajans-column.htm|website=visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sections are separated by a personification of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] writing on a shield flanked on either side by Trophies.

====Figures and sets====
[[File:046 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XLVI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman carroballista, a cart-mounted field artillery weapon (relief detail)]]

Great care is taken to distinguish the men and women from both sides of the campaign as well as the ranks within these distinct groups. The scenes are crowded with sailors, soldiers, statesmen and priests, showing about 2,500 figures in all. It also exists as a valuable source of information on Roman and barbarian arms and methods of warfare (such as forts, ships, weapons, etc.) and costume. The relief shows details such as a [[ballista]] or catapult. The precise details create a strong effect of [[Effect of Reality|verisimilitude]]; the designer presents the images as objective historical truth.&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Dillon|first1=Sheila|title=Representation of War in Ancient Rome|publisher=Cambridge University Press| pages=244–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor Trajan is depicted realistically in the Veristic style, making 59 appearances as the central hero among his troops.&lt;ref name="Spiral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Spiral Frieze of Trajan's Column in Rome|url=http://www.trajans-column.org/?page_id=404|website=Trajan's Column in Rome|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of the Roman army as relatively gentle may have been designed to support Trajan's image as a man of "justice, clemency, moderation, and restraint".&lt;ref name="Spiral"/&gt;

====Women====
Women for the most part occupy and define the margins of the scenes. However, mortal females in Roman state art are so rare, it is remarkable that they are included at all in a war monument. In the male discourse of warfare, women are a visual trope that develops further the idea of subjugation by feminizing the foreign conquered.&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; 

However, on the Column is "one of the most unusual, disturbing, and violent depictions of women in Roman art, the torture scene.".&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; In this unusual scene, five Dacian women are depicted torturing three naked men, perhaps to depict female domination increasing the humiliation of the Roman enemy.

==Setting==

[[File:Trajan's column dupondius.jpg|thumb|Two examples of [[Dupondius]] struck 114-116 AD, showing Trajan's column with the original statue on top and his portrait]]

Today, the Column of Trajan is the most prominent architectural feature of Trajan’s Forum, left nearly intact but now isolated from its original setting. The Column was placed toward the northernmost point of the forum, acting as the focal point of the entire forum complex. It was surrounded on three sides by two flanking libraries and the Basilica Ulpia. The two libraries to the northeast and southwest of the Column were for the study of scrolls written in both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Hungerford Pollen, John. A Description of the Trajan Column. George E. Eyre and William Spottiswoode. Queen Victoria, London. 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; These libraries were built in tandem with the Column &lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, Lynne. (1999) Building Trajan's Column. American Journal of Archaeology 103. 3. p.419-439.&lt;/ref&gt; They apparently included upper level viewing platforms for two sides of the column. By having an elevated vantage point, the figures of the scenes, carved in shallow relief and detailed with paint and metal fittings, could be seen more closely (nevertheless it remained impossible for the ancient viewer to follow sequentially the continuous spiral of the reliefs). The problem with visibility of the upper areas is further apparent when we compare Trajan’s Column to the Column of Marcus Aurelius. The figures in the later Column of Marcus Aurelius are more deeply cut and even simplified over the height of the shaft because there were no surrounding buildings to serve as viewing platforms. The different carving style seems to have been adopted to enhance visibility.

The two libraries flanking the Column helped to further the emperor's program of propaganda. In addition to serving as viewing platforms for the Column, they housed valuable works of literature for the people of Rome.  Surely one important text kept here was Trajan's own account of the Dacian Wars, now lost.  The reliefs on the Column documenting the Dacian campaigns would have provided a vivid complement to Trajan's  account of the wars. The people of Rome were reminded of his victories every time they enjoyed the open space and amenities of the forum.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, James E., (1998) Trajan’s GLORIOUS FORUM. Archaeology. 51. 3. p 32-41&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the Column and the magnificent buildings that surrounded it created an awe inspiring spectacle.

== Purpose ==
[[File:032 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XXXII.jpg|thumb|240px|Battle scene between the Roman and Dacian armies]]

It is unclear whether the Column was meant to serve a commemorative function or as a propaganda piece. Traditional scholarship held that the Column was a glorifying monument, upholding Trajan as Rome's great emperor. However, recent reconstructions of [[Trajan's Forum]] have determined that any wide view of the Column would have been mostly obstructed by two libraries in the Forum which tightly bookended it. Also, because it would have been difficult to follow the spiral frieze from end to end (walking in circles with head inclined), the Column's narrative power would have been fairly limited.

On the other hand, as French archaeologist [[Paul Veyne]] notes, the relief could be read "vertically" from below, with the figure of the emperor recognizable across the bands of images—just as, on the [[Vendôme Column|Colonne Vendôme]], Napoleon's figure can be picked up, scene after scene. Additionally, the two libraries surrounding it provided platforms from which to observe the Column if the viewer stood on the top floors, making the complete view of frieze much more visible.

While there is certainly evidence that the Column was not put in an ideal spot for visibility, it is impossible to reject the Column as some form of a glorification structure. There is the significant point that the Column was extremely challenging to construct, and so it is unlikely that it would have been placed in the Forum with the intentions of being hidden or out of plain sight.&lt;ref name="Packer, James E 1998"&gt;Packer, James E. 01/01/1998. Archaeology: Trajan's glorious forum.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the important idea of the Column as a symbol for Trajan. Trajan’s ashes were buried in a chamber at the base of the Column. At the top of the Column was a statue of Trajan. The ground level of the Forum, which is a center of life for Romans, is where the earthly remains of Trajan are buried. The Column from the base goes up, taking us through Trajan’s triumph in the Dacian wars, and (as originally constructed) finishes with a statue of Trajan above the forum. If we consider the practice of deification of emperors, which was expected during this time period, especially of glorious Trajan, it is hard to ignore the symbolism here. Trajan’s earthly remains stay in the Forum with the Roman people, while his conquests ascend him up into the heavens. It would be hard to prove this set up as a coincidence, thus the Column should be regarded in some sense as a symbol of glorification.&lt;ref name="Packer, James E 1998"/&gt;

The Column acting as a funerary monument has also been considered. After Trajan's death in 117, the [[Roman Senate]] voted to have Trajan's ashes buried in the Column's square base, which is decorated with captured [[Dacia]]n arms and armor.  His ashes and those of his wife, [[Pompeia Plotina|Plotina]], were set inside the base in [[gold]]en urns (which later disappeared from the monument). One reading of this is that Trajan may have intended the Column to be his final resting place from the project's inception, and that the similarities in design to other funerary structures made it a natural choice for the Roman Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1997|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the circumambulation demanded of onlookers of the Column's frieze is evocative of Roman funerary practice, drawing attention toward the center – and consequently, the finial of Trajan.

Perhaps the simplest interpretation is provided by the inscription written above the entrance (translated below): that the mere existence of Column was an engineering marvel due to the immense excavation efforts necessary for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossi|1971|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inscription ==
[[File:002 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel II.jpg|thumb|240px|The inscription plate above the entrance to the interior (upper image)]]

The inscription at the base of the column in finest lettering reads:
{{quote|SENATVS·POPVLVSQVE·ROMANVS&lt;br/&gt;
IMP·CAESARI·DIVI·NERVAE·F·NERVAE&lt;br/&gt;

[[File:001 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel I.jpg|thumb|left|Trajan's Column around 1896]]

Translated, the inscription reads:

{{quote|The [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]] [give or dedicate this] to the emperor Caesar, son of the divine [[Nerva]], Nerva Traianus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus, ''[[pontifex maximus]]'', in his 17th year in the office of [[tribune]], having been acclaimed 6&amp;nbsp;times as ''[[imperium|imperator]]'', 6&amp;nbsp;times [[consul]], ''[[pater patriae]]'', to demonstrate of what great height the hill [was] and place [that] was removed for such great works.}}

It was believed that the column was supposed to stand where the saddle between the [[Capitoline]] and [[Quirinal]] Hills used to be, having been excavated by Trajan, but excavation has revealed that this is not the case. The saddle was where [[Trajan's Forum]] and [[Trajan's Market]] stood. Hence, the inscription refers to the Trajan's entire building project in the area of the [[Imperial fora]].

This is perhaps the most famous example of [[Roman square capitals]], a script often used for stone monuments and, less often, for manuscript writing. As it was meant to be read from below, the bottom letters are slightly smaller than the top letters, to give proper perspective. Some, but not all, word divisions are marked with a dot, and many of the words, especially the titles, are abbreviated. In the inscription, numerals are marked with a ''titulus'', a bar across the top of the letters. A small piece at the bottom of the inscription has been lost.

The [[typeface]] [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]], designed in 1989 by [[Carol Twombly]], uses letter forms based on this inscription, working from the research of [[Edward Catich]]. There have been many other typefaces based on the inscription from such designers as [[Frederic Goudy]] and [[Warren Chappell]].[http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/trajan/]

== Spiral stair ==
{{See also|List of ancient spiral stairs}}
[[File:Trajans-Column-lower-animated.svg|thumb|left|Section view of the pedestal and the interior stairway (click on image)]]

The interior of Trajan's Column is hollow: entered by a small doorway at one side of the base, a spiral stair of 185 steps gives access to the platform above, having offered the visitor in antiquity a view over the surrounding Trajan's forum; 43 window slits illuminate the ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|1997|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The column stands {{convert|38.4|m|1|abbr=on}} high from the ground to the top of the statue base:&lt;ref name="Lancaster 419"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located immediately next to the large [[Basilica Ulpia]], it had to be constructed sufficiently tall in order to function as a vantage point and to maintain its own visual impact on the forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column proper, that is the shaft without the pedestal, the statue and its base, is {{convert|29.76|m|ft|2|abbr=off}} high, a number which almost corresponds to 100 [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman feet]]; beginning slightly above the bottom of the base, the helical staircase inside measures a mere {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The column is composed of 29 blocks of [[Carrara marble|Luni marble]], weighing in total more than 1100&amp;nbsp;t.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 419"/&gt; The spiral stair itself was carved out of 19 blocks, with a full turn every 14 steps; this arrangement required a more complex geometry than the more usual alternatives of 12 or 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|pp=31–32, Fig. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the craftsmanship was such that the staircase is practically even, and the joints between the huge blocks still fit accurately.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous earthquakes in the past, the column today leans at an angle of less than half a degree.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"/&gt;

Trajan's Column, especially its helical stairway design, exerted a considerable influence on subsequent [[Roman architecture]]. While spiral stairs were before still a rare sight in Roman buildings, this space-saving form henceforth spread gradually throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|2002|pp=353–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the practical advantages it offered, the design also became closely associated with imperial power, being later adopted by Trajan's successors [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]. In [[Napoleon]]'s time, a similar column decorated with a spiral of relief sculpture was erected in the [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris to commemorate his victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]].

== About the Column==
{{See also|List of Roman monoliths}}
[[File:1586 Rome obelisk erection.jpg|thumb|240px|Erection of the [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in 1586 by means of a lifting tower. A similar arrangement was presumably used for the construction of Trajan's Column, but with less available space and thus manpower.]]

It is assumed that the column drums were lifted by [[crane (machine)|crane]]s into their place.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=426–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 34-36"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources, as well as a substantial body of archaeological evidence, show that [[Roman engineers]] were capable of raising large weights clear off the ground. The typical drum of Trajan's Column weighs c. 32&amp;nbsp;t,&lt;ref name="Jones 1993, 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], the heaviest block above the base and pedestal, is even at 53.3&amp;nbsp;t, which had to be lifted 34 m high.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt; To save weight, the treads had probably been carved out before either at the quarry or ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, for such loads, the typical Roman [[treadwheel]] crane, which could only reach a maximum height of {{convert|15|to(-)|18|m|ft|abbr=off}} in any event, was clearly inadequate.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt; Instead, a tower-like wooden construction was erected around the building site, in the midst of which the marble blocks were raised by a system of [[pulley]]s, ropes and [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]]; these were powered by a large workforce of men and possibly also [[draught animal]]s, spread out on the ground.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 428-437"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=428–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to modern calculations, eight capstans were needed to hoist the 55&amp;nbsp;t base block, while the length of rope required for the highest drums measured some {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr=off}} assuming two-block pulleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a lifting tower was later also used to great effect by the [[Renaissance]] architect [[Domenico Fontana]] to relocate [[obelisk]]s in Rome. From his report, it becomes obvious that the coordination of the lift between the various pulling teams required a considerable amount of concentration and discipline, since, if the force was not applied evenly, the excessive stress on the ropes would make them rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=436–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Trajan's Column, the difficulties were exacerbated even further by the simultaneous work on the neighbouring Basilica Ulpia, which limited the available space so that the capstan crews had proper access only from one side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=430–431, Fig. 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:TrajanscolumbMdCR.jpg|thumb|240px|The plaster casts laid out at eye level in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]]]]

Plaster casts of the relief were taken in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After a century of [[acid rain|acid pollution]], they are now more legible in some details than the original, and the way they are displayed offers students a closer look at the reliefs than at the original site. Examples can be studied at:

* [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] in Rome, where each "frame" of the narrative has been cut into a separate section and the sections are then displayed horizontally in order
* [[National Museum of Romanian History]], Bucharest, Romania, which displays the frieze horizontally in segments
* [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)#Trajan's Column|Cast Courts]] at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. Displayed in column form and, including the base, the column is chopped into two halves.
* [[Archaeological Collection of the University of Zürich]], [[University of Zürich]]

Additionally, individual casts of the frieze are on display in various museums, for example, in the [[:de:Museum für Antike Schiffahrt|Museum for Ancient Navigation]] in [[Mainz]]. A complete survey in [[monochrome]] was published by the German archaeologist [[Conrad Cichorius]] between 1896 and 1900 (see [[commons:Category:Trajan's Column - Cichorius Plates|Commons]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cichorius|1896|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cichorius|1900|}}&lt;/ref&gt; still forming the base of modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lepper|Frere|1988|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Cichorius's work, and on the photographic archive of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], a research-oriented Web-based viewer for Trajan's Column was created at the German-language image database.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Förtsch|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virgil Charles Aldrich''' (13 September 1903 in [[Narsinghpur]], [[British India|India]] – 28 May 1998 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]), was an American [[philosopher of art]], [[Philosophy of language|language]], and [[Philosophy of religion|religion]].

==Early life and education==
The son of Floyd Clement Aldrich and his wife Ann Hanley, Virgil Aldrich earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1925. He studied at [[Oxford University]] in 1927 and then went on to earn a ''[[Diplôme d'Études Supérieures]] de Philosophie'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1928 before completing his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of California Berkeley]] in 1931. He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich.

==Academic career==
Aldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an [[professor|instructor]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Rice University]] in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at [[Yale University]] in 1931-32. Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946. Appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1962-63. In 1965, he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he remained until his retirement in 1972.  On his retirement, he moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he became an adjunct professor at the [[University of Utah]].

Aldrich served as Director of the [[Kyoto American Studies Institute]] in [[Japan]] and for short periods was visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], and [[the University of Texas]].  He served as trustee and president of the [[American Society of Aesthetics]] and president of [[American Philosophical Association]].

=="Some Meanings of Vague" (1937)==

In his article "Some Meanings of Vague",&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis'', Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]], and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.
