      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Abraham Zevi Idelsohn''' ({{lang-he-n|אַבְרָהָם צְבִי אידלסון}} ''Avrohom Tzvi Idelsohn'' in [[Ashkenazi]] Hebrew; middle name also rendered '''''Tzvi''''', '''''Zvi''''', '''''Zwi''''', or '''''Zebi'''''; July 14, 1882 – August 14, 1938) was a prominent [[Jewish]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[musicology|musicologist]] and [[composer]], who conducted several comprehensive studies of [[Jewish music]] around the world.

Idelsohn was born in [[Feliksberg]], [[Latvia]] and trained as a [[Hazzan|cantor]]. He worked briefly in both Europe and [[South Africa]] before emigrating to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1905 and establishing a school of Jewish music there in 1919. In 1922 he moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to take a position as professor of Jewish music at [[Hebrew Union College]]. He died in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lebrecht, ''The complete companion to 20th century music'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idelsohn is generally acknowledged as the “father” of modern Jewish musicology. During his time in Jerusalem, he noted a great diversity of musical traditions among the Jews living in the region.  Idelsohn examined these traditional melodies and found recurring motifs and progressions that were not found in any other national music. This suggested a common origin for musical phrases that went back to Israel/Palestine in the first century C.E. He found that these motifs fell into three distinct tonal centers, which corresponded to the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes of the ancient Greeks. Each of these modes elicited a distinct psycho-emotional response. The Dorian Mode was used for texts of an elevated and inspired nature; the Phrygian for sentimental texts, with their very human outbreaks of feeling, both of joy and grief; and the Lydian was used in composing music for the texts of lamenting and confessions of sins. Idelsohn further categorized and defined these motives as ones that either prepared a musical phrase,  began it, or concluded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Echoes: Rediscovering Music &amp; Chant of Middle Eastern Spirituality |publisher=San Antonio Vocal Arts Ensemble. savae.org|url=http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324162522/http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works include the monumental ''Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies'' (10 volumes, 1914–1932) and ''Jewish Music'' (1929). He is considered to be the author of the lyrics of the famous Jewish [[Folk music|folk song]] "[[Hava Nagila]]."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.radiohazak.com/Havahist.html ''Who Wrote Havah Nagilah?'' at RadioHazak.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4"&gt;[[Joel Joffe]] mentioned his grandfather and his grandfather's role in writing [[Hava Nagila]] in an appearance on [http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m14s49s53&amp;SecId=53&amp;AId=56480&amp;ATypeId=1 BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Discs on 28 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the maternal grandfather of [[Joel Joffe|Joel Goodman Joffe (Baron Joffe)]].&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More evidence of the relationship between Idelsohn and Joffe is provided in [http://himelfarb.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I669&amp;tree=Markel this family tree]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2753">'''Asset health management''' or ('''AHM''') is the field of study which looks at how to manage the "health" of an [[asset]] or assets.  This often includes methods to establish asset health and effort to decide the appropriate actions to be taken to manage the assets' health. This also includes the discussion of health at end of life to ensure the asset's full life is used efficiently.

Asset health management includes many different methods which can sometime overlap in their intended scope and methods.  Asset health management has become a difficult field to discuss due to the use of the same acronym to describe multiple different approaches and the use of the same approach with different names.  

Asset health management can be considered a subset of [[Asset management]]

==Asset health management taxonomy==
Asset health management consists of multiple strategies and parts but a rough description is given as follows.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
* Asset health [[diagnostics]]
: Methods used to establish the current health of the asset
* Asset health [[prognostics]]
: Methods used to predict how the health of the asset will change in the future
* Asset health maintenance
: see [[:Category:Maintenance]]
: including [[maintenance, repair, and operations]] (better referred to as maintenance, repair,and overhaul)  These methods are used to keep an asset health, restore health to an asset or through major work restore usable life to an asset.
* Asset end of life decisions
* Asset disposal

==Management of multiple assets==
There is often also a consideration of additional work done to manage the health of multiple assets within the same framework.
Sometimes referred to as Fleet health management and falling within the study of [[Fleet management]]. Although it is common to need to manage the health of multiple assets they are not always vehicles and frequently of mixed type.

When resources are constrained it is a fascinating management problem to consider how best to manage the health of assets.  It is rare that assets can be managed in an unconstrained way  as resources are always limited by a need to make efficient use of them.

==Asset health management relevant standards==
A collection of some standards which are often use to manage the health of assets.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and will organically improve.
* [[Open O&amp;M]]
* [[MSG-3]]

==Asset health management examples==
A short list is provided to illustrate the many methods that are some sort of asset health management method or philosophy.
* [[IVHM]]
* [[Built-in_self-test]]
* [[Built-in_test_equipment]]
* [[HUMS]]

'''Berkeley Earth''' is a [[Berkeley, California]] based independent 501(c)(3) [[non-profit]] focused on land temperature data analysis for [[climate science]].  Berkeley Earth was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) with the goal of addressing the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding [[global warming]] and the [[instrumental temperature record]]. The project's stated aim was a "transparent approach, based on data analysis."&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeleyearth.org/index.php |title=Berkeley Earth home page |accessdate=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821233330/http://berkeleyearth.org/index.php |archive-date=2013-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, Berkeley Earth became an independent non-profit.  In August 2013, Berkeley Earth was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the US government. The primary product is air temperatures over land, but they also produce a global dataset resulting from a merge of their land data with HadSST.

Berkeley Earth founder [[Richard A. Muller]] told ''[[The Guardian]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we are bringing the spirit of science back to a subject that has become too argumentative and too contentious, ....we are an independent, non-political, non-partisan group. We will gather the data, do the analysis, present the results and make all of it available. There will be no spin, whatever we find. We are doing this because it is the most important project in the world today. Nothing else comes close.&lt;ref name=Sample&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/27/can-these-scientists-end-climate-change-war |title=Can a group of scientists in California end the war on climate change? |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The team's preliminary findings, data sets and programs were published beginning in December 2012. The study addressed scientific concerns including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data [[selection bias]]. The Berkeley Earth group concluded that the warming trend is real, that over the past 50 years (between the decades of the 1950s and 2000s) the land surface warmed by 0.91±0.05&amp;nbsp;°C, and their results mirror those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]],  NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, and the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]].  The study also found that the [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt;

==Initial results==
After completing the analysis of the full land temperature data set, consisting of more than 1.6 billion temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world, and originated from more than 39,000 temperature stations worldwide, the group submitted four papers for peer-review and publication in scientific journals. The Berkeley Earth study did not assess temperature changes in the oceans, nor try to assess how much of the observed warming is due to human action.&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt; The Berkeley Earth team also released the preliminary findings to the public on October 20, 2011 in order to promote additional scrutiny. The data sets and programs used to analyze the information, and the papers undergoing peer review were also made available to the public.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |first=Richard |last=Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21533360 |title=Climate change: The heat is on |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111021144716.htm |title=Cooling the Warming Debate: Major New Analysis Confirms That Global Warming Is Real |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley Earth study addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The team's initial conclusions are the following:&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/global-warming-study-climate-sceptics |title=Global warming study finds no grounds for climate sceptics' concerns |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]] and [[NASA]]'s GISS Surface Temperature Analysis. The team found that the urban heat island effect is locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to the average land temperature rise, as the planet's urban regions amount to less than 1% of the land area. The study also found that while stations considered "poor" might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend.
*Global temperatures closely matched previous studies from NASA GISS, NOAA and the Hadley Centre, that have found global warming trends. The Berkeley Earth group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911&amp;nbsp;°C, just 2% less than NOAA's estimate. The team scientific director stated that "...this confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions."&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;
*About 1/3 of temperature sites around the world with records of 70 years or longer reported cooling (including much of the United States and northern Europe). But 2/3 of the sites show warming. Individual temperature histories reported from a single location are frequently noisy and/or unreliable, and it is always necessary to compare and combine many records to understand the true pattern of global warming.
*The [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]] (AMO) has played a larger role than previously thought. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is generally thought to be the main reason for inter-annual warming or cooling, but the Berkeley Earth team's analysis found that  the global temperature correlates more closely with the state of the Atlantic Multidecadal ''Oscillation'' index, which is a measure of sea surface temperature in the north Atlantic.

The Berkeley Earth analysis uses a new methodology and was tested against much of the same data as NOAA and NASA. The group uses an algorithm that attaches an automatic weighting to every data point, according to its consistency with comparable readings. The team claims this approach allows the inclusion of outlandish readings without distorting the result and standard statistical techniques were used to remove [[outlier]]s. The methodology also avoids traditional procedures that require long, continuous data segments, thus accommodating for short sequences, such as those provided by temporary weather stations. This innovation allowed the group to compile an earlier record than its predecessors, starting from 1800, but with a high degree of uncertainty because at the time there were only two weather stations in America, just a few in Europe and one in Asia.&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature1011/&gt;

Given project leader Muller's well-publicised concerns regarding the quality of climate change research, other critics anticipated that the Berkeley Earth study would be a vindication of their stance. For example, when the study team was announced, [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]], a blogger who popularized several of the issues addressed by the Berkeley Earth group study, expressed full confidence in the team's methods:

{{quote|text=I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong. ... [T]he method ''isn't'' the madness that we've seen from NOAA, NCDC, GISS, and CRU, and, there aren't any monetary strings attached to the result that I can tell. ... That lack of strings attached to funding, plus the broad mix of people involved especially those who have previous experience in handling large data sets gives me greater confidence in the result being closer to a bona fide ground truth than anything we've seen yet.|source=Anthony Watts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/03/06/briggs-on-berkeleys-best-plus-my-thoughts-from-my-visit-there/ |last=Watts |first=Anthony |title=Briggs on Berkeley's forthcoming BEST surface temperature record, plus my thoughts from my visit there |date=March 6, 2011 |website=Watts Up With That? |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the initial results were released, and found to support the existing consensus, the study was widely decried by deniers. Watts spoke to ''The New York Times'', which wrote: "Mr. Watts ... contended that the study's methodology was flawed because it examined data over a 60-year period instead of the 30-year-one that was the basis for his research and some other peer-reviewed studies. He also noted that the report had not yet been peer-reviewed and cited spelling errors as proof of sloppiness."&lt;ref name=NYT1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/climate-study-does-not-placate-skeptics/?ref=earth |title=Climate Study Does Not Placate Skeptics |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/science/earth/21climate.html |title=Climate Skeptics Stay Unswayed |work=New York Times |date=October 21, 2011 |page=A25 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Mosher, a co-author of a book critical of climate scientists, also disapproved saying that the study still lacked transparency. He said: "I'm not happy until the code is released and released in a language that people can use freely."&lt;ref name=NYT1011/&gt; (The code and dataset were by then available from the Berkeley Earth Data page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024628/http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth Data as updated 2011-10-21], [http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth: Data Overview] (current)&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Stephen McIntyre]], editor of [[Climate Audit]], a climato-skeptics [[blog]], said that "the team deserves credit for going back to the primary data and doing the work" and even though he had not had an opportunity to read the papers in detail, he questioned the analyses of urban heating and weather station quality.&lt;ref name=Nature1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111020/full/news.2011.607.html |title=Different method, same result: global warming is real |first=Jeff |last=Tollefson |work=[[Nature News]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |doi=10.1038/news.2011.607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21074-sceptical-climate-scientists-concede-earth-has-warmed.html |title=Sceptical climate scientists concede Earth has warmed |first=Michael |last=Marshall |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the study was well received by Muller's peers in climate science research. [[James Hansen]], a leading climate scientist and head of [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] commented that he had not yet read the research papers but was glad Muller was looking at the issue. He said "It should help inform those who have honest scepticism about global warming."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] the director of the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]], said: "I look forward to reading the finalised paper once it has been reviewed and published. These initial findings are very encouraging and echo our own results and our conclusion that the impact of urban heat islands on the overall global temperature is minimal."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]], director of the Earth System Science Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]], commented that "...they get the same result that everyone else has gotten," and "that said, I think it's at least useful to see that even a critic like Muller, when he takes an honest look, finds that climate science is robust."&lt;ref name=Scientist1011/&gt; Peter Thorne, from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative, said: "This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways." &lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; The ice core research scientist Eric Steig wrote at RealClimate.org that it was unsurprising that Berkeley Earth's results matched previous results so well: "Any of various simple statistical analyses of the freely available data ...show... that it was very very unlikely that the results would change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/10/berkeley-earthquake-called-off/ |first=Eric |last=Steig |title=Berkeley earthquake called off |publisher=RealClimate.org |date=6 December 2004 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded scope==
Since the publication of its papers in 2013, Berkeley Earth has broadened its scope. Berkeley Earth has three program areas of work: 1) further scientific investigations on the nature of climate change and extreme weather events, 2) an education and communications program, and 3) evaluation of mitigation efforts in developed and developing economies, with a focus on energy conservation and the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/science Berkeley Earth  Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications Berkeley Earth  Education &amp; Communications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204083539/http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation Berkeley Earth Mitigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080520/http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 2012 announcement==
In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 28 July 2012, Muller announced further findings from the project. He said their analysis showed that average global land temperatures had increased by {{convert|2.5|F-change|1}} in 250 years, with the increase in the last 50 years being {{convert|1.5|F-change|1}}, and it seemed likely that this increase was entirely due to human caused [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. His opening paragraph stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Their analysis, set out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the [[urban heat island]] effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions. Muller said he still found "that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed."&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012" /&gt;

The theory of a '''biotic pump''' pertains to the importance of forests in the [[water cycle]], specifically, in determining the levels of rainfall a region will receive. It states that an increased amount of evaporation or [[transpiration]] will cause a reduction in atmospheric pressure as clouds form, which will subsequently cause moist air to be drawn to regions where evaporation is at its highest. In a desert this will correspond to the sea whereas in a forest, moist air from the sea will be drawn inland. The theory predicts two different types of coast to contentinental rainfall patterns, first in a forested area one can expect no decrease in rainfall as one moves inland in contrast to a deforested region where one observes an exponential decrease in annual rainfall. Whereas it is true current global climate models fit these patterns as well, it is argued this is due to [[parametrization]] and not the veracity of the theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheil|first=Douglas|last2=Murdiyarso|first2=Daniel|date=2009-04-01|title=How Forests Attract Rain: An Examination of a New Hypothesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/4/341/346941|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=341–347|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is in contradiction of the more traditional view that surface winds are solely a direct product of differences in surface heating and heat released from condensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repository.usergioarboleda.edu.co/handle/11232/397|title=How the Biotic Pump links the hydrological and the rainforest to climate : ¿Is it for real? ¿How can we prove it?|last=Bunyard|first=Peter Paul|date=2015-08-21|publisher=Universidad Sergio Arboleda|isbn=9789588745893|language=en|doi=10.22518/9789588745886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/clearing-forests-may-transform-local-and-global-climate/ |title=Clearing Forests May Transform Local—and Global—Climate |last=Schwartz |first=Judith D. |work=Scientific American |access-date=2017-12-29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the theory argue that phase changes in water play a greater role in atmospheric dynamics than currently acknowledged.

===Plant cell mechanics===
Plant cell mechanics combines principles of [[biomechanics]] and [[mechanobiology]] to investigate the growth and shaping of the plant cells. Plant cells, similar to animal cells, respond to externally applied forces, such as by reorganization of their cytoskeletal network. The presence of a considerably rigid [[extracellular matrix]], the [[cell wall]], however, bestows the plant cells with a set of particular properties. Mainly, the growth of plant cells is controlled by the mechanics and chemical composition of the cell wall. Therefore, a major part of research in plant cell mechanics is put toward the measurement and modeling of the cell wall mechanics to understand how modification of its composition and mechanical properties affects the cell function, growth and [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Bidhendi2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bidhendi|first1=Amir J|last2=Geitmann|first2=Anja|title=Relating the mechanics of the primary plant cell wall to morphogenesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-pdf/67/2/449/9366354/erv535.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|date=January 2016|volume=67|issue=2|pages=449–461|doi=10.1093/jxb/erv535|pmid=26689854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bidhendi2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bidhendi|first1=Amir J|last2=Geitmann|first2=Anja|title=Finite element modeling of shape changes in plant cells|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/176/1/41.full.pdf|journal=Plant Physiology|date=January 2018|volume=176|issue=1|pages=41-56|doi=10.1104/pp.17.01684|pmid=29229695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal Cell Mechanics ===
[[File:Animal cell structure en.svg|thumb|Animal cell structure]]
Because [[Animal cell|animal cells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McGregor |first1=Jessica |title=The Parts Of An Animal Cell |url=https://sciencetrends.com/the-parts-of-an-animal-cell/ |website=Science Trends |doi=10.31988/SciTrends.24128 |date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not have cell walls to protect them like plant cells, they require other specialized structures to sustain external mechanical forces. All animal cells are encased within a cell membrane made of a thin lipid bilayer that protects the cell from exposure to the outside environment. Using receptors composed of protein structures, the [[cell membrane]] is able to let selected molecules within the cell. Inside the cell membrane includes the [[cytoplasm]], which contains the cytoskeleton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Andrew G. |last2=Wartlick |first2=Ortrud |last3=Salbreux |first3=Guillaume |last4=Paluch |first4=Ewa K. |title=Stresses at the Cell Surface during Animal Cell Morphogenesis |url=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00351-0 |website=Current Biology |pages=R484–R494 |language=English |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.059 |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A network of filamentous proteins including [[Microtubule|microtubules]], [[Intermediate filament|intermediate filaments]], and [[Microfilament|actin filaments]] makes up the cytoskeleton and helps maintain the cell’s shape. By working together, the three types of polymers can organize themselves to counter the applied external forces and resist deformation. However, there are differences between the three polymers.



The primary structural component of the [[cytoskeleton]] is actin filaments. Being the narrowest with a diameter of 7nm and most flexible out of the three types of [[Polymer|polymers]], actin filaments are typically found at the very edge of the cytoplasm in animal cells&lt;ref name="Mo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moeendarbary |first1=Emad |last2=Harris |first2=Andrew R. |title=Cell mechanics: principles,  practices, and prospects |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269160 |website=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews. Systems Biology and Medicine |pages=371–388 |date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Formed by the linking of polymers of a protein called [[actin]], they help give cells shape and structure and are able to transport protein packages and organelles. Furthermore, actin filaments have the ability to be assembled and disassembled quickly, allowing them to take part in cell mobility&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web |title=Microtubules and Filaments |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/microtubules-and-filaments-14052932 |website=Scitable by Nature Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On the other hand, intermediate filaments are more permanent structures with a diameter of 8 to 10 nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are intermediate filaments? {{!}} MBInfo |url=https://www.mechanobio.info/cytoskeleton-dynamics/what-is-the-cytoskeleton/what-are-intermediate-filaments/ |website=www.mechanobio.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of numerous fibrous protein strands wound together, intermediate proteins’ main role is bearing tension and retaining the shape and structure of the cell by securing the nucleus and other organelles in their designated areas.

The largest cytoskeletal structure of the three types of polymers is the microtubules with a diameter of 25nm &lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;. Unlike actin filaments, microtubules are stiff, hollow structures that radiate outwards from the [[microtubule organizing center]] (MTOC). Composed of tubulin proteins, microtubules are dynamic structures that allows them to shrink or grow with the addition or removal of tubulin proteins. In terms of cell mechanics, microtubules’ main purpose is to resist compressive cellular forces and act as a transportation system for motor proteins&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;.

== Experimental Methods for Measuring Cell Mechanics ==

Because cells are tiny, soft objects that must be measured differently than materials like metal, plastic, and glass, new techniques have been developed for the accurate measurement of cell mechanics. The variety of techniques can be divided into two categories: force application techniques and force sensing techniques &lt;ref name="Mo" /&gt;.

=== Force Application Techniques ===

Force application techniques uses the cell’s response of deformation to force applied onto the cell as a way to measure traction forces&lt;ref name = "Rod"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Marita L. |last2=McGarry |first2=Patrick J. |last3=Sniadecki |first3=Nathan J. |title=Review on Cell Mechanics: Experimental and Modeling Approaches |url=http://appliedmechanicsreviews.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1882125 |website=Applied Mechanics Reviews |pages=060801–060801–41 |doi=10.1115/1.4025355 |date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several different types of force application techniques including:

# Micropipette aspiration uses applied suction pressure with a small diameter glass pipet. The measurement of the length of aspiration caused by the suction pressure can reveal several cell mechanical properties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 17: Cell Mechanics |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/courses/w3150/lecture17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Cantilever manipulation operates through an magnetic, electrical, or mechanical interaction between a probe and the surface of the cell that gives off a signal that can be used to measure mechanical properties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jalili |first1=Nader |title=Nanomechanical Cantilever-Based Manipulation for Sensing and Imaging |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-2119-1_2 |website=Nanorobotics |publisher=Springer New York |pages=29–40 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-2119-1_2 |date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Optical techniques involves the usage of trapped photons to manipulate cells. The [[Photon|photons]] will change in direction based on the cell’s refractive index, which will cause a change in momentum, leading to a force applied upon the cell&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.
# Mechanical techniques utilizes the incorporation of ferromagnetic beads into the cell or attached to specific receptors on the cell. When a magnetic force is applied, the stretch of the membrane can be measured to calculate mechanical properties&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.
# Substrate strain measures elasticity through stretching the cell. The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the cell provides information that can determine motility and adhesion&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghassemi|first=Saba|last2=Meacci|first2=Giovanni|last3=Liu|first3=Shuaimin|last4=Gondarenko|first4=Alexander A.|last5=Mathur|first5=Anurag|last6=Roca-Cusachs|first6=Pere|last7=Sheetz|first7=Michael P.|last8=Hone|first8=James|date=2012-04-03|title=Cells test substrate rigidity by local contractions on submicrometer pillars|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/14/5328|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=109|issue=14|pages=5328–5333|doi=10.1073/pnas.1119886109|issn=0027-8424|pmid=22431603}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Compression requires the usage of applied pressure onto the entire cell. By calculating the changes of the cell’s shape, compression is a way to measure mechanical responses to force&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.
# Flow Techniques uses [[Reynolds number|Reynold’s number]], a dimensionless number in fluid mechanics, to distinguish whether the cell is subject to laminar, transitional, or turbulent flow&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.

=== Force Sensing Techniques ===

# Wrinkling membranes requires putting the cell into a flexible silicon envelope. As the cell contracts, the magnitude of the forces can be estimated by utilizing the length and number of wrinkles&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.
#[[Traction force microscopy]] detects deformations through comparison of images the movement of fluorescent beads that have been adhered to the cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Plotnikov |first1=Sergey V. |last2=Sabass |first2=Benedikt |last3=Schwarz |first3=Ulrich S. |last4=Waterman |first4=Clare M. |title=High-Resolution Traction Force Microscopy |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699589/ |website=Methods in cell biology |pages=367–394 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00020-3 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Cantilever sensing can detect surface stresses with the attachment of micromechanical beams on one end of the cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Datar |first1=Ram |last2=Kim |first2=Seonghwan |last3=Jeon |first3=Sangmin |last4=Hesketh |first4=Peter |last5=Manalis |first5=Scott |last6=Boisen |first6=Anja |last7=Thundat |first7=Thomas |title=Cantilever Sensors: Nanomechanical Tools for Diagnostics |url=http://manalis-lab.mit.edu/publications/datar_MRS_2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
#[[Bioreactor|Bioreactors]] allow the measurement of multicellular forces in a three-dimensional system, while external forces are applied at the same time. This enables better results and more accurate data from complex experiments&lt;ref name="Rod" /&gt;.

== Research ==
Researchers who study cell mechanics are interested in the mechanics and dynamics of the assemblies and structures that make up the cell including membranes, [[cytoskeleton]], [[organelles]], and [[cytoplasm]], and how they interact to give rise to the emergent properties of the cell as a whole.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Daniel A|last2=Mullins|first2=Dyche|date=28 January 2010|title=Cell mechanics and the cytoskeleton|journal=Nature|volume=463|pages=485–492|doi=10.1038/nature08908|pmc=2851742|pmid=20110992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular focus of many cell mechanical studies has been the [[cytoskeleton]], which (in [[animal cells]]) can be thought to consist of:

# actomyosin assemblies ([[F-actin]], [[myosin]] motors, and associated binding, nucleating, capping, stabilizing, and crosslinking proteins),
# [[microtubules]] and their associated [[motor proteins]] ([[kinesin]]s and [[dynein]]s),
# [[intermediate filaments]],
# other assemblies such as [[spectrin]]s and [[septin]]s.

The active non-equilibrium and non-linear rheological properties of cellular assemblies have been keen point of research in recent times.&lt;ref name="Mizuno2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mizuno|first1=Daisuke|last2=Tardin|first2=Catherine|last3=Schmidt|first3=Christoph F|last4=MacKintosh|first4=Fred C|date=19 January 2007|title=Nonequilibrium mechanics of active cytoskeletal networks|journal=Science|volume=315|pages=370–373|doi=10.1126/science.1134404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Ming|last2=Ehrlicher|first2=Allen J|last3=Jensen|first3=Mikkel H|last4=Renz|first4=Malte|last5=Moore|first5=Jeffrey R|last6=Goldman|first6=Robert D|last7=Lippincott-Schwartz|first7=Jennifer|last8=Mackintosh|first8=Fred C|last9=Weitz|first9=David A|date=14 August 2014|title=Probing the stochastic, motor-driven properties of the cytoplasm using force spectrum microscopy|journal=Cell|volume=158|issue=4|pages=822–832|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.06.051|pmc=4183065|pmid=25126787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of interest has been how [[cell cycle]]-related changes in [[cytoskeletal]] activity affect global cell properties, such as intracellular pressure increase during [[mitotic cell rounding]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Martin P|last2=Helenius|first2=Jonne|last3=Toyoda|first3=Yusuke|last4=Ramanathan|first4=Subramanian P|last5=Muller|first5=Daniel J|last6=Hyman|first6=Anthony A|date=2 January 2011|title=Hydrostatic pressure and the actomyosin cortex drive mitotic cell rounding|journal=Nature|volume=469|pages=226–230|doi=10.1038/nature09642|pmid=21196934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational Heuristic Intelligence'''&lt;ref&gt;Newell, A. (1981) [http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA106557 THE HEURISTIC OF GEORGE POLYA AND ITS RELATION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE] Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;/ref&gt;(CHI) refers to specialized programming techniques in [[computational intelligence]] (also called [[artificial intelligence]], or AI). These techniques have the express goal of avoiding [[complexity]] issues, also called [[NP-hard]] problems, by using human-like techniques. They are best summarized as the use of exemplar-based methods ([[heuristics]]), rather than rule-based methods ([[algorithms]]). Hence the term is distinct from the more conventional computational ''algorithmic'' intelligence, or [[GOFAI]]. An example of a CHI technique is the [[encoding specificity principle]] of Tulving and Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., &amp; Thomson, D.M. (1973).  [http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall15/lhc/readings/TulvingThompson1973.pdf Encoding specificity and retrieval processes in episodic memory]. Psychological Review, 80, 352–373,&lt;/ref&gt; In general, CHI principles are problem solving techniques used by people, rather than programmed into machines. It is by drawing attention to this key distinction that the use of this term is justified in a field already replete with confusing neologisms. Note that the legal systems of all modern human societies employ both heuristics (generalisations of cases) from individual trial records as well as legislated statutes (rules) as regulatory guides.

Another recent approach to the avoidance of complexity issues is to employ [[feedback]] control rather than [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] modeling as a problem-solving paradigm. This approach has been called [[computational cybernetics]], because (a) the term 'computational' is associated with conventional computer programming techniques which represent a strategic, compiled, or feedforward model of the problem, and (b) the term 'cybernetic' is associated with conventional system operation techniques which represent a tactical, interpreted, or feedback model of the problem. Of course, real programs and real problems both contain both feedforward and feedback components. A real example which illustrates this point is that of human cognition, which clearly involves both perceptual ([[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], feedback, sensor-oriented) and conceptual ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]], feedforward, motor-oriented) information flows and hierarchies.

CIAM promoted  [[modern architecture]] in the "Cubist style": the [[Bauhaus]], [[Weissenhof Estate|Weissenhof]], [[De Stijl]], and modern projects of the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. Parallel movements of the 1920s include [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalism]].]]

The '''Congrès internationaux d'architecture moderne''' (CIAM), or International Congresses of [[Modern Architecture]], was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the [[Modern architecture|Modern Movement]] focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==

The International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], Hélène de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and [[Sigfried Giedion]] (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th century [[manifesto]]s meant to advance the cause of "architecture as a social art".

Other founder members included [[Karl Moser]] (first president), [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Hendrik Berlage]], [[Victor Bourgeois]], [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], Max Ernst Haefeli, [[Hugo Häring]], Arnold Höchel, Huib Hoste, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (cousin of Le Corbusier), [[André Lurçat]], [[Ernst May]], [[Max Cetto]], Fernando García Mercadal, [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Werner M. Moser]], Carlo Enrico Rava, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, [[Mart Stam]], Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were to be [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Kolli]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Other later members included [[Minnette de Silva]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Uno Åhrén]], [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] (1929) and [[Fred Forbát]]. In 1941, [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]] was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in [[New York City]].

[[Josep Lluís Sert]], co-founder of [[GATEPAC]] and [[GATCPAC]] (in [[Saragossa|Saragoza]] and [[Barcelona]], respectively) in 1930, as well as ADLAN (Friends of New Art) in Barcelona in 1932, participated in the congresses as of 1929, and served as CIAM president from 1947 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4uNElGkBoYC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=CIAM+1929+Sert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhCO-MI962&amp;sig=tWngBDDQgFw4flUp-TWeg9d851k&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6sMU8-cL_OZ0AXAj4FQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=CIAM%201929%20Sert&amp;f=false "The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960"], by Eric Paul Mumford.

==Influence==

The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through [[urban planning]].

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier's competition entry for the [[Palace of the Soviets]], a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM's principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held onboard ship, the SS Patris II, which sailed from [[Marseille]] to [[Athens]].

Here the group discussed the principles of "The Functional City", which broadened CIAM's scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the "[[Athens Charter]]."

As CIAM members traveled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following [[World War II]], although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. [[Mart Stam]]'s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an "all-out attack on the city."

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group [[Team 10]] was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob B. Bakema]]).

==CIRPAC==

In [[genetics]], a '''deletion''' (also called '''gene deletion''', '''deficiency''', or '''deletion mutation''') (sign: [[delta (letter)|Δ]]) is a [[mutation]] (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a [[chromosome]] or a sequence of [[DNA]] is lost during DNA replication. Any number of [[nucleotide]]s can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=R. |title=Human Genetics: Concepts and Applications |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0072951745 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest single base deletion mutations are believed to occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site.&lt;ref&gt;Banavali, Nilesh K. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja401573j "Partial base flipping is sufficient for strand slippage near DNA duplex termini."] Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2013, 135(22), 8274-8282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banavali, Nilesh K. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp408957c "Analyzing the Relationship between Single Base Flipping and Strand Slippage near DNA Duplex Termini."] Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2013, 117(46), 14320-14328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manjari, Swati R., Pata, Janice D., Banavali, Nilesh K. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi500189g "Cytosine Unstacking and Strand Slippage at an Insertion–Deletion Mutation Sequence in an Overhang-Containing DNA Duplex."] Biochemistry, 2014, 53(23), 3807-3816.&lt;/ref&gt; Deletions can be caused  by errors in [[chromosomal crossover]] during [[meiosis]], which causes several serious [[genetic disease]]s. Deletions that do not occur in multiples of three bases can cause a [[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]] by changing the 3-nucleotide protein reading frame of the genetic sequence. The examples are given below of types and effects of deletions are representative of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, particularly humans, but are not relevant to [[prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria.

==Causes==
Causes include the following:
* Losses from [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]
* [[Chromosomal crossover]]s within a [[chromosomal inversion]]
* [[Unequal crossing over]]
* Breaking without rejoining

For [[synapsis]] to occur between a chromosome with a large intercalary deficiency and a normal complete homolog, the unpaired region of the normal homolog must loop out of the linear structure into a '''deletion''' or '''compensation loop'''.

==Types==
Types of deletion include the following:
*''''''Terminal Deletion'''''' — a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome.
*'''Intercalary Deletion / Interstitial Addition''' — a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome.
*'''Micro-deletion''' — a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5Mb that could include a dozen genes).

Micro-deletion is usually found in children with physical abnormalities. A large amount of deletion would result in immediate abortion (miscarriage).

==Effects==

Small deletions are less likely to be fatal; large deletions are usually fatal — there are always variations based on which genes are lost.  Some medium-sized deletions lead to recognizable human disorders, e.g. [[Williams syndrome]].

Deletion of a number of pairs that is not evenly divisible by three will lead to a [[frameshift mutation]], causing all of the [[codon]]s occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during [[translation (genetics)|translation]], producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional [[protein]]. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an ''in-frame'' deletion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms LSDB — Controlled vocabulary terms] at The GEN2PHEN Knowledge Centre. Posted Fri, 08/01/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male [[infertility]] and two thirds of cases of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;  Deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5 results in [[Cri du chat]] syndrome.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;  Deletions in the [[survival motor neuron|SMN]]-encoding gene cause [[spinal muscular atrophy]], the most common genetic cause of infant death.

Recent work suggests that some deletions of highly conserved sequences (CONDELs) may be responsible for the evolutionary differences present among closely related species. Such deletions in humans are referred to as [[hCONDELs]] may be responsible for the anatomical and behavioral differences between humans, [[Chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] and other varieties of  mammals like [[ape]] or [[Monkey|monkeys.]]&lt;ref name="McLeanCory"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McLean CY, Reno PL, Pollen AA, Bassan AI, Capellini TD, Guenther C, Indjeian VB, Lim X, Menke DB, Schaar BT, Wenger AM, Bejerano G, Kingsley DM |title=Human-specific loss of regulatory DNA and the evolution of human-specific traits |journal=Nature |volume=471 |issue=7337 |pages=216–9 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21390129 |pmc=3071156 |doi=10.1038/nature09774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==

The introduction of molecular techniques in conjunction with classical cytogenetic methods has in recent years greatly improved the diagnostic potential for chromosomal abnormalities. In particular, microarray-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) based on the use of BAC clones promises a sensitive strategy for the detection of DNA copy-number changes on a genome-wide scale. The resolution of detection could be as high as &gt;30,000 "bands" and the size of chromosomal deletion detected could as small as 5–20 kb in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=H|title=BAC-based PCR fragment microarray: high-resolution detection of chromosomal deletion and duplication breakpoints|journal=Human Mutation|date=May 2005|volume=25|issue=5|pages=476–482|pmid=15832308|doi=10.1002/humu.20164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other computation methods were selected to discover DNA sequencing deletion errors such as [[end-sequence profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/VOM_EST.pdf |title=Using a VOM Model for Reconstructing Potential Coding Regions in EST Sequences |last=Shmilovici |first=A. |last2=Ben-Gal |first2=I. |journal=Journal of Computational Statistics |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=49–69 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s00180-007-0021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volik|first1=S.|last2=Zhao|first2=S.|last3=Chin|first3=K.|last4=Brebner|first4=J.

A '''developed  country''', '''industrialized country''', '''more developed country''', or '''more economically developed country''' ('''MEDC'''), is a [[sovereign state]] that has a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), [[gross national product]] (GNP), the [[per capita income]], level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp#axzz1legO8olO Developed Economy Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322201145/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp |date=22 March 2016 }}. Investopedia (16 April 2010). Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate.

Developed countries have generally [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] economies, meaning the [[service sector]] provides more wealth than the [[industrial sector]]. They are contrasted with [[developing country|developing countries]], which are in the process of [[industrialization]] or pre-industrial and almost entirely [[Agriculture|agrarian]], some of which might fall into the category of [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]. As of 2015, advanced economies comprise 60.8% of global GDP based on [[nominal value]]s and 42.9% of global GDP based on [[purchasing power parity|purchasing-power parity]] (PPP) according to the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 IMF GDP data (October 2015)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041611/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the ten largest advanced economies by GDP in both nominal and PPP terms were [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weoselco.aspx?g=110&amp;sg=All+countries+/+Advanced+economies|title=All countries/Advanced economies|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms linked to the concept ''developed country'' include "advanced country", "industrialized country", "'more developed country" (MDC), "more economically developed country" (MEDC), "[[Global North]] country", "[[First World|first world]] country", and "post-industrial country". The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as [[industrialization]] is an ongoing process that is hard to define.  The first industrialized country was the [[United Kingdom]], followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[France]] and other [[Western Europe]]an countries. According to some [[economist]]s such as [[Jeffrey Sachs]], however, the current divide between the developed and [[Developing country|developing world]] is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.&lt;!--

==Definition and criteria==
Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is income per capita; countries with high [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries.  Another economic criterion is [[industrialization]]; countries in which the [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary sectors of industry]] dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently another measure, the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating.  The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the [[List of countries by wealth per adult|net wealth per capita]] or the relative [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the [[G7]] members and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2D0AAAAMAAJ|title=The Courier|date=1994|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/human-development-index/|title=Human development index - Economics  Help|work=Economics  Help|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the [[United Nations]] system.&lt;ref name="unstated.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Millennium Development Indicators: World and regional groupings |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |date=2003 |at=Note b |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210031555/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |archivedate=10 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Development Index (HDI)==
{{Main article|Human Development Index|List of countries by Human Development Index}}
The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges a country's level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned "into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development."

Since 1990, [[Norway]] (2001–2006, 2009–2017), [[Japan]] (1990–1991 and 1993), [[Canada]] (1992 and 1994–2000) and [[Iceland]] (2007–2008) have had the highest HDI score.

As a non-UN member, the government of [[Taiwan]] calculates its own HDI, which had a value of 0.882 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.tw/public/Data/1112116124371.pdf|format=PDF|title=2011中華民國人類發展指數 (HDI)|accessdate=21 November 2011|year=2011|publisher=Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.|language=Chinese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226052702/http://www.stat.gov.tw/public/Data/1112116124371.pdf|archivedate=26 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while the HDI for the Chinese [[special administrative region]] of Hong Kong is calculated by the UN, it is not for [[Macau]]. The Macanese government calculated the territory's HDI to be 0.868 in 2011. These values place both Taiwan and Macau well within the list of countries with "Very high human development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/1310df1c-dce8-4ff6-ba83-4a56ad187ca2/E_MN_PUB_2013_Y.aspx Macau in Figures, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024055449/http://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/1310df1c-dce8-4ff6-ba83-4a56ad187ca2/E_MN_PUB_2013_Y.aspx |date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2009 a United Nations project calculated the HDI for all of its members, as well as Taiwan, Macau, and many [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]. The HDI values for the countries of [[San Marino]] and [[Monaco]], which have not been included in official annual HDI reports, were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively. This places both countries firmly within the category of countries with "Very high human development" as well. The dependent territories with HDI values equivalent to "Very high human development" were: [[Jersey]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Bermuda]], [[Guernsey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Isle of Man]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Aruba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Martinique]], [[Greenland]], and [[Guam]].&lt;ref name="UN Escap"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/wp-09-02.pdf Filling Gaps in the Human Development Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012014/http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/wp-09-02.pdf |date=5 March 2016 }}, United Nations ESCAP, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, the HDI values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old HDI formula, while HDI values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula.

==High-income economies==
Some institutions have produced lists of developed countries: the UN (list shown above), the CIA,&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-b.html|title=Appendix B.

{{Anthropology |concepts}}

'''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[Applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term ''development'' refers to the social action made by different agents (e.g. [[institution]]s, [[business]]es, [[State (polity)|states]], or independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the [[Economy|economic]], technical, political, or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in [[Poverty|impoverished]], formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer [[Western culture|Western]] projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most [[Marginalization|marginalized]], and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the [[anthropology of development]] (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With researches on the field, the anthropologist can describe, analyze, and understand the different actions of development that took and take place in a given place. The various impacts on the local population, environment, society, and economy are to be examined.

==History==

In 1971, Glynn Cochrane proposed development anthropology as a new field for practitioners interested in a career outside academia.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Development Anthropology'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, (ed.) ''What can we do for each other, An Interdisciplinary Approach to Development Anthropology'', (Amsterdam: Grüner, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the growing complexity of development assistance, Cochrane suggested that graduates needed to prepare themselves to work in interdisciplinary settings.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, "Policy Studies and Anthropology", in ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 21, No., 4, August, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Cochrane was invited by the [[World Bank]] to make recommendations for the use of anthropology, and his report&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Use of Anthropology in Project Operations of the World Bank Group'', (World Bank/IMF, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; (which stressed the need for the systematic treatment of social issues) laid a foundation for future use of the discipline in the [[World Bank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goodlund, ''Social and Environmental Assessment to Promote Sustainability, an Informal View from the World Bank'', (Glasgow: International Association for Impact Assessment, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Around ninety anthropologists are now employed by the World Bank Group in various roles.

In 1974, Bob Berg—of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID)—and Cochrane worked together, and, as a result, USAID introduced "social soundness analysis" as a project preparation requirement. This innovation led to the employment of more than seventy anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hoben, "Anthropologists and Development", in ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 11: 349-375 (Volume publication date October 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Cultural Appraisal of Development Projects'', (New York: Praeger, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Social soundness analysis has now been in USAID use for over forty years. USAID ran an in-house development studies course in the 1970s, through which several hundred field personnel eventually passed. In addition to anthropology, the course covered development [[economics]], regional and national planning, and institution building.

In the late 1970s, Thayer Scudder, Michael Horowitz,  and David Brokensha established an Institute for Development Anthropology at the [[State University of New York]] at Binghamton. This institute has played an influential role in the continuing expansion of this branch of the discipline.

By the 1980s and 1990s, development anthropology began to be more widely used in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Festival Elephants and the Myth of Global Poverty'', (New York: Pearson, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate social responsibility and issues ranging from resettlement and [[human rights]] to [[micro-enterprise]] are now routinely addressed by systematic social assessment as an integral part of investment appraisal.

==Development criticism==
{{see also|Development criticism}}

Criticism of Western development became an important goal in the late 1980s, after the wake of severe economic crisis brought disease, poverty, and [[starvation]] to countries and sectors that were the focus of large Western [[structural adjustment]] development projects throughout [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and other parts of the former colonial world. Despite the failure of many of these development projects, and some 40 years of post [[World War II]] funding from the US and Europe, scholars know{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} that development has been the key way that Western post-industrialized countries intervene in non-Western society. Development criticism seeks to discover why, given the funds and best intentions of volunteers and policy makers, do the majority of development projects continue to fail to (1) redistribute economic power and resources in a way that helps the poorest sectors of society, and (2) to create economic growth that is sustainable in the country.

Anthropologists who study development projects themselves have criticized the fundamental structure of Western development projects coming from such institutions as USAID and bilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Because they are often working from the perspective of the objects of development in the non-Western world, rather than from within the aid institutions, anthropologists encountering such projects have a unique perspective from which to see the problems. Anthropologists write with concern about the ways that non-Western objects of aid have been left out of the widespread drive to develop after World War II, especially in the ways that such projects limit solutions to poverty in the form of narrow Western [[Capitalism|capitalist]] models that promote exploitation and the destruction of household farms, or, more suspiciously, naturalise inequality between Western post-industrialized countries and former colonial subjects.

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers; however, they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that [[sustainable development]] requires at the very least more involvement of the people who the project aims to target in the project's creation, its management, and its decision-making processes.

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]]'s seminal book ''[[Encountering Development]]'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples and enacted an [[Orientalism]] (see [[Edward Said]]). Escobar&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Escobar, 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; even sees international development as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of former colonies. Escobar shows that, between 1945 and 1960, the former colonies were going through the [[decolonization]] era, and the development plan helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]]. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of World War II, and during the [[Cold War]], when they were developed to (1) stop the spread of [[communism]] with the spread of capitalist markets, and (2) create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by [[Michel Foucault]] and other [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]].

More recent studies like [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]]'s ''[[The Anti-Politics Machine]]'' argue that the ideas and institutional structure that support Western development projects are fundamentally flawed because of the way the West continues to represent the former colonial world. International development uses an "anti-politics" that ultimately produces failure, despite the best intentions. Finally, studies also point out how development efforts often attempt to de-politicize change by a focus on instrumental assistance (like a school building) but not on the objective conditions that led to the development failure (e.g., the state's neglect of rural children at the expense of urban elite), nor the content of what the school might or might not teach. In this sense, the critique of international development focuses on the insidious effects of projects that at the least offer band-aids that address symptoms but not causes, and that at the worst promote projects that systematically redirect economic resources and profit to the West.

== Applied anthropology in development ==
While anthropological studies critique the Western assumptions and political context of development projects, anthropologists also consult on and work within aid institutions in the creation and implementation of development projects. While economists look at aggregate measures like [[gross national product]] and [[per capita income]], as well as measures of [[income distribution]] and [[economic inequality]] in a society, anthropologists can provide a more fine-grained analysis of the qualitative information behind these numbers, such as the nature of the social groups involved and the social significance of the composition of income. Thus, development anthropologists often deal with assessing the important qualitative aspects of development sometimes ignored by an economic approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''Diatonic set theory''' is a subdivision or application of [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] which applies the techniques and [[musical analysis|insights]] of [[discrete mathematics]] to properties of the [[diatonic collection]] such as [[maximal evenness]], [[Myhill's property]], [[well formed generated collection|well formedness]], the [[deep scale property]], [[cardinality equals variety]], and [[structure implies multiplicity]]. The name is something of a misnomer as the concepts involved usually apply much more generally, to any periodically repeating scale.

Music theorists working in diatonic set theory include [[Eytan Agmon]], [[Gerald J. Balzano]], [[Norman Carey]], [[David Clampitt]], [[John Clough (music theorist)|John Clough]], [[Jay Rahn]], and mathematician [[Jack Douthett]]. A number of key concepts were first formulated by [[David Rothenberg]], who published in the journal ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', and [[Erv Wilson]], working entirely outside of the academic world.

A '''differentiable neural computer''' ('''DNC''') is a [[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] [[artificial neural network]] architecture with an [[autoassociative memory]]. The model was published in 2016 by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] et al. of [[DeepMind]].&lt;ref name="DNCnature2016"/&gt;

== Applications ==

So far, DNCs have only been demonstrated to handle relatively simple tasks, which could have been easily solved using conventional computer programming decades ago. But DNCs don't need to be programmed for each problem they are applied to, but can instead be trained. This attention span allows the user to feed complex [[data structure]]s such as [[Graph (abstract data type)|graphs]] sequentially, and recall them during later use. Furthermore, they can learn some aspects of [[Symbolic Reasoning|symbolic reasoning]] and apply it to the use of working memory. Some experts see promise that they can be trained to perform complex, structured tasks&lt;ref name="DNCnature2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|last2=Wayne|first2=Greg|last3=Reynolds|first3=Malcolm|last4=Harley|first4=Tim|last5=Danihelka|first5=Ivo|last6=Grabska-Barwińska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Colmenarejo|first7=Sergio Gómez|last8=Grefenstette|first8=Edward|last9=Ramalho|first9=Tiago|date=2016-10-12|title=Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101.epdf?author_access_token=ImTXBI8aWbYxYQ51Plys8NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MggmpDmwljGswxVdeocYSurJ3hxupzWuRNeGvvXnoO8o4jTJcnAyhGuZzXJ1GEaD-Z7E6X_a9R-xqJ9TfJWBqz|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=538|issue=7626|doi=10.1038/nature20101|issn=1476-4687|pages=471–476|pmid=27732574|bibcode=2016Natur.538..471G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/|title=Differentiable neural computers {{!}} DeepMind|website=DeepMind|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and address big-data applications that require some sort of rational reasoning, such as generating video commentaries or semantic text analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaeger|first=Herbert|date=2016-10-12|title=Artificial intelligence: Deep neural reasoning|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19477.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=538|issue=7626|doi=10.1038/nature19477|issn=1476-4687|pages=467–468|pmid=27732576|bibcode=2016Natur.538..467J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNC can be trained to navigate a variety of [[rapid transit]] systems, and then what the DNC learns can be applied, for example, to get around on the [[London Underground]]. A neural network without memory would typically have to learn about each different transit system from scratch. On graph traversal and sequence-processing tasks with [[supervised learning]], DNCs performed better than alternatives such as [[long short-term memory]] or a neural turing machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With a [[reinforcement learning]] approach to a block puzzle problem inspired by [[SHRDLU]], DNC was trained via curriculum learning, and learned to make a [[Automated planning and scheduling|plan]]. It performed better than a traditional [[recurrent neural network]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Architecture ==

[[File:Differentiable Neural Computer.png|thumb|DNC system diagram.]]

DNC networks were introduced as an extension of the [[Neural Turing Machine]] (NTM), with the addition of memory attention mechanisms that control where the memory is stored, and temporal attention that records the order of events. This structure allows DNCs to be more robust and abstract than a NTM, and still perform tasks that have longer-term dependencies than some of its predecessors such as the [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] network. The memory, which is simply a matrix, can be allocated dynamically and accessed indefinitely. The DNC is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] end-to-end (each subcomponent of the model is differentiable, therefore so is the whole model). This makes it possible to optimize them efficiently using [[gradient descent]]. It learns how to store and retrieve the information such that it satisfies the task execution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-ai-tube-london-underground|title=DeepMind's AI learned to ride the London Underground using human-like reason and memory|last=Burgess|first=Matt|newspaper=WIRED UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/348701/deepmind-ai-learns-to-navigate-london-tube|title=DeepMind AI 'Learns' to Navigate London Tube|newspaper=PCMAG|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/__trashed-2/|title=DeepMind's differentiable neural computer helps you navigate the subway with its memory|last=Mannes|first=John|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNC model is similar to the [[Von Neumann architecture]], and because of the resizability of memory, it is [[Turing complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=steioHoiEms?t=721|title=RNN Symposium 2016: Alex Graves - Differentiable Neural Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiable Neural Computers were inspired by the mammalian [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/10174-deepminds-differential-nn-thinks-deeply.html|title=DeepMind's Differentiable Neural Network Thinks Deeply|last=James|first=Mike|date=|website=www.i-programmer.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refinements to the model have been published since the original paper's release. Sparse memory addressing results in a time and space complexity reduction of thousands of times. This can be achieved by using an approximate nearest neighbors algorithm, such as [[Locality-sensitive hashing]], or a random [[k-d tree]] like the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors from [[University of British Columbia|UBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1610.09027|title=Scaling Memory-Augmented Neural Networks with Sparse Reads and Writes|author1=Jack W Rae|author2=Jonathan J Hunt|last3=Harley|first3=Tim|last4=Danihelka|first4=Ivo|last5=Senior|first5=Andrew|last6=Wayne|first6=Greg|last7=Graves|first7=Alex|author8=Timothy P Lillicrap|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) separates computation time from data time, which uses the fact that problem length and problem difficulty are not always the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1603.08983|title=Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|class=cs.NE|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training using synthetic gradients performs considerably better than [[Backpropagation through time]] (BPTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1608.05343|title=Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients|last1=Jaderberg|first1=Max|author2=Wojciech Marian Czarnecki|last3=Osindero|first3=Simon|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|last5=Graves|first5=Alex|last6=Silver|first6=David|last7=Kavukcuoglu|first7=Koray|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another training improvement in terms of robustness can be achieved with use of DNA normalization and a Bypass Dropout as regularization. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1807.02658|title=Robust and Scalable Differentiable Neural Computer for Question Answering|last1=Franke|first1=Jörg|last2=Niehues|first2=Jan|last3=Waibel|first3=Alex|class=cs.CL|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct Behavior Rating''' ('''DBR''') is a [[behavior]] [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] method that educational professionals, such as [[school psychologist]]s and [[teacher]]s, use to monitor student behavior. It is characterized by:
* Recording a rating immediately after a specified observation period
* Using a rater with firsthand experience with the rated individual for the duration of the observation period (e.g., a teacher in a classroom where one student is the target)
* Requiring "minimal inference" from the rater to discern relevant behaviors&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Christ, T.J. |year=2009 |title=Direct Behavior Rating (DBR): An emerging method for assessing social behavior within a tiered intervention system |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=195–200 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a teacher was concerned about a student's disruptive behavior during [[math]] class and wanted to collect data on their behavior, they could explicitly define "disruptive behavior", observe the student's behavior during typical math instruction, and at the end of class, record for what percentage of time the student displayed disruptive behavior. This is an example of DBR using a Single Item Scale, or DBR-SIS.

Direct Behavior Rating typically involves four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sugai G. |year=2007 |title=School Based Behavior Assessment: Informing Instruction and Intervention |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafouleas |first=S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=McDougal, J.|year=2002|title=Good, bad, or in-between: How does the daily behavior report card rate? |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=39 |pages=157–169 |doi=10.1002/pits.10027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Specify a target behavior to monitor
# Rate that behavior after a specific [[observation]] period
# Share the information with concerned individuals (e.g., [[parent]]s, teachers, [[student]]s)
# Use [[outcome data]] to monitor the target behavior over time 

Direct Behavior Rating represents an amalgamation of characteristics from two major types of behavior collection systems: systematic direct observation and behavior rating scales.&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt; According to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] performed in 2006, over 60% of classroom teachers report that they employ DBR or DBR-like tools within their [[classroom]]s and view it as a highly acceptable intervention tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sassu, K.A. |year=2006 |title=Acceptability and reported use of Daily Behavior Report Cards among teachers |journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions |volume=8 |pages=174–182 |doi=10.1177/10983007060080030601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[research]] further indicates the acceptability of the measure to school psychologists who are frequently responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of research-based classroom interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author2=Chafouleas, S.M. |author3=Eckert, T. |year=2008 |title=Daily Behavior Report Cards and Systematic Direct Observation: An Investigation of the Acceptability, Reported Training and Use, and Decision Reliability among School Psychologists |journal= Journal of Behavioral Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DBR is not restricted to a single form of assessment. Rather, it is a methodology that can be used with a wide range of behaviors, contexts, and applications. One common distinction is made between DBR scales that consist of solely one item representing a behavioral construct (i.e., disruptive behavior) (Single Item Scales, or DBR-SIS) and those that consist of multiple items that are individually scored and then aggregated to depict a single construct (i.e., "Inappropriately calls out during instruction," "Pokes other students during instruction") (Multiple Item Scales, or DBR-MIS).&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christ, T.J. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Chafouleas, S.M. |year=2009 |title=Foundation for the development and use of Direct Behavior Rating (DBR) to assess and evaluate student behavior |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=201–213 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of DBR research has focused on the Single Item Scale format, the content of which is intended to be flexibly determined based on the rating's context and then graphed and summarized independently of other Single Item Scales. While each DBR-SIS individually measures a single behavioral construct, the utility of using multiple Single Item Scales as general outcome measures for school-based social behavior has also been examined.&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"/&gt;

Research has also investigated the feasibility of incorporating DBR into intervention packages. One study used DBR as a combined intervention and assessment tool through its use as a [[self-monitoring]] intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gureasko-Moore, S.P. |author2=DuPaul, G.J. |author3=White, G. |year=2007 |title=Self-management of classroom preparedness and homework: Effects on school functioning of adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |pages=647–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature examining the use of daily behavior report cards or daily progress reports often use DBR methodology as an integral part of their intervention and assessment construction. More resources regarding behavior report cards are available at:

* [http://ccf.buffalo.edu/resources_downloads.php Daily Report Card resources] from the [http://ccf.buffalo.edu/ Center for Children and Families] at the [http://www.buffalo.edu/ University at Buffalo]

Given its promising [[psychometric]] properties, contextual relevance, and usability by practitioners with restricted resources (e.g., teachers), DBR has also been suggested as a possible assessment tool within multi-tiered intervention frameworks such as [[Response to Intervention]].&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">'''Drum replacement''' is the practice, in modern music production, of an engineer or producer recording a live drummer and replacing (or adding to) the sound of a particular drum with a pre-recorded sample. For example, a drummer might play a beat, whereupon the engineer might then replace all of the snare hits with the sound of a hand-clap. It is considered by some to be one of the most arcane practices of the modern music production industry {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} and is an example of the considerable influence of computers in modern music, even in genres not strictly classified as "[[electronic music]]."

== Origins ==
The practice is an extension of the recording techniques of the 1970s through to the 1980s, wherein the constant search for better or "more perfect" sound led to a variety of techniques being tested, including the extensive use of drum machines. Among  these techniques was drum replacement, which was pioneered by producer [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] while in the studio with [[Steely Dan]] in the late '70s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/tutorials/emusic_drum_replacement_primer/ : Drum Replacement 101 offers the basics for replacing drums in the personal studio | Basic drum replacement techniques, how to&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown in both popularity and complexity since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?navid=52&amp;itemid=23683&amp;langid=1&amp;ref=DN0906 Digidesign | News | Partner News | Roger Nichols Digital Unveils Universal Binary Versions of Pro Tools plug-ins for Intel-based Macintosh Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common uses of this technique is the replacing of every snare hit in a performance (which may or may not sound subjectively "good") with an "ideal" snare drum hit.
Should the decision be made to use drum replacement techniques, the actual implementation of the practice usually falls to an audio engineer during the mixing stage.

== Association ==
Drum replacing is often mentioned, along with [[autotune]], harmonizers, and advanced compressors, as being symptomatic of the "artificial nature" of modern western music by certain critics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Some critics suggest that the practice defeats the purpose of having a live drummer as opposed to a drum machine, since the end result is effectively exactly the same as what a drum machine would produce if the drum machine had a custom sample recorded for it by the engineer. Others laud it as one of the subtleties of studio technique, used by engineers to give their craft more complexity in an increasingly automated world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">'''Ecological triage''' refers to the decision-making of environmental conservation using the concepts of medical [[triage]]. In medicine, the allocation of resources in an urgent situation is prioritized for those with the greatest need and those who would receive the greatest benefit. Similarly, the two parameters of ecological triage are the level of threat and the probability of recovery. Because there are limitations to resources such as time, money, and manpower, it is important to prioritize specific efforts and distribute resources efficiently. Ecological triage differentiates between areas with an attainable emergent need, those who would benefit from preventative measures, and those that are beyond repair.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Richard J.|last2=Kristjanson|first2=Linda J.|date=2003-02-01|title=Triage: How do we prioritize health care for landscapes?|journal=Ecological Management &amp; Restoration|language=en|volume=4|pages=S39–S45|doi=10.1046/j.1442-8903.4.s.5.x|issn=1442-8903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Ecological triage is not simple, dichotomous decision making. It involves an array of complex factors including assumptions, mathematical calculations, and planning for uncertainties. When assessing an ecosystem, there are a myriad of factors conservationists consider, but there are also variables which they are unable to account for. Conservationists and scientists often have incomplete understanding of population dynamics, impacts of external threats, and efficacy of different conservation tactics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald-Madden|first=Eve|last2=Baxter|first2=Peter W.J.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2008-12-01|title=Making robust decisions for conservation with restricted money and knowledge|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1630–1638|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01553.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to incorporate these unknowns when assessing a population or ecosystem. By following the principles of triage, we are able to allow for the efficient allocation of resources as conservationists continue to develop the best options for ecological preservation and restoration.

=== Info-Gap Decision Model&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
Due to the multitude of variables within a population or ecosystem, it is important to address the unknown factors which may not initially be accounted for. Many ecologists utilize the [[Info-gap decision theory]], which focuses on strategies that are most likely to succeed despite uncertainties. This process is composed of three main elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgman|first=M. A.|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=D. B.|last3=Elith|first3=J.|date=2005-08-01|title=Managing Landscapes for Conservation Under Uncertainty|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=86|issue=8|pages=2007–2017|doi=10.1890/04-0906|issn=1939-9170|citeseerx=10.1.1.477.4238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Mathematical calculations which assess performance as a result of management.''' This step determines the number of management options, evaluates the existing subpopulations, estimates the management period, and assesses the impact of inaction. 
# '''Expectations of performance.''' To evaluate performance, an extinction-investment curve is utilized. It evaluates data regarding the probability of species extinction (without intervention), budget allocation, and budget required to halve probability of extinction. This step sets forth a threshold below which performance is considered unacceptable. 
# '''A model describing uncertainty.''' The [[Info-gap decision theory#Uncertainty models|uncertainty model]] examines the possible values which may render the extinction-investment curve incorrect. It considers how factors may vary in dynamic situations and creates a function of uncertainty.                              

== Criticisms ==
Some critics of environmental triage believe the process chooses "winners" and "losers" and therefore abandons certain demographics. Other criticism argues that ecological triage allows for the government to justify under-funding environmental programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pannelldiscussions.net/2014/03/262/|title=Pannell Discussions " 262 – Environmental triage|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By utilizing a formal decision-making model, the government can deem certain projects as a lost cause and choose to withhold funding. Critics and supporters alike stress the necessity of expanding the environmental budget to provide the best conservation and restoration efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">'''Fermentative hydrogen production''' is the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrates to [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Hydrogen produced in this manner is often called [[biohydrogen]].  The conversion is effected by [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]], which employ [[enzyme]]s.  Fermentative hydrogen production is one of several [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]s. 

==Dark vs photofermentation==
[[Dark fermentation]] reactions do not require light energy.  These are capable of constantly producing [[hydrogen]] from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Typically these reactions are coupled to the formation of carbon dioxide or formate.  Important reactions that result in hydrogen production start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exegonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

Using [[synthetic biology]], bacteria can be genetically altered to enhance this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163896478.html Synthetic biology and hydrogen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/19/chemistry.agriculture | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Chris | last=Edwards | title=Synthetic biology aims to solve energy conundrum | date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photofermentation]] differs from [[dark fermentation]], because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]]. [[Electrohydrogenesis]] is used in [[microbial fuel cell]]s.

==Bacteria strains==
For example photo-fermentation with ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]'' SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18477081 High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterobacter aerogenes'' is an outstanding hydrogen producer. It is an anaerobic facultative and mesophilic bacterium that is able to consume different sugars and in contrast to cultivation of strict anaerobes, no special operation is required to remove all oxygen from the fermenter. ''E. aerogenes'' has a short doubling time and high hydrogen productivity and evolution rate. Furthermore, hydrogen production by this bacterium is not inhibited at high hydrogen partial pressures; however, its yield is lower compared to strict anaerobes like ''Clostridia''. A theoretical maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose can be produced by strict anaerobic bacteria. Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as ''E. aerogenes'' have a theoretical maximum yield of 2&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flexible electronics''', also known as ''flex circuits'', is a [[technology]] for assembling [[electronic circuit]]s by mounting electronic devices on [[Flexibility|flexible]] [[plastic]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s, such as [[polyimide]], [[PEEK]] or transparent conductive polyester&lt;ref&gt;D. Shavit: The developments of LEDs and SMD Electronics on transparent conductive Polyester film, Vacuum International, 1/2007, S. 35 ff&lt;/ref&gt; film. Additionally, flex circuits can be [[screen printing|screen printed]] silver circuits on [[polyester]]. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid [[printed circuit board]]s, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as [[flexible silicon]] (~ 5&amp;nbsp;mm bending radius).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Alfaraj|first2=Nasir|last3=Torres-Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Fahad|first4=Hossain M.|last5=Hussain|first5=Muhammad M.|title=Out-of-Plane Strain Effects on Physically Flexible FinFET CMOS|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=July 2016|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2657–2664|doi=10.1109/TED.2016.2561239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfaraj|first1=Nasir|last2=Hussain|first2=Aftab M.|last3=Torres Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Ghoneim|first4=Mohamed T.|last5=Rojas|first5=Jhonathan P.|last6=Aljedaani|first6=Abdulrahman B.|last7=Hussain|first7=Muhammad M.|title=Functional integrity of flexible n-channel metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors on a reversibly bistable platform|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=26 October 2015|volume=107|issue=17|pages=174101|doi=10.1063/1.4934355|url=http://repository.kaust.edu.sa/kaust/bitstream/10754/582486/1/1.4934355.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Zidan|first2=Mohammed A.|last3=Salama|first3=Khaled N.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Towards neuromorphic electronics: Memristors on foldable silicon fabric|journal=Microelectronics Journal|date=November 2014|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1392–1395|doi=10.1016/j.mejo.2014.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rojas|first1=Jhonathan Prieto|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed Tarek|last3=Young|first3=Chadwin D.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad Mustafa|title=Flexible High-&lt;formula formulatype="inline"&gt;&lt;tex Notation="TeX"&gt;$\kappa$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;/Metal Gate Metal/Insulator/Metal Capacitors on Silicon (100) Fabric|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=October 2013|volume=60|issue=10|pages=3305–3309|doi=10.1109/TED.2013.2278186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutbee|first1=Arwa T.|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed T.|last3=Ahmad|first3=Sally M.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Free-Form Flexible Lithium-Ion Microbattery|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology|date=May 2016|volume=15|issue=3|pages=402–408|doi=10.1109/TNANO.2016.2537338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed|last2=Hussain|first2=Muhammad|title=Review on Physically Flexible Nonvolatile Memory for Internet of Everything Electronics|journal=Electronics|date=23 July 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=424–479|doi=10.3390/electronics4030424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=M.

==Manufacturing==
Flexible printed circuits (FPC) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or [[flexible flat cable]]s (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07&amp;nbsp;mm) copper strips in between two layers of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]. These PET layers, typically 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm thick, are coated with an adhesive which is [[thermoset]]ting, and will be activated during the lamination process. FPCs and FFCs have several advantages in many applications:
* Tightly assembled electronic packages, where electrical connections are required in 3 axes, such as [[cameras]] (static application).
* Electrical connections where the assembly is required to flex during its normal use, such as folding [[cell phones]] (dynamic application).
* Electrical connections between sub-assemblies to replace wire harnesses, which are heavier and bulkier, such as in cars, [[rocket]]s and [[satellites]].
* Electrical connections where board thickness or space constraints are driving factors.

===Advantage of FPCs===
* Potential to replace multiple rigid boards or connectors
* Single-sided circuits are ideal for dynamic or high-flex applications
* Stacked FPCs in various configurations

===Disadvantages of FPCs===
* Cost increase over rigid PCBs
* Increased risk of damage during handling or use
* More difficult assembly process
* Repair and rework is difficult or impossible
* Generally worse panel utilization resulting in increased cost

==Applications==
Flex circuits are often used as connectors in various applications where flexibility, space savings, or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring. A common application of flex circuits is in computer keyboards; most keyboards use flex circuits for the [[Keyboard technology#Keyboard switch matrix|switch matrix]].

In [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] fabrication, glass is used as a substrate.  If thin flexible plastic or metal foil is used as the substrate instead, the entire system can be flexible, as the film deposited on top of the substrate is usually very thin, on the order of a few micrometres.

[[Organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs) are normally used instead of a back-light for flexible displays, making a [[flexible organic light-emitting diode]] display.

Most flexible circuits are passive wiring structures that are used to interconnect electronic components such as integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors and the like, however some are used only for making interconnections between other electronic assemblies either directly or by means of connectors.

In the automotive field, flexible circuits are used in instrument panels, under-hood controls, circuits to be concealed within the headliner of the cabin, and in ABS systems. In computer peripherals flexible circuits are used on the moving print head of printers, and to connect signals to the moving arm carrying the read/write heads of disk drives. Consumer electronics devices make use of flexible circuits in cameras, personal entertainment devices, calculators, or exercise monitors.

Flexible circuits are found in industrial and medical devices where many interconnections are required in a compact package. Cellular telephones are another widespread example of flexible circuits.

Flexible [[solar cell]]s have been developed for powering [[satellite]]s.  These cells are lightweight, can be rolled up for launch, and are easily deployable, making them a good match for the application.  They can also be sewn into backpacks or outerwear.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [[Scottevest]] solar jacket and the Voltaic [http://www.voltaicsystems.com/offgrid.shtml] and similar solar backpacks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Patent]]s issued at the turn of the 20th century show that early researchers were envisioning ways of making flat conductors sandwiched between layers of [[Insulator (electrical)|insulating material]] to layout [[electrical circuit]]s to serve in early [[telephony]] switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.et-trends.com/files/Circuits_100Years.pdf|title=et-trends.com - This website is for sale! - et-trends Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.et-trends.com |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] [[coated paper]]. [[Thomas Edison]]’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns [[cellulose gum]] applied to linen paper with [[graphite]] powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.

In the 1947 publication "Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger W. Curtis&lt;ref&gt;"Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger w. Curtis (National Bureau of Standards Circular 468 first issued 15 November 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; a brief discussion of creating circuits on what would have been flexible insulating materials (e.g. [[paper]]) indicated that the idea was in place and in the 1950s [[Sanders Associates]]' inventors ([[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua, NH]]) Victor Dahlgren and company founder Royden Sanders made significant strides developing and patenting processes for printing and etching flat conductors on flexible base materials to replace [[wire harness]]es. An advertisement from the 1950 placed by Photocircuits Corporation in New York demonstrated their active interest in flexible circuits also.

Today, flexible circuits which are also variously known around the world variously as ''flexible printed wiring, flex print, flexi circuits,'' are used many products. Large credit is due to the efforts of [[Japan]]ese [[electronics]] packaging engineers who have found countless new ways to employ flexible circuit technology. For the last decade, flexible circuits have remained one of the fastest growing of all interconnection product market segments.  A more recent variation on flexible circuit technology is one called "flexible electronics" which commonly involves the integration of both active and passive functions in the processing.

==Flexible circuit structures==
There are a few basic constructions of flexible circuits but there is significant variation between the different types in terms of their construction. Following is a review of the most common types of flexible circuit constructions

===Single-sided flex circuits===
Single-sided flexible circuits have a single conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible [[dielectric]] film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by [[soldering]]. Single sided flex circuits can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or cover coats, however the use of a [[protective coating]] over circuits is the most common practice. The development of [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted devices]] on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in [[Transparent LED embedded glass|LED Glass]] but also in flexible [[LED Headliner|automotive lighting composites]].

===Double access or back bared flex circuits===
Double access flex, also known as back bared flex, are flexible circuits having a single conductor layer but which is processed so as to allow access to selected features of the conductor pattern from both sides. While this type of circuit has certain benefits, the specialized processing requirements for accessing the features limits its use.

===Sculptured flex circuits===
Sculptured flex circuits are a novel subset of normal flexible circuit structures. The [[manufacturing]] process involves a special flex circuit multi-step etching method which yields a flexible circuit having finished [[copper]] conductors wherein the thickness of the conductor differs at various places along their length. (i.e., the conductors are thin in flexible areas and thick at interconnection points.).

===Double-sided flex circuits===
Double-sided flex circuits are flex circuits having two conductor layers. These flex circuits can be fabricated with or without plated [[Through-hole technology|through holes]], though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one side only, the circuit is defined as a "Type V (5)" according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the plated through hole, terminations for electronic components are provided for on both sides of the circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a [[mousepad]] to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.

===Multilayer flex circuits===
Flex circuits having three or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though this is not a requirement of the definition for it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers of the multilayer flex circuit may or may not be continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the obvious exception of the areas occupied by plated through-holes. The practice of discontinuous lamination is common in cases where maximum flexibility is required. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.

===Rigid-flex circuits===
Rigid-flex circuits are a hybrid construction flex circuit consisting of rigid and flexible substrates which are laminated together into a single structure. Rigid-flex circuits should not be confused with rigidized flex constructions, which are simply flex circuits to which a stiffener is attached to support the weight of the electronic components locally. A rigidized or stiffened flex circuit can have one or more conductor layers. Thus while the two terms may sound similar, they represent products that are quite different.

The layers of a rigid flex are also normally electrically interconnected by means of plated through holes. Over the years, rigid-flex circuits have enjoyed tremendous popularity among military product designer, however the technology has found increased use in commercial products. While often considered a specialty product for low volume applications because of the challenges, an impressive effort to use the technology was made by Compaq computer in the production of boards for a laptop computer in the 1990s. While the computer's main rigid-flex PCBA did not flex during use, subsequent designs by Compaq utilized rigid-flex circuits for the hinged display cable, passing 10s of 1000s of flexures during testing. By 2013, the use of rigid-flex circuits in consumer laptop computers is now common.

Rigid-flex boards are normally multilayer structures; however, two metal layer constructions are sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gcaflex.com/flexible-circuits/rigid-flex-circuits/|title=Rigid Flex Circuits, Flexible Circuits, Flex Circuit Boards, PCB Flex {{!}} GC Aero Flexible Circuitry, Inc.|website=gcaflex.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer thick film flex circuits===
Polymer thick film (PTF) flex circuits are true printed circuits in that the conductors are actually printed onto a polymer base film. They are typically single conductor layer structures, however two or more metal layers can be printed sequentially with insulating layers printed between printed conductor layers, or on both sides. While lower in conductor conductivity and thus not suitable for all applications, PTF circuits have successfully served in a wide range of low-power applications at slightly higher voltages. Keyboards are a common application, however, there are a wide range of potential applications for this cost-effective approach to flex circuit manufacture.

==Flexible circuit materials==
Each element of the flex circuit construction must be able to consistently meet the demands placed upon it for the life of the product. In addition, the material must work reliably in concert with the other elements of the flexible circuit construction to assure ease of manufacture and reliability. Following are brief descriptions of the basic elements of flex circuit construction and their functions.

===Base material===
The base material is the flexible polymer film which provides the foundation for the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit base material provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.
While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12&amp;nbsp;µm to 125&amp;nbsp;µm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.
There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.

===Bonding adhesive===
Adhesives are used as the bonding medium for creating a laminate. When it comes to temperature resistance, the adhesive is typically the performance limiting element of a laminate especially when polyimide is the base material. Because of the earlier difficulties associated with polyimide adhesives, many polyimide flex circuits presently employ adhesive systems of different polymer families. However some newer thermoplastic polyimide adhesives are making important in-roads.
As with the base films, adhesives come in different thickness. Thickness selection is typically a function of the application. For example, different adhesive thickness is commonly used in the creation of cover layers in order to meet the fill demands of different copper foil thickness which may be encountered.

===Metal foil===
A metal foil is most commonly used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available from which to choose and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, there are a number of different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.

In certain non standard cases, the circuit manufacturer may be called upon to create a specialty laminate by using a specified alternative metal foil, such as a special copper alloy or other metal foil in the construction. This is accomplished by laminating the foil to a base film with or without an adhesive depending on the nature and properties of the base film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Flexible circuit industry standards and specifications==
Specifications are developed to provide a common ground of understanding of what a product should look like and how it should perform. Standards are developed directly by manufacturer's associations such as the [[IPC (electronics)|Association Connecting Electronics Industries]] (IPC) and by users of flexible circuits.

The '''Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI)''' is an institution dedicated to research in [[Mathematics]] and [[Theoretical Physics]], located in [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name=hri-home&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/|title=Home|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1965, HRI offers a doctoral program in affiliation with the [[Homi Bhabha National Institute]].

HRI has a residential campus in [[Jhusi]] town near Allahabad on the banks of the River [[Ganges]]. The institute has over 30 faculty, 50 doctoral students and 25 post-doctoral visiting research fellows and scientists. HRI is funded by the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) of the [[Government of India]].

==History==
The institute was founded as the '''Mehta Research Institute''' of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics in 1965, with an endowment from the ''B.S. Mehta Trust'', [[Calcutta]]. The institute was initially managed by Prof. Badri Nath Prasad and following his death in January 1966 by Prof. S.R. Sinha, both from the [[Allahabad University]]. The first official Director of the Institute was Prof. [[Prabhu Lal Bhatnagar]] in 1975 when it became truly operational. He was followed by Prof. S.R. Sinha again.&lt;ref name=hri-history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/hri_history.html|title=History|publisher=Harish-Chandra Research Institute|accessdate=2012-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218024946/http://www.hri.res.in/hri_history.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  29 November 1975 [http://bdacharya.thescientificindian.com Dr. B. Devadas Acharya] joined the Mehta Research Institute (MRI) as its first Post-Doctoral Fellow and on 1 January 1980 was appointed as the first Assistant Professor of Mathematics at MRI.

Prof. [[Sharadchandra Shankar Shrikhande]] joined the Institute as its Director in January 1983. The institute was facing financial difficulties, and Prof Shrikhande sought DAE support for the institute. Following the recommendations of the DAE review committee, the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] committed to provide a campus for HRI, while the DAE committed to provide full funding for all operational expenses.&lt;ref name="hri-history" /&gt;

In January 1990, the Institute was granted about {{convert|66|acre|m2}} in [[Jhusi]] town of [[Allahabad district]] and Prof. H.S. Mani took over as Director. The institute moved to its present campus in 1996. Since then, the institute has grown in facilities, scope of research as well as number of faculty and students.

In October 2000, the institute was renamed in honor of renowned Indian mathematician, [[Harish-Chandra]].

Prof. [[Ravi S. Kulkarni]] succeeded Prof. Mani as the director in August 2001 and was followed by Prof. [[Amitava Raychaudhuri]] in July 2005. Prof. Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjee followed in May 2011.&lt;ref name=hri-ar2011/&gt;

A multidimensional signal is a function of M independent variables where &lt;math&gt; M \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Real world signals, which are generally continuous time signals, have to be discretized (sampled) in order to ensure that [[digital systems]] can be used to process the signals. It is during this process of discretization where [[sample (graphics)|sampling]] comes into picture. Although there are many ways of obtaining a discrete representation of a continuous time signal, periodic sampling is by far the simplest scheme. Theoretically, sampling can be performed with respect to any set of points. But practically, sampling is carried out with respect to a set of points that have a certain algebraic structure. Such structures are called [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s.&lt;ref name="mdsampling"&gt;Ton Kalker,"On Multidimensional Sampling", Philip Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Chapter 4, Section 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, the process of sampling an N-dimensional signal can be written as:-
:&lt;math&gt;w(\hat{t}) =  w(V.\hat{n})&lt;/math&gt;	
where &lt;math&gt; \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous domain M-dimensional vector (M-D) that is being sampled, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an M-dimensional integer vector corresponding to indices of a sample, and ''V'' is an N X N Sampling Matrix.

== Motivation ==
Multidimensional sampling provides the opportunity to look at digital methods to process signals. Some of the advantages of processing signals in the digital domain include flexibility via programmable [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] operations, signal storage without the loss of [[fidelity]],  opportunity for encryption in communication, lower sensitivity to hardware tolerances. Thus, digital methods are simultaneously both powerful and flexible. In many applications, they act as less expensive alternatives to their analog counterparts. Sometimes, the algorithms implemented using digital hardware are so complex that they have no analog counterparts. 
Multidimensional digital signal processing deals with processing signals represented as multidimensional arrays such as 2-D sequences or sampled images [http://www.dsp-book.narod.ru/DSPMW/04.PDF]. Processing these signals in the digital domain permits the use of digital hardware where in signal processing operations are specified by algorithms. As real world signals are continuous time signals, multidimensional sampling plays a crucial role in discretizing the real world signals. The discrete time signals are in turn processed using digital hardware to extract information from the signal.

== Preliminaries ==

=== Region of Support ===

The region outside of which the samples of the signal take zero values is known as the Region of support (ROS).  From the definition, it is clear that the region of support of a signal is not unique.

=== Fourier transform ===
The [[Fourier transform]] is a tool that allows us to simplify mathematical operations performed on the signal. The transform basically represents any signal as a weighted combination of [[sinusoids]]. The Fourier and the inverse Fourier transform of an M-dimensional signal can be defined as follows:-
:&lt;math&gt;X_a(\hat\Omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! x_a({\hat{t}})e^{-j\hat{\Omega}^{T}t}\hat{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_a(\hat{t})= \frac{1}{2\pi^M}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! X(\hat\Omega)e^{(j\hat{\Omega}^{T}t)} \, \mathrm{d}\hat{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; 
The cap symbol '''^''' indicates that the operation is performed on vectors. 
The Fourier transform of the sampled signal is observed to be a periodic extension of the continuous time Fourier transform of the signal. This is mathematically represented as:-
:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega)= \frac{1}{|det(V)|}\sum_k\! X_a(\hat\Omega-Uk )&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;\omega=\tilde V\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U=2\pi \tilde V&lt;/math&gt; is the periodicity matrix where '''~''' denotes matrix transposition.
Thus sampling in the spatial domain results in [[periodic function|periodicity]] in the Fourier domain.

=== Aliasing ===
[[File:Aliasing example in Fourier domain.png|thumb|right|alt= Figure illustrating a rectangular raster.|   Aliasing of a bandlimited signal.]]
A [[band limited]] signal may be periodically replicated in many ways. If the replication results in an overlap between replicated regions, the signal suffers from [[aliasing]]. Under such conditions, a continuous time signal cannot be perfectly recovered from its samples. Thus in order to ensure perfect recovery of the continuous signal, there must be zero overlap [[Multidimensional sampling]] of the replicated regions in the transformed domain. As in the case of 1-dimensional signals, [[aliasing]] can be prevented if the continuous time signal is sampled at an adequate sufficiently high rate.

=== Sampling density ===
It is a measure of the number of samples per unit area. It is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; S.D = \frac{1}{|det(V)|}=\frac{|det(U)|}{4\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
The minimum number of samples per unit area required to completely recover the continuous time signal is termed as optimal sampling density. In applications where memory or processing time are limited, emphasis must be given to minimizing the number of samples required to represent the signal completely.

== Existing Approaches ==
For a bandlimited waveform, there are infinitely many ways the signal can be sampled without producing aliases in the Fourier domain. But only two strategies are commonly used: rectangular sampling and hexagonal sampling.

=== Rectangular and Hexagonal sampling ===

[[File:Rectangular sampling.png|thumb|right|alt= Figure illustrating a rectangular raster.| Fourier domain representation with a rectangular ROS.]]
In Rectangular sampling, a 2-dimensional signal, for example, is sampled according to the following V matrix:-
:&lt;math&gt; V_{rect}=\begin{bmatrix} T1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; T2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where ''T1'' and ''T2'' are the sampling periods along the horizontal and vertical direction respectively.&lt;ref name="dudmers"&gt;Dan E. Dudgeon and Russell M. Mersereau, "Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing", Prentice Hall, 1984, Chapter 1, Pg 43-44,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sampling on a hexagonal grid.png|thumb|right|alt= Figure illustrating a hexagonal raster.|     Fourier domain representation with a hexagonal ROS.]]
In hexagonal sampling, the ''V'' matrix assumes the following general form:-
:&lt;math&gt; V_{hex}=\begin{bmatrix} T1 &amp; T1 \\ T2 &amp; -T2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in the efficiency of the two schemes is highlighted using a bandlimited signal with a circular region of support of radius R. The circle can be inscribed in a square of length 2R or a regular hexagon of length &lt;math&gt;\frac{2R}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; . Consequently, the region of support is now transformed into a square and a hexagon respectively.
If these regions are periodically replicated in the frequency domain such that there is zero overlap between any two regions, then by periodically replicating the square region of support, we effectively sample the continuous signal on a rectangular lattice. Similarly periodic replication of the hexagonal region of support maps to sampling the continuous signal on a hexagonal lattice.

From U, the periodicity matrix, we can calculate the optimal sampling density for both the rectangular and hexagonal schemes. It is found that in order to completely recover the circularly band-limited signal, the hexagonal sampling scheme requires 13.4% fewer samples than the rectangular sampling scheme. The reduction may appear to be of little significance for a 2-dimensional signal. But as the dimensionality of the signal increases, the efficiency of the hexagonal sampling scheme will become far more evident. For instance, the reduction achieved for an 8-dimensional signal is 93.8%. 
To highlight the importance of the obtained result [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/318221.html], try and visualize an image as a collection of infinite number of samples. The primary entity responsible for vision, i.e. the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] (rods and cones) are present on the [[retina]] of all mammals.&lt;ref&gt;D.Phil Jonathan, T. Erichsen and J. Margaret Woodhouse,"Human and Animal Vision", Cardiff School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are not arranged in rows and columns. By adapting a hexagonal sampling scheme, our eyes are able to process images much more efficiently. The importance of hexagonal sampling lies in the fact that the photoreceptors of the human vision system lie on a hexagonal sampling lattice and, thus, perform hexagonal sampling [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html]. In fact, it can be shown that the hexagonal sampling scheme is the optimal sampling scheme for a circularly band-limited signal.&lt;ref name="petmid62"&gt;D. P. Petersen and D. Middleton, "Sampling and Reconstruction of Wave-Number-Limited Functions in N-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces", Information and Control, vol. 5, pp. 279–323, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Aliasing effects minimized by the use of optimal sampling grids ===

Recent advances in the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] technology has made hexagonal sampling feasible for real life applications. Historically, because of technology constraints, detector arrays were implemented only on 2-dimensional rectangular sampling lattices with rectangular shape detectors. But the super [CCD] detector introduced by '''Fuji''' has an octagonal shaped pixel in a hexagonal grid. Theoretically, the performance of the detector was greatly increased by introducing an octagonal pixel. The number of pixels required to represent the sample was reduced and there was significant improvement in the [[Signal to Noise Ratio]] (SNR) when compared with that of a rectangular pixel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = R. Vitulli | first1 = R. | last2 = Del Bello | first2 = U. | last3 = Armbruster | first3 = P. | last4 = Baronti | first4 = S. | last5 = Santurti | first5 = L. | chapter = Aliasing effects mitigation by optimised sampling grids and impact on image acquisition chains | doi = 10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1025749 | title = IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium | volume = 2 | pages = 979 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7803-7536-X | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the drawback of using hexagonal pixels is that the associated [[Microlens|fill factor]] will be less than 82%.
An alternative method would be to interpolate hexagonal pixels in such a manner that we ultimately end up with a rectangular grid. The [[SPOT (satellite)|Spot]]5 [[satellite]] incorporates a similar technique where two identical linear CCD’s transmit two [[quasi]]-identical images that are shifted by half a pixel. On interpolating the two images and processing them, the functioning of a detector with a hexagonal pixel is mimicked.

=== Hexagonal structure for Intelligent vision ===

One of the major challenges encountered in the field of computer graphics is to represent the real world continuous signal as a discrete set of points on the physical screen. It has been long known that hexagonal sampling grids have several benefits compared to rectangular grids. '''Peterson and Middleton''' investigated sampling and reconstruction of wave number limited M dimensional functions and came to the conclusion that the optimal sampling lattice, in general, is not hexagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Xiangjian He | last2 = Wenjing Jia | chapter = Hexagonal Structure for Intelligent Vision | doi = 10.1109/ICICT.2005.1598543 | title = 2005 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies | pages = 52 | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7803-9421-6 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''' Russell M. Mersereau''' developed hexagonal discrete Fourier transform ([[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]]) and hexagonal finite extent impulse response filters. He was able to show that for circularly bandlimited signals, hexagonal sampling is more efficient than rectangular sampling. '''Cramblitt''' and '''Allebach''' developed methods for designing optimal hexagonal time-sequential sampling patterns and discussed their merits relative to those designed for a rectangular sampling grid. &lt;ref&gt;R. M. Cramblitt and J. P. Allebach, “Analysis of time-sequential sampling with a spatially hexagonal lattice,” J. Opt. Soc. Am., vol. 73, p. 1510, June, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hexagonal sampling grid.png|thumb|right|alt= Figure illustrating a rectangular raster.|     Distance between successive samples.]]
One of the unique features of a hexagonal sampling grid is that its Fourier transform is still hexagonal. There is also an inverse relationship between the distance between successive rows and columns (assuming the samples are located at the centre of the hexagon). This inverse relationship plays a huge role in minimizing aliasing and maximizing the minimum sampling density.
[[Quantization error]] is bound to be present when discretizing continuous real world signals. Experiments have been performed to determine which detector configuration will yield the least [[quantization error]]. Hexagonal spatial sampling was found to yield the least quantization error for a given [[Sensor resolution|resolution]] of the [[sensor]].

'''Consistent connectivity of hexagonal grids''': In a hexagonal grid, we can define only a background of 6 neighborhood samples. However, in a square grid, we can define a background of 4 or 8 neighborhood samples [http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~torsten/Teaching/Cmpt888/Literature/petersen62.pdf] (if diagonal connectivity is permitted). Because of the absence of such a choice in Hexagonal grids, efficient algorithms can be designed. Consistent connectivity is also responsible for better [[angular resolution]]. This is why hexagonal lattice is much better at representing curved objects than the rectangular lattice.
Despite of these several advantages, hexagonal grids have not been used practically in computer vision to its maximum potential because of the lack of hardware to process, capture and display hexagonal based images. As highlighted earlier with the [[SPOT (satellite)|Spot]] 5 [[satellite]], one of the methods being looked at to overcome this hardware difficulty is to mimic hexagonal pixels using square pixels.

Methods of '''hydrogen storage''' for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that reversibly release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon heating. [[Underground hydrogen storage]] is useful to provide [[grid energy storage]] for [[intermittent energy source]]s, like [[wind power]], as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Most research into hydrogen storage is focused on storing hydrogen as a lightweight, compact [[energy carrier]] for [[Hydrogen vehicle|mobile applications]].

[[Liquid hydrogen]] or [[slush hydrogen]] may be used, as in the [[Space Shuttle]]. However liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage and boils around 20.268 [[Kelvin|K]] (−252.882&amp;nbsp;°C or −423.188&amp;nbsp;°F). Hence, its [[liquefaction]] imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent [[Boiling point|boil off]] but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less [[energy density]] ''by volume'' than [[hydrocarbon]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.

[[Compressed hydrogen]], by comparison, is stored quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good [[Energies per unit mass|energy density by weight]], but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it requires a larger tank to store. A large [[hydrogen tank]] will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store the same amount of energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see [[hydrogen tank]]). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf Energy technology analysis]. International Energy Agency (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; to power the compressor. Higher compression without [[energy recovery]] will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low [[permeation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |title=Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-23 |conference=II International Conference "Hydrogen Storage Technologies" Moscow, Russia, 28–29 October 2009 |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storage Density of Hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Net storage density of hydrogen]]

=== Compressed hydrogen ===

Compressed hydrogen is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures to increase the storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=8780 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484 |last1=Eberle |first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd |last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar |last3=von Helmolt |accessdate=2014-12-19 |doi=10.1039/C2EE22596D |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/FCXClarity/package/index.html |website=Honda Worldwide |title=FCX Clarity |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |title=X-TRAIL FCV '03 model |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917105718/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |website=Nissan-global.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid hydrogen ===

BMW has been working on [[liquid hydrogen]] tanks for cars, producing for example the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]]. Japan have liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage at a tanker port in Kobe, and are anticipated to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savvides|first1=Nick|title=Japan plans to use imported liquefied hydrogen to fuel Tokyo 2020 Olympics|url=https://fairplay.ihs.com/ship-construction/article/4280251/japan-plans-to-use-imported-liquefied-hydrogen-to-fuel-tokyo-2020-olympics |website=Fairplay|publisher=IHS Markit Maritime Portal|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162°C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadaghiani |first1=Mirhadi S. |title=Introducing and energy analysis of a novel cryogenic hydrogen liquefaction process configuration|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2 March 2017 |volume=42 |issue=9 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals and research==
Hydrogen storage technologies can be divided into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.

===Chemical storage===
Chemical storage could offer high storage performance due to the strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve [[hydrolysis]] reactions, [[hydrogenation]]/dehydrogenation reactions, [[ammonia borane]] and other [[boron hydride]]s, ammonia, and [[Aluminium hydride|alane]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The U.S. Department of Energy's National Hydrogen Storage Project: Progress towards meeting hydrogen-powered vehicle requirements|last = Sunita|first = Satyapal|date = 2007|journal = Catalysis Today|doi = 10.1016/j.cattod.2006.09.022|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|issue = 3–4|pages=246–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density.  For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0&amp;nbsp;mol/L while [[methanol]] has a density of 49.5&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L methanol and saturated [[dimethyl ether]] at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L dimethyl ether.  These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917333529|title = Electrochemical hydrogen storage: Opportunities for fuel storage, batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Baizeng| first2=Fang|date = 2017|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.103|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|issue = 40|pages=25143–25165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.

==== Metal hydrides ====
[[Image:Metal hydride hydrogen.storage.graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|Metal hydride hydrogen storage]]
[[Metal hydrides]], such as [[Magnesium hydride|MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium aluminium hydride|NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium hydride|LiH]], [[LaNi5H6|LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[TiFeH2|TiFeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[palladium hydride]], with varying degrees of efficiency, can be used as a storage medium for hydrogen, often reversibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/storage/metal_hydrides.html DOE Metal hydrides]. eere.energy.gov (2008-12-19). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good [[energy density]], although their [[specific energy]] is often worse than the leading [[hydrocarbon]] fuels.

Most metal hydrides bind with hydrogen very strongly. As a result, high temperatures around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (248&amp;nbsp;°F) – 200&amp;nbsp;°C (392&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to release their hydrogen content. This energy cost can be reduced by using alloys which consists of a strong hydride former and a weak one such as in [[Lithium amide|LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lithium borohydride|LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Christian|first1= Meganne|last2= Aguey-Zinsou|first2= Kondo François|year= 2012|title= Core–Shell Strategy Leading to High Reversible Hydrogen Storage Capacity for NaBH4|journal= [[ACS Nano]]|volume= 6|issue= 9|pages= 7739–7751|doi=10.1021/nn3030018 |pmid= 22873406}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are able to form weaker bonds, thereby requiring less input to release stored hydrogen. However, if the interaction is too weak, the pressure needed for rehydriding is high, thereby eliminating any energy savings. The target for onboard hydrogen fuel systems is roughly &lt;100&amp;nbsp;°C for release and &lt;700 bar for recharge (20–60 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf EU Hydrogen Storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method for reducing dissociation temperatures is doping with activators. This has been successfully used for [[aluminium hydride]] but its complex synthesis makes it undesirable for most applications as it is not easily recharged with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = J. | last3 = Sandrock | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = J. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = W.

Currently the only hydrides which are capable of achieving the 9 wt% gravimetric goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; at least one of the second-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.

Proposed hydrides for use in a hydrogen economy include simple hydrides of [[magnesium hydride|magnesium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]. Neel.cnrs.fr. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[transition metal]]s and [[complex metal hydride]]s, typically containing [[sodium]], [[lithium]], or [[calcium]] and [[aluminium]] or [[boron]]. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and [[ammonia borane]]. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.

''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that [[Arizona State University]] is investigating using a [[borohydride]] solution to store hydrogen, which is released when the solution flows over a catalyst made of ruthenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10066-new-type-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-powers-up.html | title=New type of hydrogen fuel cell powers up | publisher= newscientist | accessdate=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Georgia Tech]] performed extensive benchmarking simulations on mixtures of several light metal hydrides to predict possible reaction thermodynamics for hydrogen storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Examining the robustness of first-principles calculations for metal hydride reaction thermodynamics by detection of metastable reaction pathways|author1=Ki Chul Kim |author2=Anant D.

==== Non-metal hydrides ====
The Italian [[catalyst]] manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using [[Hydrazine#Fuel cells|hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank full of a double-bonded [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] [[carbonyl]], it reacts and forms a safe solid called [[hydrazone]]. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.&lt;ref name="The Engineer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/303939/Liquid+asset.htm |title=Liquid asset |work=The Engineer |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-09 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon hydrides and germanium hydrides are also candidates of hydrogen storage materials, as they can subject to energetically favored reaction to form covalently bonded dimers with loss of a hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Zong, J., J.

International Journal of Quantum Chemistry 117.21 (2017): e25432.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrates]] (polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a bioreformer mediated by the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.

In May 2007 biochemical engineers from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced a method of producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway|year=2007|editor1-last=Melis|editor1-first=Anastasios|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.-H.

==== Synthesized hydrocarbons ====
An alternative to hydrides is to use regular [[hydrocarbon]] fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small [[hydrogen reformer]] would extract the hydrogen as needed by the [[fuel cell]]. However, these reformers are slow to react to changes in demand and add a large incremental cost to the vehicle powertrain.

[[Direct methanol fuel cell]]s do not require a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] over hydrogen. [[Alcohol fuel]] is a [[renewable resource]].

[[Solid-oxide fuel cells]] can operate on light hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] and [[methane]] without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow startup time of these fuel cells are problematic for automotive applications.

===== Aluminum =====
{{Main|Aluminum}}

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an [[energy storage]] method by a number of researchers. [[hydrogen]] can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water.&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper"&gt;[http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf White Paper: A Novel Method For Grid Energy Storage Using Aluminum Fuel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531060548/http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf |date=2013-05-31 }}, Alchemy Research, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army discovery may offer new energy source {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3036 |website=www.arl.army.mil |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall"&gt;{{cite web |title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells |url=https://phys.org/news/2007-05-hydrogen-aluminum-alloy-fuel-cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.

==== Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) ====
[[File:Perhydro-N-Carbazol.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Reversible hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole]]
Unsaturated organic compounds can store huge amounts of hydrogen. These ''Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers'' (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-free hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Liquid organic hydrogen carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495615000546|journal = Journal of Energy Chemistry|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 587–594|volume = 24|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jechem.2015.08.007|first = Teng|last = He|first2 = Qijun|last2 = Pei|first3 = Ping|last3 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterocyclic compounds|Heterocyclic aromatic compounds]] (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task.

Using LOHCs relatively high gravimetric storage densities can be reached (about 6 wt-%) and the overall energy efficiency is higher than for other chemical storage options such as [[Hydrogen storage#Synthesized hydrocarbons|producing methane from the hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cite.201100113 | volume=83 | issue=11 | title=Energiespeicherung mittels Methan und energietragenden Stoffen - ein thermodynamischer Vergleich |trans-title=Energy Storage by CO2 [[Methane|Methanization]] and Energy Carrying Compounds: A Thermodynamic Comparison|language=de| year=2011 | journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages=2002–2013 | last1 = Müller | first1 = Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes reported as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which means this process requires high temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dehydrogenation of decalin is the most thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second because of the presence of the methyl group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kinetic modeling of pure hydrogen production from decalin|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951707004368|journal = Journal of Catalysis|date = 2008-01-25|pages = 229–238|volume = 253|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jcat.2007.11.012|first = Bo|last = Wang|first2 = D.

Both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of LOHCs requires catalysts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was demonstrated that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties.

* Formic acid
In 2006 researchers of EPFL, Switzerland, reported the use of [[formic acid]] as a hydrogen storage material.&lt;ref&gt;G. Laurenczy, C. Fellay, P. J.

==== Ammonia ====
{{Further|Ammonia production}}
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an appropriate catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia is the second most commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a "carbon neutral" option for the future. Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is the suitable alternative fuel because it has 18.6 MJ/kg energy density at NTP and carbon-free combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AVERY|first=W|date=1988|title=A role for ammonia in the hydrogen economy|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0360319988900377|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=13|issue=12|pages=761–773|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(88)90037-7|issn=0360-3199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html The ammonia economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030624/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html |date=2008-05-13 }}.

==== Amine borane complexes ====
{{Main article|Amine borane complex}}
Prior to 1980, several compounds were investigated for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both positive and negative ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially [[ammonia borane]]) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds for use in the HF/DF and HCl chemical [[laser]]s, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms [[boron nitride]] (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane
(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Imidazolium ionic liquids====
In 2007 [[Jairton Dupont|Dupont]] and others reported hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability and are not inflammable can add reversibly 6–12 hydrogen atoms in the presence of classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ef060481t|title=Hydrogen-Storage Materials Based on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids|year=2007|last1=Stracke|first1=Marcelo P.|last2=Ebeling|first2=Günter|last3=Cataluña|first3=Renato|last4=Dupont|first4=Jairton|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1695–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phosphino-borane on the left accepts one equivalent of hydrogen at one atmosphere and 25&amp;nbsp;°C and expels it again by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The storage capacity is 0.25 wt% still rather below the 6 to 9 wt% required for practical use.

==== Carbonite substances ====
Research has proven that [[graphene]] can store hydrogen efficiently. After taking up hydrogen, the substance becomes [[graphane]]. After tests, conducted by dr André Geim at the [[University of Manchester]], it was shown that not only can graphene store hydrogen easily, it can also release the hydrogen again, after heating to 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22689 Graphene as suitable hydrogen storage substance].

====Metal-organic frameworks====
[[Metal-organic framework]]s represent another class of synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy at the molecular level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface of the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.

In 2006, chemists at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Michigan]] have achieved hydrogen storage concentrations of up to 7.5 wt% in MOF-74 at a low temperature of 77 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_0401.htm#hydrogen MOF-74 – A Potential Hydrogen-Storage Compound].

Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers at [[University of Nottingham]] reached 10 wt% at 77 bar (1,117 psi) and 77 K with MOF NOTT-112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/new-mof-materia.html New MOF Material With hydrogen Uptake Of Up To 10 wt%]. 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most articles about hydrogen storage in MOFs report hydrogen uptake capacity at a temperature of 77K and a pressure of 1 bar because these conditions are commonly available and the binding energy between hydrogen and the MOF at this temperature is large compared to the thermal vibration energy. Varying several factors such as surface area, pore size, catenation, ligand structure, and sample purity can result in different amounts of hydrogen uptake in MOFs.

====Encapsulation====
[[Cella Energy]] technology is based around the encapsulation of hydrogen gas and nano-structuring of chemical hydrides in small plastic balls, at room temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellaenergy.com Cella Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical storage===

In this case hydrogen remains in physical forms, i.e., as gas, supercritical fluid, adsorbate, or molecular inclusions.

==== Activated carbons ====
Activated carbons are highly porous amorphous carbon materials with high apparent surface area.

====Cryo-compressed====

Cryo-compressed storage of hydrogen is the only technology that meets 2015 DOE targets for volumetric and gravimetric efficiency (see "CcH2" on slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"/&gt;).

Furthermore, another study has shown that cryo-compressed exhibits interesting cost advantages: ownership cost (price per mile) and storage system cost (price per vehicle) are actually the lowest when compared to any other technology (see third row in slide 13 of &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lasher [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st002_lasher_2010_o_web.pdf Analyses of Hydrogen Storage Materials and On-Board Systems]. DOE Annual Merit Review June 7–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a cryo-compressed hydrogen system would cost $0.12 per mile (including cost of fuel and every associated other cost), while conventional gasoline vehicles cost between $0.05 and $0.07 per mile.

Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold hydrogen (20.3 K and slightly above) in order to reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.

Consequently, it has been demonstrated that a high driving range could be achieved with a cryo-compressed tank : more than {{convert|650|mi|km}} were driven with a full tank mounted on an hydrogen-fueled engine of [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/June07/Aceves.html S&amp;TR | Setting a World Driving Record with Hydrogen].

====Carbon nanotubes====
[[Image:Carbon nanotubes.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbon nanotubes]]

Hydrogen carriers based on nanostructured carbon (such as carbon [[fullerene|buckyballs]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K which is far from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.

====Clathrate hydrates====
[[hydrogen clathrate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caged]] in a [[clathrate hydrate]] was first reported in 2002, but requires very high pressures to be stable. In 2004, researchers from [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Colorado School of Mines]] showed solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing hydrates could be formed at ambient temperature and 10s of [[Bar (unit)|bar]] by adding small amounts of promoting substances such as [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1102076|title=Stable Low-Pressure Hydrogen Clusters Stored in a Binary Clathrate Hydrate|year=2004|last1=Florusse|first1=L.

==Stationary hydrogen storage==
Unlike mobile applications, hydrogen density is not a huge problem for stationary applications. As for mobile applications, stationary applications can use established technology:
*[[Compressed hydrogen]] (CGH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a [[hydrogen tank]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/ihfpv_zheng2.pdf R&amp;D of large stationary hydrogen/CNG/HCNG storage vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Liquid hydrogen]] in a (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[cryogenic]] hydrogen tank

===Underground hydrogen storage===
[[File:Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|'Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.'&lt;ref name=CSTAFF /&gt;{{rp|12}}]]
[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground [[cave]]rns, [[salt dome]]s and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] for many years without any difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/Ecn-h2a.html 1994 – ECN abstract]. Hyweb.de. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The storage of large quantities of liquid hydrogen underground can function as [[grid energy storage]]. The round-trip efficiency is approximately 40% (vs. 75-80% for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-hydro (PHES)]]), and the cost is slightly higher than pumped hydro, if only a limited number of hours of storage is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf |title=European Renewable Energy Network Study |date=January 2012 |pages=86, 188 |publisher=European Union |location=Brussels }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study referenced by a European staff working paper found that for large scale storage, the cheapest option is hydrogen at €140/MWh for 2,000 hours of storage using an electrolyser, salt cavern storage and combined-cycle power plant.&lt;ref name=CSTAFF&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT: Energy storage – the role of electricity |url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/swd2017_61_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf |date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=European Commission |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The European project [[Hyunder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why storing large scale intermittent renewable energies with hydrogen? |url=http://www.hyunder.eu/ |website=Hyunder |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cannot be covered by PHES and [[CAES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunder.eu/images/Presentations%20EUSEW/2%20HyUnder%20EUSEW%20workshop%20Luis%20Correas.pdf Storing renewable energy: Is hydrogen a viable solution?]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A German case study on storage of hydrogen in salt caverns found that if the German power surplus (7% of total variable renewable generation by 2025 and 20% by 2050) would be converted to hydrogen and stored underground, these quantities would require some 15 caverns of 500,000 cubic metres each by 2025 and some 60 caverns by 2050 – corresponding to approximately one third of the number of underground gas caverns currently operated in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing North Sea Energy Ashore Efficiently |url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WEC-brochure_Online-offshore.pdf |publisher=World Energy Council Netherlands|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Sandia Labs are conducting research into the storage of hydrogen in depleted oil and gas fields, which could easily absorb large amounts of renewably produced hydrogen as there are some 2.7 million depleted wells in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Enlisting Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells as 'Electron Reserves' |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/enlisting-abandoned-oil-and-gas-wells-as-electron-reserves#gs.ByNEEjY|website=Greentech Media|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power to gas===
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are two methods: the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid; the second, less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. A third option is to combine the hydrogen via electrolysis with a source of carbon (either carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide from [[biogas]], from industrial processes or via [[Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_(DAC)|direct air-captured carbon dioxide]]) via [[biomethanation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rathi|first1=Akshat|title=Batteries can't solve the world's biggest energy-storage problem.

This process is highly efficient, as the archaea are self-replicating and only require low-grade (60°C) heat to perform the reaction.

Another process has also been achieved by [[SoCalGas]] to convert the carbon dioxide in raw biogas to methane in a single electrochemical step, representing a simpler method of converting excess renewable electricity into storable natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoCalGas and Opus 12 Successfully Demonstrate Technology That Simplifies Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Storable Renewable Energy|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/socalgas-and-opus-12-successfully-demonstrate-technology-that-simplifies-conversion-of-carbon-dioxide-into-storable-renewable-energy-300633313.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=prnewswire|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK has completed surveys and is preparing to start injecting hydrogen into the gas grid as the grid previously carried 'town gas' which is a 50% hydrogen-methane gas formed from coal. Auditors KPMG found that converting the UK to hydrogen gas could be £150bn to £200bn cheaper than rewiring British homes to use electric heating powered by lower-carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Energy networks prepare to blend hydrogen into the gas grid for the first time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/06/hydrogen/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2018 |date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays can then be used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen, Fuel cell maker [[Hydrogenics]] and natural gas distributor [[Enbridge]] have teamed up to develop such a [[power to gas]] system in Canada.&lt;ref name="anscombe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anscombe|first=Nadya|title=Energy storage: Could hydrogen be the answer?|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/energy-storage-could-hydrogen-be-the-answer_N5028.html|accessdate=3 November 2012|newspaper=Solar Novus Today|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to [[natural gas]], the German gas networks were operated using [[towngas]], which for the most part (60-65%) consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf Naturalhy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets were set by the [[FreedomCAR]] Partnership in January 2002 between the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. DOE]] (Targets assume a 5-kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system). The 2005 targets were not reached in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscar.org/commands/files_download.php?files_id=82 Hydrogen Storage Technologies Roadmap]. uscar.org. November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The targets were revised in 2009 to reflect new data on system efficiencies obtained from fleets of test cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jun|author2=Sudik, A |author3=Wolverton, C |author4= Siegel, DJ |title=High capacity hydrogen storage materials: attributes for automotive applications and techniques for materials discovery|journal=Chem.

Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy|access&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2017}}{{verification failed|date=November 2017}}

It is important to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the working material, thus while a material may store 6 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)#Mass percentage|wt%]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.

In 2010, only two storage technologies were identified as having the potential to meet DOE targets: MOF-177 exceeds 2010 target for volumetric capacity, while cryo-compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds more restrictive 2015 targets for both gravimetric and volumetric capacity (see slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"&gt;R.

'''''In silico'' medicine''' (also known as "'''computational medicine'''") is the application of ''[[in silico]]'' research to problems involving health and medicine.  It is the direct use of [[computer simulation]] in the [[medicine|diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a disease]]. More specifically, ''in silico'' medicine is characterized by [[Computer model|modeling]], [[simulation]], and visualization of biological and medical processes in computers with the goal of simulating real biological processes in a virtual environment.&lt;ref name="cordis_insilicomedicine"&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Success Stories - In silico medicine reaches the clinic | work = European Commission CORDIS | accessdate = 9 November 2017 | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/86061_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''in silico'' was first used in 1989 at a workshop "Cellular Automata: Theory and Applications" by a mathematician from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).&lt;ref name="orchestra-qsar.eu"&gt;http://www.orchestra-qsar.eu/about-in-silico-methods&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''in silico radiation oncology'', a precursor of generic ''in silico'' medicine was coined and first introduced by G. Stamatakos in Proceedings of the IEEE in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;G.Stamatakos, D.Dionysiou, E.Zacharaki, N.Mouravliansky, K.Nikita, N.Uzunoglu,"In silico radiation oncology: combining novel simulation algorithms with current visualization techniques," Proceedings of the IEEE, vol.90, issue 11, 2002, pp.1764-1777, DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2002.804685 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1046955&amp;abstractAccess=no&amp;userType=inst&lt;/ref&gt; The same researcher coined and introduced the more generic term ''in silico oncology''.&lt;ref&gt;Stamatakos, Georgios.; (2006) "Spotlight on Cancer Informatics" Cancer Informatics (2) pp.83-86 [https://doi.org/10.1177/117693510600200029 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/117693510600200029] OPEN ACCESS&lt;/ref&gt; ''In silico'' medicine is considered an extension of previous work using mathematical models of biological systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stamatakos|first=Georgios S.|date=2006|title=Spotlight on Cancer Informatics|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/117693510600200029|journal=Cancer Informatics|language=en|volume=2|pages=|doi=10.1177/117693510600200029|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It became apparent that the techniques used to model biological systems has utility to explain and predict dynamics in the medical field.  The first fields in medicine to use ''in silico'' modeling were genetics, physiology and biochemistry.  The field saw a dramatic influx of data when the human genome was sequenced in the 1980s and 1990s.  Concurrently the increase in available computational power allowed for modeling of complex systems that were previously impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Maria Victoria|title=In Silico Systems Biology|publisher=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-62703-449-4|pages=Chapter 1|url=http://www.springerprotocols.com/doiresolver?genre=book&amp;pid=10.1007/978-1-62703-450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
There are numerous reasons why ''in silico'' medicine is used.  For example, ''in silico'' medical modeling can allow for early prediction of success of a compound for a medicinal purpose and elucidate potential adverse effects early in the [[drug discovery]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet, Ahmet; Sean, Ekins; Sandhya, Kortagere. "Applications and Limitations of In Silico Models in Drug Discovery." Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery, 2012-01-08. V910, p87-124. http://www.springerprotocols.com/Abstract/doi/10.1007/978-1-61779-965-5_6&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In silico'' modeling can also provide a humane alternative to animal testing.&lt;ref name="orchestra-qsar.eu"/&gt;  It has been purported by a company in the field, that computer-aided models will make the use of testing on living organisms obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insilico-biotechnology.com/en/improving-the-welfare-of-animals-researchers-develop-computer-aided-models-to-replace-animal-testing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The term ''in silico'' medicine is exemplified in initiatives such as the [[Virtual Physiological Human]] by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref name="fp7_EC"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) | work = FP7 European Commission | accessdate = 10 May 2013 | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in institutes such as the VPH Institute and the INSIGNEO Institute at the University of Sheffield.

==Research==
As modeling of human, social, behavioral, and cultural (HSBC) characteristics of patient behavior becomes more sophisticated, there is speculation that virtual patients may replace patient actors in medical school curriculum.  Additionally, there are projects underway that utilize virtual cadavers, computer simulated models of human anatomy based on CT images of real people.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, John A., Banks, Catherine M.

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isodar''' is a theory of habitat selection in [[population biology]] proposed by [[Douglas W. Morris]]. The theory underscores the importance of the abundance and thus competition between the members of the same species in selecting habitats. The name "isodar" stems from "iso" in Latin meaning same and "dar" from Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Morris DW. Habitat-dependent estimates of competitive interaction. Oikos, 55, 111-120&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals displaying an [[ideal free distribution]] distribute themselves among patches (sources of a resource) in such a way that each individual get the same amount of the resource.  For example, if food is twice as abundant in habitat A compared to habitat B, the ideal free distribution-based model would predict that there will accordingly be twice as many animals competing for food in habitat A compared to habitat B.  If the total number of animals is considered to be variable, there are two ways this can be plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian graph.  One way is to plot two lines on a graph of fitness vs. density of individuals.  This graph can be used to predict the density of individuals at any given level of fitness.  The second is to plot the density of individuals in habitat A vs. the density of individuals in habitat B when the fitness of all individuals is equal.  The line in this second graph is an isodar line.

An isodar, or habitat isodar, is a theory in [[evolutionary ecology]] developed in the late 1980s by Douglas W. Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|title=Spatial scale and the cost of density-dependent habitat selection.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|year=1987|volume=1|pages=379–388|doi=10.1007/bf02071560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|title=Habitat-dependent population regulation and community structure.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|year=1988|volume=2|pages=253–269|doi=10.1007/bf02214286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isodars model density-dependent habitat selection for one or two species in two habitats according to the [[Ideal free distribution|ideal free]] and ideal despotic distributions.  Isodar is a two-part word: "iso" meaning equal in Latin; "dar" for Darwinian evolution, and is defined as ''all combinations of population densities in habitats A and B such that both habitats offer the same fitness reward.''

Ideal free isodars predict that a species density in habitat A will increase linearly with its density in habitat B so that each individual in the species has the same fitness.  If habitat A has higher quality resources than habitat B, then proportionately more individuals would be in habitat A then in habitat B.  This can be shown on either a Fitness-Density graph (Figure 1) or a graph of density in two habitats (Figure 2).

&lt;/center&gt;

Isodars can also be used to study density-dependent habitat selection between two species competing for two habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas |author2=D.L.

Isodars have also been used to show the effect of human habitat selection on biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|author2=S.R. Kingston|title=Predicting future threats to biodiversity from habitat selection by humans.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=2002|volume=4|pages=787–810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

== Western legal culture vs non-Western legal culture ==
[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L. Jeffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD6xVr1CizIC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;dq=Neoplatonism+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20prophorikos%20the%20uttered%20word%20and%20the%20logos%20endiathetos%20the%20word%20remaining%20within&amp;f=false |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1992|isbn=0-8028-3634-8|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early translators of the Greek [[New Testament]] such as [[Jerome]] (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word ''Logos'' as used to describe Jesus Christ in the [[Gospel of John]]. The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} p. 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N.

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jili&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research''' is a research institute of the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]].

==History==
The Institute was established in 1990 through a generous benefaction from the late Dr [[Daniel McLean McDonald]], a successful industrialist. Dr D. M. McDonald, (1905 &amp;ndash; 1991),  was founder and Chairman of the [[Birmingham Sound Reproducers|BSR Group]], manufacturers of record turntables and record changers. The benefaction enabled the University to construct purpose-built premises for the Institute which include research rooms and laboratories, together with storage space, a seminar room and a modest library.

==Mission and purpose==
The Institute provides support for Cambridge-based researchers in the various branches of [[archaeology]], with a particular interest in the archaeology of early [[human]] [[cognition]]. The Institute emphasises the value of archaeological science, and contains laboratories for [[geoarchaeology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[archaeobotany]], and artefact analysis. The extensive faunal remains collection of the Department of Archaeology is now based within the McDonald Institute and a corresponding reference collection of plant remains is being assembled. There are also research rooms for post-excavation work on major field projects.

The Institute is primarily a centre for post-doctoral research though it does provide facilities for a number of PhD students whose research fits within existing McDonald Institute themes.  In addition to providing space for projects and researchers, the McDonald Institute also has an annual programme of grants for Cambridge-based projects, and an active publications division which produces the McDonald Institute Monograph series and the twice-yearly ''[[Cambridge Archaeological Journal]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10947">{{about|the product development strategy|the pilot episode of [[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]|Minimum Viable Product}}

A '''minimum viable product''' ('''MVP''') is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future [[new product development|product development]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ries, Eric"&gt;{{cite web 
| url           = http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html 
| title         = Minimum Viable Product: a guide 
| author        = Ries, Eric 
| date          = August 3, 2009 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gathering insights from an MVP is often less expensive than developing a product with more features, which increases costs and risk if the product fails, for example, due to incorrect assumptions. The term was coined and defined by Frank Robinson about 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SyncDev methodology|url=http://www.syncdev.com/minimum-viable-product/|website=SyncDev|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Steve Blank]] and [[Eric Ries]].&lt;ref name="def"&gt;W. S. Junk, "[http://www.cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs121/supp/DynamicBalance.pdf The Dynamic Balance Between Cost, Schedule, Features, and Quality in Software Development Projects]", Computer Science Dept., University of Idaho, SEPM-001, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ries, March 23, 2009, [http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html Venture Hacks interview: "What is the minimum viable product?"], Lessons Learned&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://steveblank.com/2010/03/04/perfection-by-subtraction-the-minimum-feature-set/ Perfection By Subtraction – The Minimum Feature Set]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, Ryan [https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2015/04/01/the-single-worst-marketing-decision-you-can-make/ The single worst marketing decision you can make] ''The Next Web''. 1 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.

== Description ==
A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more. Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers—such as [[early adopter]]s thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seeks to maximize information about the customer per amount of money spent.

"The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort."&lt;ref name="Ries, Eric"/&gt; The definition's use of the words maximum and minimum means it is not formulaic. It requires judgement to figure out, for any given context, what MVP makes sense. Due to this vagueness, the term MVP is commonly used, either deliberately or unwittingly, to refer to a much broader notion ranging from a rather prototype-like product to a fully-fledged and marketable product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/defining-mvp/|title=Defining MVP, MMF, MMP, and MMR|last1=Ambler|first1=Scott|website=The Disciplined Agile (DA) Framework|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An MVP can be part of a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers.&lt;ref name="MVP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/04/minimum-viable-product-rant/|title=Minimum Viable Product rant|last1=Radoff|first1=Jon|date=May 4, 2010|website=Jon Radoff's Internet Wonderland|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323181121/http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/04/minimum-viable-product-rant/|archivedate=March 23, 2014|deadurl=unfit|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a core artifact in an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and learning. One seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration. The process is iterated until a desirable [[product/market fit]] is obtained, or until the product is deemed non-viable.

[[Steve Blank]] typically refers to minimum viable product as minimum feature set.&lt;ref name="Blank, Steve"&gt;{{cite web

===Purposes===
* Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
* Accelerate learning
* Reduce wasted engineering hours
* Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
* Base for other products
* To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
* Brand building very quickly

===Testing===
* Results from a minimum viable product test aim to indicate if the product should be built to begin with. Testing evaluates if the initial problem or goal is solved in a manner that makes it reasonable to move forward.

===Notable quotes===
* Steve Blank: "You’re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone."&lt;ref name="Blank, Steve"/&gt;

=== Marketing ===
Releasing and assessing the impact of a minimum viable product is a market testing strategy that is used to screen product ideas soon after their generation. In software development, the release is facilitated by [[rapid application development]] tools and languages common to [[web application]] development.

The MVP differs from the conventional market testing strategy of investing time and money early to implement a product before testing it in the market. The MVP is intended to ensure that the market ''wants the product'' before large time and monetary investments are made. The MVP differs from the open source software methodology of ''[[release early, release often]]'' that listens to users, letting them define the features and future of the product. The MVP starts with a product vision, which is maintained throughout the product life cycle, although it is adapted based on the explicit and implicit (indirect measures) feedback from potential future customers of the product.&lt;ref name="Ries, Eric" /&gt;

The MVP is a strategy that may be used as a part of Blank's [[Steven Gary Blank#Customer Development|customer development]] methodology that focuses on continual product iteration and refinement based on customer feedback. Additionally, the presentation of non-existing products and features may be refined using web-based [[statistical hypothesis testing]], such as [[A/B testing]].

In software development, the general method of ''deploy first, code later'' is akin to the [[Agile software development|agile]] program code testing methodology called [[test-driven development]] where [[Unit testing|unit tests]] are written first and fail until the code is written.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Business Model Canvas===
The [[Business Model Canvas]] is used to map in the major components and activities for a company starting out. The minimum viable product can be designed by using selected components of the Business Model Canvas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://grasshopperherder.com/the-four-parts-of-a-minimal-viable-product/ | title = The Four Parts of a Minimal Viable Product | author = Kromer, Tristan | date = April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Customers
* Value proposition
* Channels
* Relationship

==Contraindications==
Andrea Contigiani said that his PhD research showed that early release of an MVP may hurt a company more than help when companies risk imitation by a competitor and have not established other barriers to imitation.&lt;ref name="Contigiani"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Limitations of Lean Startup Principles |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-limitations-of-lean-startup-principles/ |website=knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |publisher=Kowledge@Wharton, [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] |date=28 September 2018 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that negative feedback on a MVP can negatively affect a company's reputation.&lt;ref name="Contigiani"/&gt;

==Emerging applications==
Concepts from minimum viable product are applied in other aspects of startups and organizations.

=== Minimum viable brand (MVB) ===
Using a minimum viable brand (MVB) concept can ensure brand hypotheses are grounded in strategic intent and market insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2014/06/start-ups-need-a-minimum-viable-brand|title=Start-Ups Need a Minimum Viable Brand|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum viable co-founder===
Finding other people to create a minimum viable product is a common challenge for new companies and startups.  The concept of minimum viable co-founder is based on looking for a co-founder with the following attributes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/68846/Choosing-A-Minimally-Viable-Co-Founder.aspx | title = Choosing A Minimally Viable Co-Founder | author = Shah, Darmesh | date = October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trust
* Exceptional at building or selling
* Company commitment
* Personally likeable
* Productivity
* Reasonable
* Rational
* Realistic

===Minimum viable team===
Founders with an early-stage company are faced with the challenge of building a team with minimal people and cost. The process starts by listing out basic functions of a particular company (e.g., engineer, operations, finance) and then stripping down to the abstract job activities and skills that the company must have to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">[[File:KCL.png|framed|Kirchhoff's current law is the basis of nodal analysis.]]
In electric circuits analysis, '''nodal analysis''', '''node-voltage analysis''', or the '''branch current method''' is a method of determining the voltage ([[potential difference]]) between "[[Node (circuits)|nodes]]" (points where elements or branches connect) in an [[electrical circuit]] in terms of the branch currents.

In analyzing a circuit using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]], one can either do nodal analysis using Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) or [[mesh analysis]] using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Nodal analysis writes an equation at each [[Node (circuits)|electrical node]], requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation must give current as a function of voltage; an [[admittance]] representation. For instance, for a resistor, I&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of the resistor.

Nodal analysis is possible when all the circuit elements' branch constitutive relations have an admittance representation. Nodal analysis produces a compact set of equations for the network, which can be solved by hand if small, or can be quickly solved using linear algebra by computer. Because of the compact system of equations, many [[circuit simulation]] programs (e.g. [[SPICE]]) use nodal analysis as a basis. When elements do not have admittance representations, a more general extension of nodal analysis, [[modified nodal analysis]], can be used.

== Method ==
# Note all connected wire segments in the circuit. These are the ''nodes'' of nodal analysis.
# Select one node as the ground reference. The choice does not affect the result and is just a matter of convention. Choosing the node with the most connections can simplify the analysis. For a circuit of  ''N'' nodes the number of nodal equations is ''N''−1.
# Assign a variable for each node whose voltage is unknown. If the voltage is already known, it is not necessary to assign a variable.
# For each unknown voltage, form an equation based on Kirchhoff's current law. Basically, add together all currents leaving from the node and mark the sum equal to zero. Finding the current between two nodes is nothing more than "the node with the higher potential, minus the node with the lower potential, divided by the resistance between the two nodes."
# If there are voltage sources between two unknown voltages, join the two nodes as a [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]]. The currents of the two nodes are combined in a single equation, and a new equation for the voltages is formed.
# Solve the system of [[simultaneous equations]] for each unknown voltage.

== Examples ==
=== Basic case&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ===
[[Image:Nodal_analysis.svg|thumb|right|280px|Basic example circuit with one unknown voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

The only unknown voltage in this circuit is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. There are three connections to this node and consequently three currents to consider. The direction of the currents in calculations is chosen to be away from the node.
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) / R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through current source I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: -I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
With Kirchhoff's current law, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1 - V_S}{R_1} + \frac{V_1}{R_2} - I_S = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved with respect to V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{V_S}{R1} + I_S \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the unknown voltage can be solved by substituting numerical values for the symbols. Any unknown currents are easy to calculate after all the voltages in the circuit are known.

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{5\text{ V}}{100\,\Omega} + 20\text{ mA} \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{100\,\Omega} + \frac{1}{200\,\Omega} \right)} = \frac{14}{3}\text{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Supernodes ===
[[Image:Supernode_in_circuit_analysis.svg|thumb|right|182px|In this circuit, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is between two unknown voltages, and is therefore a supernode.]] In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is already known to be V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential.

The current going through voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we cannot write the current equations for either V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, we know that the same current leaving node V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must enter node V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Even though the nodes cannot be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining of the two nodes is called the [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]] technique, and it requires one additional equation: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

The complete set of equations for this circuit is:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{V_1 - V_\text{B}}{R_1} + \frac{V_2 - V_\text{B}}{R_2} + \frac{V_2}{R_3} = 0\\
V_1 = V_2 + V_\text{A}\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the first equation and solving in respect to V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we get:

&lt;math&gt;
V_2 = \frac{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 V_\text{B} - R_2 R_3 V_\text{A}}{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 + R_1 R_2}
&lt;/math&gt;


== Matrix form for the node-voltage equation ==

In general, for a circuit with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the node-voltage equations obtained by nodal analysis can be written in a matrix form as derived in the following.
For any node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, KCL states &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kj}=G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative of the sum of the conductances between nodes &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage of node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies &lt;math&gt;0=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of conductances connected to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. 
We note that the first term contributes linearly to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt;, while the second term contributes linearly to each node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; connected to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; with a minus sign.
If an independent current source/input &lt;math&gt;i_k&lt;/math&gt; is also attached to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression is generalized to &lt;math&gt;i_k=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt;.
It is readily to show that one can combine the above node-voltage equations for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and write them down in the following matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
G_{11} &amp;G_{12}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{1N} \\ 
G_{21} &amp;G_{22}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{2N} \\ 
\vdots &amp;\vdots  &amp;\ddots  &amp; \vdots\\ 
G_{N1} &amp;G_{N2}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{NN} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1\\ 
v_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
v_N
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
i_1\\ 
i_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
i_N
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {Gv} = \mathbf i&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf G&lt;/math&gt; on the left hand side of the equation is singular since it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {G 1}=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf 1&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;1\times N&lt;/math&gt; column matrix. This corresponds to the fact of current conservation, namely, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}i_k=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the freedom to choose a reference node (ground). In practice, the voltage is the reference node is taken to be 0. Consider it is the last node, &lt;math&gt;v_N=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it is straightforward to verify that the resulting equations for the other &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes remain the same, and therefore one can simply discard the last column as well as the last line of the matrix equation. This procedure results in a &lt;math&gt;(N-1)\times(N-1)&lt;/math&gt; dimensional non-singular matrix equation with the definitions of all the elements stay unchanged.

The '''numbered musical notation''' ({{zh|t=簡譜|s=简谱|p=jiǎnpǔ|l=simplified notation}}), is a [[musical notation]] system widely used in music publications in China (not to be confused with the [[musical notation#Integer notation|integer notation]]). It dates back to the system designed by [[Pierre Galin]], known as '''Galin-Paris-Chevé''' system. It is comparable to the [[Gongche notation]] from the Tang Dynasty.

It is also known as '''''Ziffersystem''''', meaning "number system" or "'''cipher system'''" in [[German language|German]]. It should be noticed that some other unrelated musical notation systems are also called [[musical notation#Cipher notation|cipher notations]].

The same system or very similar systems are used to some extent in some other countries such as Japan (with 7th being si), Indonesia, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and English-speaking Canada.

==Numbered notation described==

=== Musical notes ===

Numbers 1 to 7 represent the [[musical note]]s (more accurately the [[Degree (music)|scale degrees]]). They always correspond to the [[diatonic]] [[major scale]]. For example, in the [[key (music)|key]] of C, their relationship with the notes and the [[solfège]] is as follows:
:{|
| Note: || C || D || E || F || G || A || B
|-
| [[Solfège]]: || do || re || mi || fa || sol || la || si
|-
| Notation: || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
|}
In G:
:{|
| Note: || G || A || B || C || D || E || F{{music|sharp}}
|-
| [[Solfège]]: || do || re || mi || fa || sol || la || si
|-
| Notation: || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
|}
When the notes are read aloud or sung, they are called "do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si". ("Si" has been supplanted in English by "ti", for the sake of having a different beginning consonant for each degree.)

=== Octaves ===

Dots above or below a musical note raise or lower it to other [[octave]]s. The number of dots equals the number of octaves. For example, "{{underset|•|6}}" is an octave lower than "6". Musical scales can thus be written as follows:   
{|
|- style="vertical-align: bottom"
| Major scale: || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || {{overset|•|1}}
|- style="vertical-align: top"
| Natural minor scale: || {{underset|•|6}} || {{underset|•|7}} || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|}
Where there is more than one dot above or below the number, the dots are vertically stacked.

Where there are note length lines (see following section) underneath the numbers, any dots are placed below the lines. Thus the dots below numbers do not always vertically align with each other, since some of them may be moved slightly downward so as not to collide with the note length lines.

===Chords===
Chords can be transcribed by vertically stacking the notes, with the lowest note at the bottom as with Western notation. Each note has its own octave dots, but only the lowest note has the length lines (next section).

Arpeggiated chords are notated by writing the standard Western arpeggiation symbol to the left of the chord.

Chord symbols such as Cm may be used if the exact voicing is unimportant.

=== Note length ===

The plain number represents a [[quarter note]] (crotchet). Each underline halves the note length: One represents an [[eighth note]] (quaver), two represent a [[sixteenth note]] (semiquaver), and so on. Dashes after a note lengthen it, each dash by the length of a quarter note.

A [[dotted note|dot]] after the plain or underlined note works increases its length by half, and [[double-dotted note|two dots]] by three quarters.

The underline, along with its joining, are analogous to the number of flags and beaming in [[musical notation|standard notation]]. So are dotted notes. But the analogue stops at notes worth three quarter notes and beyond, where dashes are used instead.
{|
| Whole (semibreve): || 1 – – – || Dotted whole: || 1 – – – – – || Double dotted: || 1 – – – – – –
|-
| Half (minim): || 1 – || Dotted half: || 1 – – || Double dotted: || 1 – – •
|-
| Quarter (crotchet): || 1 || Dotted quarter: || 1• || Double dotted: || 1••
|- 
| Eighth (quaver): || &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt; || Dotted eighth: || &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;• || Double dotted: || &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;••
|- 
| 16th (semiquaver): || {{double underline|1}} || || ||
|}

===Musical rest===

The number "0" represents the [[rest (music)|musical rest]]. The rules for length is similar to that of the note, except that it is customary to repeat "0" instead of adding dashes for rests longer than a quarter rest. Unlike the [[musical notation|standard notation]], there is no single symbol for the bar rest. The bar rest of {{music|time|3|4}} time is &lt;code&gt;| 0 0 0 |&lt;/code&gt; and the bar rest of {{music|time|4|4}} time is &lt;code&gt;| 0 0 0 0 |&lt;/code&gt;. For brevity the multi-bar rest symbol used in standard notation may also be adopted.

===Undetermined pitch===

When notating rhythms without pitch, such as in many [[percussion instruments]], the symbol "X" or "x" replace numerals. For example, a common clap pattern used in [[cheerleading|cheers]] can be written like this:

       4/4
 Clap: | X  X  &lt;u&gt;X X&lt;/u&gt; X  | &lt;u&gt;X X X X&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;0 &lt;/u&gt;{{overset|&gt;|&lt;u&gt;X&lt;/u&gt;}} {{overset|&gt;|X}} ||

=== Bar lines ===

Bar lines, double bar lines, end bar lines, repeat signs, first- and second-endings look very similar to their counterparts in the standard notation. The ending numbers, though, are usually slightly less than half as big as the numerals representing notes.

When several lines of music are notated together to be sung or played in harmony, the bar lines usually extend through all the parts, except they do not cut across the lyrics if these are printed between the upper and lower parts.  However, when notating music for a two-handed instrument (such as the [[guzheng]]), it is common for the bar lines of each hand to be drawn separately, but a score bracket to be drawn on the left of the page to "bind" the two hands together. This bracket is not the same as the bracket used on a Western piano staff; it's more like the bracket used to bind an orchestral section together in Western music. Sometimes the final double barline, and any barlines marked with repeat signs, also pass through both hands, but this is not consistent even in the same publication (see for example Xinbian Guzheng Jiaocheng {{ISBN|7-5359-2188-4}} pages 108 and 138, where they do and do not pass through both hands respectively).

If a piece of music for a two-handed instrument has a passage where only one hand is notated, lines of numbered notation without score brackets at the left can be used for this passage.  Hence a piece of music may shift between two-handed (with bracket) and one-handed (without bracket) layouts during the course of the piece.

Cadenza-like passages can have dotted barlines, or barlines can be omitted altogether.

It is possible to print a small fermata above a bar line; this represents a brief pause between the measures either side of the barline, as in Western notation.

===Accidentals and key signature===

The notation uses a [[Solfège#Variations|movable Do (1)]] system. The [[key signature]] defines the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of "1". So &lt;code&gt;1=C&lt;/code&gt; means "C major". Minor keys are based on the [[natural minor]] or the [[Aeolian mode]], and the key signature defines the pitch of "6" of the minor key's [[relative major]]. So &lt;code&gt;6=A&lt;/code&gt; means "A minor", the tonic of which is written as 6. Naturally, the [[Dorian mode]] of D should be marked as &lt;code&gt;2=D&lt;/code&gt; and based on 2. Some people prefer to write "Key: C" or "Key: Cm" instead.

The same [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s in the [[musical notation|standard notation]] are used, and as in common practice, an accidental is placed before the notes "1 2 3 4 5 6 7" to raise or lower the pitch and placed after the note names "C D E F G A B", which are used for key signature and [[chord (music)|chord]] markings in the numbered system. But these accidentals are relative to the '''diatonic scale''' (1 2 3...) rather than the note names (C D E...). For example, even though the [[leading note]] for the harmonic C minor scale is "B natural", it is written as "{{music|sharp}}5".

Key signature changes are marked above the line of music. They may be accompanied by symbols that represent the note's degrees at previous and present key signatures.

===Time signature===

The [[time signature]] is written as a horizontal fraction: &lt;code&gt;2/4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;3/4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4/4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;6/8&lt;/code&gt;, etc. It is usually placed after the key signature. Change of time signature within the piece of music may be marked in-line or above the line of music. Some pieces that start with cadenza passages are not marked with time signatures until the end of that passage, even if the passage uses dotted barlines (in which case {{music|time|4|4}} time is usually implied).

Sometimes a piece is written with multiple time signatures simultaneously.  For example, it might specify &lt;code&gt;4/4 2/4 3/4 5/4&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that the length of measures is irregular and can be 4, 2, 3 or 5 quarter-notes.  The time signature of the first measure is always specified first, and the others are placed in increasing order of length.

Usually, the time signature is formatted as two numbers placed vertically on top of each other, with a horizontal line separating them.  This is slightly different from the formatting illustrated in the text above, due to technical restrictions.

A [[metronome]] mark may be placed immediately after the time signature if the time signature is part-way through the music, or below it if the time signature is at the beginning.  If present, this will be identical to the metronome marks used in Western music (this is the only place in numbered notation where Western symbols for note values such as quarter-notes and eighth-notes are used).

===Ties, slurs and tuplets===

Ties and slurs are curves resembling that in the standard notation, although they are always written above the music line in numbered notation.  Ties are much flatter than slurs; usually only the ends of a tie are curved, whereas slurs are curved throughout.  Chinese music books often draw ties and slurs with a single thin line, in contrast with the Western practice of making the line thicker in the middle.

In music for two hands, it is possible to write a slur that begins in one hand and ends in the other; this is usually done when the first hand has nothing more to play in that measure and hence there is room to draw the slur in the space which would normally have been used to draw further notes.  This is similar to some Western keyboard music where slurs between the staves are possible.

A slur with a small arrowhead on its right-hand end indicates a pitch bend between the notes under the slur, which is possible on some instruments.

Tuplets (such as triplets, quintuplets, etc.) are notated by writing a slur-like symbol over the notes and printing a small digit (3 or 5 or whatever is appropriate) in the center of this symbol, so that the line passes through the digit.

===Expression marks and dynamics===
Expression marks (including fermatas) are also written above the music line.  Special attention has to be paid on the [[staccato]] dot since it looks like the octave changer. It is either represented by a bolder dot further away from the music line or by the [[staccatissimo]] sign instead, which is an inverted triangle.

Dynamics ({{serif|'''''p'''''}}, {{serif|'''''f'''''}}, {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, etc.) and hairline crescendos and diminuendos are written below the line of music to which they apply, as in Western notation. The font of the dynamics is usually lighter than the font used in Western notation, so as not to be as heavy as the font for the numbers.

===Fingering and other instrument-specific marks===
Instrument-specific symbols can be written above notes. For example, in music for stringed instruments it is common to see wavy lines representing rolls. Fingering can be marked using four different kinds of finger symbol, respectively appearing like a lightning strike, the top half of a semicircle, a backslash, and the bottom left corner of a square.

Other instrument-specific symbols that are sometimes used include one resembling three slashes progressing diagonally downward, placed to the lower right of the numeral. This represents a tremolo. Another symbol is formed of a line proceeding from slightly to the right of the top right corner of the numeral and curving upwards, ending with the left half of an arrowhead.  This denotes a slide to a higher note (the exact pitch not always being specified), equivalent to [[portamento]] in Western music.

If there are slurs or ties and also fingering symbols, then the fingering symbols are written above the slurs or ties. Rolls (wavy lines) and tuplets are usually written below the slurs or ties. However, if a one-off chord results in many digits being stacked on top of each other and also has a roll symbol, it is possible to place that roll symbol above any slur or tie line to save space (to avoid moving the slur or tie any higher than the chord has already needed to move it).

===Glissandi===
Glissandi are represented by diagonal wavy lines with arrowheads at the end. The [[glissando]] symbol proceeds from bottom left to top right for an upward glissando, or from top left to bottom right for a downward glissando. It is used in place of a numeral. For stringed instruments, it usually indicates playing all the notes of the scale in rapid succession, i.e. for a downward glissando,

:{{overset|•|1}} 6 5 3 2 1

and for an upward glissando,

:1 2 3 5 6 {{overset|•|1}}

Note that a [[pentatonic]] scale is normally used in Traditional Chinese music, so "all the notes of the scale" in this case are 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.

Extended glissandi (over several octaves) are also possible, usually written with a longer diagonal wavy line that is nearly touching the numbers on either side of it.  In this case the numbers on either side determine the starting and ending pitches for the glissando.

===Grace notes===
Grace notes are notated like normal notes but are written in a small (about half-size) script on the line just above.  They are written with octave dots and note-length lines, and they are connected to the main note with a slur that proceeds vertically downward from the center of the note-length line of the grace notes and points toward the main note.  Grace notes may be placed either before or after the main note, indicating that they are to be played very rapidly either before the start of the main note or after the end.

==Variations of the numbered musical notation==

In some versions of the numbered musical notation, underlines indicating note length are written above the note instead.  Ties and slurs may be written below the music line.

In some versions, octave change is represented in a different way. Instead of dots above or below the numbers, a horizontal line is drawn and the number is written on, above, or below the line.

Another variation is to put octave bar "|" on the side of the number. An octave bar on the left is equivalent to a dot at the bottom. An octave bar on the right is equivalent to a dot on top. This is used in [http://musicmadeeasy.wikispaces.com/Digital+Common+Notation Digital Common Notation]. Digital Common Notation attempts to combine the benefits of the standard notation and numbered musical notation and is targeted for keyboard performing.

==Performing numbered music on keyboard==

It is possible to perform music in numbered musical notation in the traditional way. The player first locates the root note of the key on the keyboard and then mentally map the number to the keys on the keyboard. This should not be difficult for someone who can play the scales with traditional piano training.

A simple way is to transpose the root note to where the middle C is. The music can then be performed with the same fingering as in C Major. This approach actually reduces the 12 sets of fingering down to one. The method is described in [http://musicmadeeasy.wikispaces.com/Middle+Root+Note+Method MRN Method (Middle Root Note Method)].

==History and usage==

A similar invention was presented by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his work presented to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1742. Due to its straightforward correspondence to the standard notation, it is possible that many other claims of independent invention are also true. [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's]] credits [[Émile-Joseph-Maurice Chevé|Emile J.M. Chevé]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove Music Online (subscription required but many public libraries are subscribed; URLs vary).  China, §II: History and theory.  Alan R. Thrasher, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the system is used to some extent in [[Germany]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]], and more by the [[Mennonite]]s in [[Russia]], it has never become popular in the Western world. Number notation was used extensively in the 1920s and 30s by Columbia University, Teachers College music educator [[Satis N. Coleman|Satis Coleman]], who felt it "proved to be very effective for speed with adults, and also as a means simple enough for young children to use in writing and reading tunes which they sing, and which they play on simple instruments."&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Satis. 1939. Your Child's Music. New York: Van Rees Press:165-171&lt;/ref&gt; See the external links for more information.

The system is very popular among some [[Asia]]n people, making conventions to encode and decode music more accessible than in the West, as more [[China|Chinese]] can sight read ''jianpu'' than standard notation. Most Chinese traditional music scores and popular song books are published in ''jianpu'', and ''jianpu'' notation is often included in vocal music with staff notation.

Indexing with numbered notation makes it possible to search a piece of music by melody rather than by title. An actual example can be found in the [[Chinese New Hymnal]]. [[Parson's code]] on the other hand contains information on rise and fall in pitch only but precise pitches can be decoded from numbered notation. This way, a children's song book can be indexed like this:

:&lt;code&gt;|1·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;2&lt;/u&gt;3·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/code&gt; "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]"
:&lt;code&gt;|1 1 5 5 |6 6 5 – |&lt;/code&gt; "[[Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star]]"
:&lt;code&gt;|1 2 3 1 |1 2 3 1 |&lt;/code&gt; "[[Frère Jacques]]"

A reason for its popularity among Chinese is that ''jianpu'' fits in with the Chinese music tradition. It is a natural extension and unification of the [[gongche notation|''gongche'' notation]] widely used in ancient China for recording music. ''Gongche'' uses a number of characters to indicate the musical notes, and ''jianpu'' can be seen as using numbers to replace those characters. The [[monophony|monophonic]] nature of music in Chinese tradition also contributes to widespread use because so few elements are needed for monophonic music that music can be notated with little more than a [[typewriter]].

Compared with the standard notation, the numbered notation is very compact for just the [[melody]] line or monophonic parts. It is even possible to transcribe music in between the lines of text. Transcribing [[harmony]] can be done by vertically stacking the notes, but this advantage diminishes as the harmony becomes more complex (or [[polyphonic]]ity increases). The standard notation, with its graphical notation, is better in representing the duration and timing among multiple notes.

==Examples==

The two images below illustrate how the same piece of music is written using the standard notation and the numbered notation.

[[Image:AmazingGraceNumberedMusicalNotation.png|center|thumb|480 px|The hymn "Amazing Grace" written in numbered musical notation.]]

==Software for printing numbered notation scores==
A number of Chinese-language [[Microsoft Windows]] applications are available for the [[WYSIWYG]] editing of scores (optionally with lyrics) in numbered musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happyeo.com/intro_jpw.htm JP-Word &lt;span lang="zh"&gt;简谱编辑&lt;/span&gt;], commercial software with limited demo version&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medeli.com.cn/soft/gb/soft.asp MeiDeLi JianPu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuoqu.com/html/jpzy.htm 作曲大师简 (Music Master)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.13so.net/ QuickMake Jianpu software (QuickMake &lt;span lang="zh"&gt;简谱软件&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;简谱乐章&lt;/span&gt; (Jianpu Yuezhang), apparently no longer distributed by its author but a limited freeware version (&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;免费版&lt;/span&gt;) is available at various Chinese file-sharing sites&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TTComposer (&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;TT作曲家&lt;/span&gt;) published by &lt;span lang="zh"&gt;打本公司&lt;/span&gt; 1999–2001&lt;/ref&gt; Typically these support '''only''' the numbered notation, i.e. it is not possible to mix the numbered notation with a Western-style score in the same [[computer file|file]], but it is also possible to add numbered notation to [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] scores via a Chinese-language third-party plugin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slsgzs.com/jpcj.html]&lt;/ref&gt; English-language applications for working with numbered-notation scores are relatively rare, but there have been some developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1soft.com/smusic/index.htm S-Music] ([[free software]]; requires [[Microsoft Windows]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://simperhu.weebly.com/ SimpErhu], a freely-available [[TrueType]] font with a set of [[Microsoft Word]] macros for adding numbered notation to documents&lt;/ref&gt; There are technical methods of printing numbered notation (in various forms) with [[GNU LilyPond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.14/Documentation/notation/note-heads LilyPond documentation: Ez_numbers_engraver]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2012-11/msg00083.html lilypond-user discussion archives: jianpu-ly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-06/msg00167.html lilypond-user discussion archives: numbered notation using \markup and TeX]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
'''Nyctography''' is a form of [[substitution cipher]] writing created by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1891.

Nyctography is written with a nyctograph (also invented by Carroll) and uses a system of dots and strokes all based on a dot placed in the upper left corner. Using the Nyctograph, one could quickly jot down ideas or notes without the aid of light.

Carroll invented the Nyctograph and Nyctography because he was often awakened during the night with thoughts that needed to be written down immediately, and didn't want to go through the lengthy process of lighting a lamp just to have to extinguish it shortly thereafter.

==Nyctograph==
The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen square holes, each a quarter inch wide, and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Carroll's design, which could then be transcribed the following day. 

He first named it "typhlograph", but at the suggestion of one of his brother-students,{{clarify|reason=What does this term mean? Is this a fellow student? I'm not sure if Caroll was a student in 1891. Note: the wording is present in the original source as-is, so not an error.|date=November 2018}} this was subsequently changed into "Nyctograph".&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11483/11483-h/11483-h.htm “The Life And Letters Of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)” by  Stuart Dodgson Collingwood  B.A. Christ Church, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Carroll used an oblong of card with an oblong cut out of the centre to guide his writing in the dark.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; This did not appear to be satisfactory as the results were illegible. The new and final version of the nyctograph is recorded in his journal of September 24, 1891, and is the subject of a letter to ''The Lady'' magazine of October 29, 1891: 
{{quote|Any one who has tried, as I have often done, the process of getting out of bed at 2 a.m. in a winter night, lighting a candle, and recording some happy thought which would probably be otherwise forgotten, will agree with me it entails much discomfort. All I have now to do, if I wake and think of something I wish to record, is to draw from under the pillow a small memorandum book containing my Nyctograph, write a few lines, or even a few pages, without even putting the hands outside the bed-clothes, replace the book, and go to sleep again. … I tried rows of square holes, each to hold one letter (quarter of an inch square I found a very convenient size), and this proved a much better plan than the former; but the letters were still apt to be illegible. Then I said to myself ‘Why not invent a square alphabet, using only dots at the corners, and lines along the sides?’ I soon found that, to make the writing easy to read, it was necessary to know where each square began. This I secured by the rule that every square-letter should contain a large black dot in the N.W. corner. … [I] succeeded in getting 23 of [the square-letters] to have a distinct resemblance to the letters they were to represent. Think of the number of lonely hours a blind man often spends doing nothing, when he would gladly record his thoughts, and you will realise what a blessing you can confer on him by giving him a small ‘indelible’ memorandum-book, with a piece of paste-board containing rows of square holes, and teaching him the square-alphabet.}}

From the description it appears that Carroll’s nyctograph was a single row of 16 boxes cut from a piece of card. Carroll would enter one of his symbols in each box, then move the card down to the next line (which, in the darkness, probably, he would have to estimate) and then repeat the process.

==Nyctographic alphabet==
[[File:Nyctographic alphabet.png|thumb|Lewis Carroll's nyctographic alphabet]]
Each character had a large dot or circle in the upper-left corner. Beside the 26 letters of the alphabet, there were five additional characters for 'and', 'the', the corners of the letter 'f' to indicate that the following characters were digits ('figures'), the corners of the letter 'l' to indicate that they were letters, and the corners of the letter 'd' to indicate that the following six characters were a date in DDMMYY format. There was no capitalization, punctuation or digits ''per se'', though modern font designers have created them (e.g. capitals may be double-scored, punctuation marks may have the large dot at the bottom right corner, digits at the bottom left). 

==Numbers==
As in braille, letters were assigned to represent digits. The values were taken from his [[Memoria Technica]], which assigned two consonants to each digit, with vowels unassigned, so that any number could be read off as a word. For nyctography, one of the consonants was used for each digit. Most are the initials of the numerals, as follows. (In brackets are the other values of the Memoria Technica, which apart from leftover ''j'' for 3 have their own motivations.)

* 1 – b (first consonant) [also c]
* 2 – d (for ''duo'' and ''deux'') [also w of 'two']
* 3 – t (for 'three') [also j]
* 4 – f (for 'four') [also q of ''quatre'']
* 5 – l (roman numeral 50) [also v of 'five']
* 6 – s (for 'six') [also x of 'six']
* 7 – m (final of ''septem'') [also p of ''septem'']
* 8 – h (for ''huit'') [also k]
* 9 – n (for 'nine') [also g]
* 0 – z (for 'zero') [also r of 'zero']

[[File:Peloric Foxglove flowers.JPG|thumb|250px|A peloric Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) flower.]]
'''Pelorism''' is the term, said to be first used by [[Charles Darwin]], for the formation of 'peloric flowers'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionary|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pelorism|publisher=Oxford Living Dictionaries|access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which botanically is the abnormal production of [[actinomorphic]] flowers in a species that usually produces [[Zygomorphic|zygomorphic]] flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Pelorian|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelorian|publisher=The Free Dictionary||access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These flowers are spontaneous [[Floral symmetry|floral symmetry]] mutants. The term '''epanody''' is also applied to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Pelorian|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelorian|publisher=The Free Dictionary||access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) flowers are known to have evolved several times from radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) flowers, these changes being linked to increasing specialisation in pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cycloidea|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/tropical-diversity/evolutionary-development/cycloidea|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh|access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Peloric Streptocarpus flower.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A normal (left) and a peloric Streptocarpus showing the bilateral to radial symmetry alteration.]]
Pelorism has been of interest since a five-spurred variety of the common toad-flax (''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' L.) was first discovered in 1742 by a young [[Uppsala]] botanist on an island in the [[Stockholm]] archipelago and then in 1744 described by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. The mutant, spreading vegetatively, had five spurs rather than the usual one; however, the rest of the plant was normal. Linnaeus found that this variety was contrary to his concept that genera and species had universally arisen through an act of "''original creation and remained unchanged since then''". Linnaeus called this type of mutant a 'Peloria', the Greek for 'monster' or 'prodigy', because of the huge implications for the then current belief that species were immutable. He wrote that "''This is certainly no less remarkable than if a cow were to give birth to a calf with a wolf's head.''" The peloric plant fascinated Linnaeus to the extent that he grew it at his summer residence in [[Linnaeus' Hammarby|Hammarby]] and his explanation for it was that a toad-flax had been pollinated by another species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kader|first=Jean-Claude|year=2010|title=Advances in Botanical Research Volume 54|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123808707|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]], [[Charles Victor Naudin]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Hugo de Vries]] amongst others analysed and wrote about this significant mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustafsson|first=A|title=Linnaeus' Peloria: The history of a monster|journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics|year=1979|volume=54|issue=8|pages=241-248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and causation==
[[File:Peloric Foxglove - Barrmill.JPG|upright|left|thumb|A foxglove showing a peloric flower at the apex and more 'normal' flowers below.]]
[[File:DIGITALIS PURPUREA - ARTIGA LIN - IB-061 (Digital).JPG|upright|thumb|A normal foxglove plant.]]
It is notable in foxgloves that the terminal flower more frequently develops peloric features than lateral flowers and this has had been put down to terminal buds having a greater supply of sap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|year=1988|title=The Works of Charles Darwin, Volume 20: Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, Volume 20|publisher=New York University Press.|isbn=|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin took a particular interest in peloric flowers, growing and [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinating]] antirrhinums himself, as he saw the phenomenon as suggestive of a partial reversion to a past or ancestral type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|year=2001|title=The Correspondence of Charles Darwin, Volume 12:1864|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|isbn=0521590345|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peloric forms quite commonly appear as random mutations in several orchid species in nature and this is genetically controlled, although the expression can be influenced by both environmental changes and by stresses, additionally the occurrence is unstable and the same plant may exhibit normally on the next flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Challis|first=Alex|title=An abnormal Sobralia flower|journal=Irish Orchid Society|year=1979|volume=12|issue=1|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more highly evolved flowers such as orchids the details of pelorism may appear more complex with characteristics such as the two lateral petals replaced by two additional [[Labellum (botany)|labella]], the labellum replaced by an additional lateral petals in semipeloria or pseudopeloria where the modified labellum is less distinctively altered, however it is still distinguishable from the lateral petals and this confers a degree of [[Zygomorphic|zygomorphy]] upon the petal whorl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cronk|first=Quentin|year=1988|title=Developmental genetics and Plant Evolution|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=0-415-25790-5|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the production of peloric flowers has been shown to generally follow standard Mendelian inheritance, this is not fixed and had been linked to the inability of a plant to produce normal internodes, this failure resulting in the fusion of flower buds giving in [[Actinomorphic|actinomorphic]] flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=Ernest|title=Inheritance in the Foxglove, and the Result of Selective Breeding.|journal=Biometrika|year=1922|volume=14|issue=1/2|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxglove plants show the terminal peloric bud flowering first followed by the more normal buds flowering below, the reverse of the normal flowering pattern, the terminal flowers withering first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=M|title=Digitalis purpurea campanulata|journal=Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London|year=1942|volume=14|issue=1/2|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CYCLOIDEA (CYC) gene controls floral symmetry and peloric [[antirrhinum]]s have been artificially induced by this gene being knocking out.&lt;ref name=Bio8&gt;{{cite book |author1=Losos, J.B. |author2=Mason, K.A |author3=Singer, S.R. |title=Biology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Peloria derives from both new Latin and from the Greek word pelōros, meaning 'monstrous'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Pelorian|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelorian|publisher=The Free Dictionary||access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
It is found in several [[Orchidaceae|orchid]] species, such as ''[[Phalaenopsis]]'' it is demonstrated by flowers with abnormal numbers of petals or lips as a genetic trait, the expression of which is environmentally influenced and may appear random. It is widely noted in the mint family and species such as ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'', [[Sinningia speciosa|gloxinia]], ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''[[Pelargonium]]'', and [[Primula auricula|auricula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|year=1988|title=The Works of Charles Darwin, Volume 20: Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, Volume 20|publisher=New York University Press.|isbn=|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because peloric flowers are larger and arguably more attractive than normal flowers plants such as cultivars of the gloxinia (''Sinningia speciosa'') have been deliberately bred to have peloric flowers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">Broadly defined, '''positive neuroscience''' is the study of what the [[Human brain|brain]] does well.  Instead of studying [[mental illness]], positive neuroscientists focus on valued cognitive qualities that serve to enrich personal life and/or society.  Topics in positive neuroscience overlap heavily with those of [[Positive Psychology]], but use [[neuroimaging]] techniques to extend beyond the behavioral level and explain the [[neurobiology]] which underpins "positive" cognitive phenomena such as [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[optimism]], and healthy [[aging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveneuroscience.com/ positiveneuroscience]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Though '''positive neuroscience''' is only beginning to be recognized as an emerging field, empirical research of optimal or exceptional brain functioning has been conducted at least as far back as the 1970s.  Early work was confined to the use of lesion studies, and thus was only very case-specific.  Human [[Electroencephalography]], first practiced in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Swartz, B.E | year = 1998 | last2 = Goldensohn | month =   | first2 = ES| title = '''Timeline of the history of EEG and associated fields''' | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 106 | issue =  2| pages = 173–6 | doi=10.1016/S0013-4694(97)00121-1 | pmid=9741779}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a methodology for the study of creativity in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martindale C, Armstrong J |title=The relationship of creativity to cortical activation and its operant control |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=124 |issue=2d Half |pages=311–20 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4842281 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1974.10532293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in vivo brain imaging has become more sophisticated, investigations of positive neuroscience phenomena have incorporated functional imaging ([[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[Positron Emission Tomography]]) and structural imaging ([[Diffusion MRI]], [[voxel-based morphometry]], [[in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]).  Examples of research centers currently active in the field of '''positive neuroscience''' include [[Martin Seligman|Martin Seligman's]] lab at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Rex Jung's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725181422/http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; lab at [[The Mind Research Network]].

==The Templeton Foundation==
In 2009, the John Templeton Foundation and a committee of advisors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] put out a call for grant proposals aimed at investigators "conducting research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the ways in which the brain enables flourishing."  Qualifying projects had to "apply tools of neuroscience to positive psychological concepts", and focus on one of the following areas:

* [[Virtue]], strength, and positive [[emotion]]: What are the neural bases of the cognitive and affective capacities that enable virtues such as [[discipline]], persistence, [[honesty]], [[compassion]], [[love]], [[curiosity]], social and practical [[intelligence]], [[courage]], [[creativity]], and [[optimism]]?
* Exceptional abilities: What is special about the [[Human brain|brains]] of exceptional individuals and what can we learn from them?
* [[Meaning (existential)|Meaning]] and positive purpose: How does the brain enable individuals and groups to find meaning and achieve larger goals?
* Decisions, [[values]], and [[free will]]: How does the [[Human brain|brain]] enable decisions based on values and how can decision-making be improved? What can [[neuroscience]] reveal about the nature of human freedom?
* Religious [[belief]], [[prayer]], and [[meditation]]: How do religious and [[spirituality|spiritual]] practices affect neural function and behavior?

Fifteen research projects are now underway as part of the [http://www.posneuroscience.org/ Positive Neuroscience Project].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

'''SOLAS''' ({{lang-ga|An tSeirbhís Oideachais Leanúnaigh agus Scileanna|lit=Further Education and Skills Service}}) is a [[Public service bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state agency]] in Ireland. SOLAS was established on {{start date|2013|10|27}}. Its mandate is set out in the Further Education and Training Act 2013. Among other functions such as research, monitoring and co-ordinating of further education and training provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=A lot done in further education ... more to do|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/a-lot-done-in-further-education-more-to-do-1.1925529?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.irishtimes.com%252Fnews%252Feducation%252Fa-lot-done-in-further-education-more-to-do-1.1925529|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also advances moneys to education and training boards and other bodies engaged in the provision of further education and training programmes. 

The sixteen education and training boards (ETBs) were established on the dissolution of the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs).&lt;ref name="irishtimes-2013"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=If Solas is the new FÁS, can it make a difference?|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/if-solas-is-the-new-f%25C3%25A1s-can-it-make-a-difference-1.1253198|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time FAS, the national training and employment authority established in 1987, was also dissolved.&lt;ref name="irishtimes-2013"/&gt; The [[Department of Social Protection]] took over the responsibility from FÁS for Community Employment and Employment Services and over 800 former FAS staff. In 2014 the transfer of the former FAS training centre network, its 600+ staff and training facilities to the newly established education and training boards was successfully completed.

ETBs grant aided by SOLAS, offer around 270,000 places on 20,000+ further education and training courses in any one year. SOLAS also administers the Irish apprenticeship system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=Thousands opt for further education programmes, apprenticeships, traineeships|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/thousands-opt-for-further-education-programmes-apprenticeships-traineeships-1.3601982|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOLAS publishes an annual services plan setting out what further education and training courses will be provided in the sixteen ETBs in any one year and how much these courses will cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Setting is an important element in a narrative and in some works the setting becomes a character itself. The term setting is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[novelist]] [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pp.110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.

==Types==
Setting may take various forms:
* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]
* [[Dystopia]]
* [[Fantasy world]]
* [[Fictional city]]
* [[Fictional country]]
* [[Fictional crossover]]
* [[Fictional location]]
* [[Fictional universe]]
* [[Future history]]
* [[Imaginary world]]
* [[Mythical place]]

'''Sociography''' is writing on society, societal sub-divisions and societal patterns, done without first conducting the in-depth study typically required in the academic field of sociology. The term was coined by the Dutch sociologist [[Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz]] in 1913.

Sociography typically takes the form of loose commentary, although it may also be found as portions of novels that depict life in a given society. Much of the sociography currently in print focuses on society sub-groups, such as ethnic, neighborhood or occupational-geographic groupings.

==Conflict on scope of the field==
Some sociographers, such as Patrick Geddes, contend that sociography is more properly considered only as the limited combination of sociology and geography.&lt;ref&gt;John Clark, [http://library.nothingness.org/articles/anar/en/display_printable/303 "A Social Ecology"], (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this would also apply where the sub-society under study is not geographically limited.

==Recent history==
Sociography has taken on increasing importance in recent years, as many authors have begun to speak out on issues of race and culture. Although their writing is done without benefit of academic study, it is still considered a valid explication of a given cultural regime.

Within social science departments in many universities, sociography is now considered a meta-discipline, combining the study of literature, sociology, politics of culture, and economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''The Best in Heritage''' is an international, annual survey of award-winning [[museum]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] projects. The survey was launched in 2003 by the European Heritage Association from [[Zagreb]] under leadership from professor [[Tomislav S. Šola]]. The event is being held every year in the city of [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]] at the end of September. The aim of the conference is to give prize winning projects from the preceding year further professional and media attention. The event serves to identify and promote the best museum, heritage and conservation projects in the world. 

== The event ==
''The Best in Heritage'' is an annual presentation of awarded museum, heritage, and conservation projects. Over 40 hand-picked projects and institutions which have received national or international awards in the previous year are presented by their authors or institution directors, followed by discussions, exhibitions and receptions. Presenters explain why their achievements were proclaimed the best in the previous year and received an award. The aim is to present quality projects in anything concerning the care and communication of heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/international-conference-best-heritage-2018_en |title=The "Best in Heritage" |publisher=europa.eu |date=2018-03-15 |accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''IMAGINES'' ==
At the ''IMAGINES'' event New technologies and Multimedia projects are being presented in a one-day programme. 

== Patronage ==
The conference is organised in partnership with [[Europa Nostra]]. The main patron is the [[ICOM Fund]] of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.ne-mo.org/reading-corner/cultural-tourism.html|title=The Best in Heritage: Projects of Influence (14th Edition)|publisher=''Ne-Mo.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;, other patrons are: [[ICOMOS]], [[ICCROM]], [[International Federation of Library Associations]], the City of [[Dubrovnik]] and the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]]. The Museums of Dubrovnik are local partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebestinheritage.com/event/sponsors/ |title=Sponsors, Patrons, Supporters |publisher=The Best in Heritage |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects of Influence ==
From 2015 onward, the conference audience, together with moderators and last year's winners, votes for the "Project of influence" award for each of the two events, winners of which are announced at the closing ceremony.

This article attempts to place key plant innovations in a geological context.  It concerns itself only with novel adaptations and events that had a major ecological significance, not those that are of solely anthropological interest.  The timeline displays a graphical representation of the adaptations; the text attempts to explain the nature and robustness of the evidence.

{{Life timeline}}

'''Plant evolution''' is an aspect of the study of [[biological evolution]], predominantly involving evolution of plants suited to live on land, greening of various land masses by the filling of their [[Ecological niche|niches]] with land plants, and diversification of groups of land plants.

==Earliest plants==
In the strictest sense, the name ''plant'' refers to those land plants that form the [[clade]] [[Embryophyta]], comprising the bryophytes and vascular plants.  However, the clade [[Viridiplantae]] or green plants includes some other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including [[green algae]]. It is widely believed that land plants evolved from a group of [[charophyte]]s, most likely simple single-celled terrestrial algae similar to extant [[Klebsormidiophyceae]]&lt;ref name=delbem2018&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Del-Bem, Luiz-Eduardo |authorlink=

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chloroplasts]] in plants evolved from an [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiotic]] relationship between a [[cyanobacterium]], a photosynthesising [[prokaryote]] and a non-photosynthetic [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organism, producing a lineage of photosynthesizing eukaryotic organisms in marine and freshwater environments.  These earliest photosynthesizing single-celled autotrophs evolved into multicellular organisms such as the  [[Charophyta]], a group of freshwater green algae.

Fossil evidence of plants begins around 3000 Ma with indirect evidence of oxygen-producing photosynthesis in the geological record, in the form of chemical and isotopic signatures in rocks and fossil evidence of colonies of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing [[prokaryotic]] organisms.  Cyanobacteria use water as a [[reducing agent]], producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early [[Redox|reducing]] atmosphere of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved.  This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then [[oxidizing agent|oxidized]] dissolved [[iron]] in the oceans, the iron precipitated out of the sea water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called [[Banded Iron Formation]]s (BIFs).   These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated.  This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the [[Ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet]] blocking [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone layer.  The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] organisms, and resulting in a highly oxidizing atmosphere, and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.

Fossil evidence for cyanobacteria also comes from the presence of [[stromatolite]]s in the fossil record deep into the [[Precambrian]].  Stromatolites are layered structures formed by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial [[biofilm]]s, such as those produced by cyanobacteria.  The direct evidence for cyanobacteria is less certain than the evidence for their presence as primary producers of atmospheric oxygen.  Modern stromatolites containing cyanobacteria [[Stromatolite#Modern occurrence|can be found]] on the west coast of Australia and other areas in saline lagoons and in freshwater.

==Paleozoic flora==

===[[Cambrian]] flora===
Early plants were small, unicellular or filamentous, with simple branching.  The identification of plant fossils in Cambrian strata is an uncertain area in the evolutionary history of plants because of the small and soft-bodied nature of these plants.  It is also difficult in a fossil of this age to distinguish among various similar appearing groups with simple branching patterns, and not all of these groups are plants.  One exception to the uncertainty of fossils from this age is the group of calcareous green algae, [[Dasycladales]] found in the fossil record since the middle Cambrian.  These algae do not belong to the lineage that is ancestral to the land plants.  Other major groups of green algae had been established by this time, but there were no [[land plants]] with vascular tissues until the mid-[[Silurian]].

===[[Ordovician]] flora===
The evidence of plant evolution changes dramatically in the Ordovician with the first extensive appearance of spores in the fossil record (Cambrian spores have been found, also).  The first terrestrial [[plant]]s were probably in the form of tiny plants resembling [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s when, around the Middle Ordovician, evidence for the beginning of the terrestrialization of the land is found in the form of tetrads of spores with resistant polymers in their outer walls. These early plants did not have conducting tissues, severely limiting their size.  They were, in effect, tied to wet terrestrial environments by their inability to conduct water, like extant [[liverworts]], [[hornworts]], and [[mosses]], although they reproduced with [[spores]], important dispersal units that have hard protective outer coatings, allowing for their preservation in the fossil record, in addition to protecting the future offspring against the desiccating environment of life on land.  With spores, plants on land could have sent out large numbers of spores that could grow into an adult plant when sufficient environmental moisture was present.

===[[Silurian]] flora===
[[File:Cooksonia pertoni revised.png|thumb|right|Artist's impression of ''Cooksonia pertoni'']]
The first fossil records of [[vascular plant]]s, that is, land plants with [[vascular tissue]]s, appeared in the [[Silurian period]]. The earliest known representatives of this group (mostly from the northern hemisphere) are placed in the genus ''[[Cooksonia]]''. They had very simple branching patterns, with the branches terminated by flattened sporangia.  By the end of the Silurian much more complex vascular plants, the [[Zosterophyllopsida|zosterophylls]], had diversified&lt;ref name=Kotyketal2002&gt;{{Citation |last=Kotyk |first=M.E. |last2=Basinger |first2=J.F. |last3=Gensel |first3=P.G. |last4=de Freitas |first4=T.A. |year=2002 |title=Morphologically complex plant macrofossils from the Late Silurian of Arctic Canada |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=89 |pages=1004–1013 |doi=10.3732/ajb.89.6.1004 |lastauthoramp=yes |pmid=21665700}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primitive [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]]s, such as ''[[Baragwanathia]]'' (originally discovered in Silurian deposits in Victoria, Australia),&lt;ref name=Lang&amp;Cookson&gt;{{cite journal

===[[Devonian]] flora===
By the Devonian Period, the colonization of the land by plants was well underway. The [[bacterium|bacteria]]l and algal mats were joined early in the period by primitive [[plant]]s that created the first recognizable [[soil]]s and harbored some arthropods like [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[myriapod]]s. Early Devonian plants did not have roots or leaves like the plants most common today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They probably relied on [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l symbioses with fungi to provide them with water and mineral nutrients such as [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon, L. |author2=Bousquet, J. |author3=Levesque, C. |author4=Lalonde, M. |year=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=363 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1038/363067a0 |issue=6424 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S}}&lt;/ref&gt; They probably spread by a combination of [[vegetative reproduction]] forming clonal colonies, and sexual reproduction via spores and did not grow much more than a few centimeters tall.

By the Late Devonian, forests of large, primitive plants existed: [[lycophyte]]s, [[Equisetopsida|sphenophytes]], [[fern]]s, and [[progymnosperm]]s had [[Evolution|evolved]]. Most of these plants have true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The tree-like ''[[Archaeopteris]]'', ancestral to the gymnosperms, and the giant [[cladoxylopsid]] trees had true [[wood]]. These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. ''[[Prototaxites]]'' was the fruiting body of an enormous fungus that stood more than 8 meters tall. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the "Devonian Explosion". The primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterizes a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the late Devonian. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of [[erosion]] and sediment deposition.

The 'greening' of the continents acted as a [[carbon dioxide]] [[Carbon dioxide sink|sink]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of this [[greenhouse gas]] may have dropped.&lt;ref name=Beerling&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Beerling |authorlink = David Beerling|title=The Emerald Planet: How Plants Changed Earth's History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=9780199548149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive [[extinction event]]. see [[Late Devonian extinction]].

Also in the Devonian, both [[vertebrate]]s and arthropods were solidly established on the land.

===[[Carboniferous]] flora===
[[File:StigmariaOhioPennsylvanian.jpg|thumb|''Stigmaria'', a fossil tree root. Upper [[Carboniferous]] of northeastern [[Ohio]].]]
[[File:LepidodendronOhio.jpg|thumb|External mold of ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' from the [[Upper Carboniferous]] of [[Ohio]].]]
[[Mississippian age|Early Carboniferous]] land plants were very similar to those of the preceding Latest Devonian, but new groups also appeared at this time.

The main Early Carboniferous plants were the [[Equisetales]] (Horse-tails), [[Sphenophyllum|Sphenophyllales]] (scrambling plants), [[Lycopodiales]] (Club mosses), [[Lepidodendrales]] (arborescent clubmosses or scale trees), [[Filicales]] (Ferns), [[Medullosales]] (previously included in the "[[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]", an artificial assemblage of a  number of early [[gymnosperm]] groups) and the [[Cordaitales]]. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Carboniferous]], several other groups, [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), the [[Callistophytales]] (another group of "seed ferns"), and the [[Voltziales]] (related to and sometimes included under the [[conifers]]), appeared.

The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which were cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-mosses of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter.  These included ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' (with its fruit cone called ''[[Lepidostrobus]]''), ''[[Halonia]]'', ''[[Lepidophloios]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]''.   The roots of several of these forms are known as ''[[Stigmaria]]''.

The fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were epiphytic. Fossil ferns include ''[[Pecopteris]]'' and the tree ferns ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]''. Seed ferns or Pteridospermatophyta include ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''.

The Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm and a height of up to 20 meters. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the modern horsetails.

''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like inflorescence, which bore yew-like berries, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves.  True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.

===[[Permian]] flora===
The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian there was a major transition in vegetation. The swamp-loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were replaced by the more advanced conifers, which were better adapted to the changing climatic conditions. Lycopods and swamp forests still dominated the [[South China (continent)|South China]] continent because it was an isolated continent and it sat near or at the equator. The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. The [[ginkgo]]s and cycads also appeared during this period. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The [[gigantopterid]]s thrived during this time; some of these may have been part of the ancestral [[flowering plant]] lineage, though flowers evolved only considerably later.

==[[Mesozoic]] flora==

===[[Triassic]] flora===
On land, the holdover plants included the [[lycophyte]]s, the dominant [[cycad]]s, [[Ginkgophyta]] (represented in modern times by ''[[Ginkgo|Ginkgo biloba]]'') and [[Glossopteridales|glossopterid]]s. The [[spermatophyte]]s, or seed plants came to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere, [[conifer]]s flourished. ''[[Dicroidium]]'' (a [[seed fern]]) was the dominant southern hemisphere tree during the Early Triassic period.

===[[Jurassic]] flora===
The arid, continental conditions characteristic of the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Haines 2000"&gt;Haines, Tim. 2000. ''Walking with Dinosaurs:  A Natural History'', (New York:  Dorling Kindersley Publishing, Inc.) {{ISBN|0-563-38449-2}}. Page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conifers]] dominated the flora, as during the Triassic; they were the most diverse group and constituted the majority of large trees. Extant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the [[Araucariaceae]], [[Cephalotaxaceae]], [[Pinaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], [[Taxaceae]] and [[Taxodiaceae]].&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer 1992"&gt;Behrensmeyer, Anna K., Damuth, J.D., DiMichele, W.A., Potts, R., Sues, H.D. &amp; Wing, S.L. (eds.). 1992. ''Terrestrial Ecosystems through Time: the Evolutionary Paleoecology of Terrestrial Plants and Animals'', (Chicago &amp; London: [[University of Chicago Press]]), {{ISBN|0-226-04154-9}} (cloth), {{ISBN|0-226-04155-7}} (paper). Page 349.&lt;/ref&gt; The extinct Mesozoic conifer family [[Cheirolepidiaceae]] dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby [[Bennettitales]].&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 352"&gt;Behrensmeyer ''et al.'', 1992, 352&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycad]]s were also common, as were [[ginkgo]]s and [[tree ferns]] in the forest. Smaller [[fern]]s were probably the dominant undergrowth. [[Caytoniacea|Caytoniaceous seed ferns]] were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.&lt;ref&gt;Behrensmeyer ''et al.'', 1992, 353&lt;/ref&gt; Ginkgo-like plants were particularly common in the mid- to high northern latitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, [[podocarps]] were especially successful, while Ginkgos  and [[Czekanowskiales]] were rare.&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 352"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haines, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Cretaceous]] flora===
[[File:Archaeamphora longicervia.png|thumb|Artist's restoration of ''[[Archaeamphora longicervia]]'', the earliest known carnivorous plant]]
Flowering plants, also known as [[angiosperms]], spread during this period, although they did not become predominant until near the end of the period ([[Campanian|Campanian age]]). Their evolution was aided by the appearance of [[bee]]s; in fact angiosperms and insects are a good example of [[coevolution]]. The first representatives of many modern trees, including [[ficus|fig]]s, [[Platanus|planes]] and [[magnolia]]s, appeared in the Cretaceous. At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic [[gymnosperm]]s, like [[Conifer]]s continued to thrive, although other taxa like [[Bennettitales]] died out before the end of the period.

==Cenozoic flora==
The Cenozoic is just as much the age of savannas, or the age of co-dependent flowering plants and insects. At 35 Ma, [[grasses]] evolved from among the angiosperms.
About ten thousand years ago, humans in the [[Fertile Crescent]] of the Middle East develop agriculture. Plant domestication begins with cultivation of [[Neolithic]] founder crops. This process of food production, coupled later with the domestication of animals caused a massive increase in human population that has continued to the present. In Jericho (modern Israel), there is a settlement with about 19,000 people. At the same time, Sahara is green with rivers, lakes, cattle, crocodiles and monsoons.
At 8 ka, Common (Bread) wheat (''[[Triticum aestivum]]'') originates in southwest Asia due to hybridisation of emmer wheat with a goat-grass, ''[[Aegilops tauschii]]''.
At 6.5 ka, two rice species are domesticated: Asian rice, ''[[Oryza sativa]]'', and African rice ''[[Oryza glaberrima]]''.

'''Vaccinia virus''' ('''VACV''' or '''VV''') is a large, complex, [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] [[virus]] belonging to the [[poxvirus]] family.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a linear, double-stranded [[DNA]] [[genome]] approximately 190 [[base pair|kbp]] in length, and which encodes approximately 250 [[gene]]s. The dimensions of the [[virion]] are roughly 360 × 270 × 250&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], with a mass of approximately 5-10 fg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = L.| first2 = A.

[[Smallpox]] was the first disease to be widely prevented by vaccination due to pioneering work by the English physician and scientist [[Edward Jenner]], in the eighteenth century, using [[cowpox]] virus. Vaccinia virus is the active constituent of the [[smallpox vaccine|vaccine that eradicated smallpox]], making it the first human disease to be eradicated. This endeavour was carried out by the [[World Health Organization]] under the [[Smallpox vaccine#Eradication of smallpox|Smallpox Eradication Program]]. Post eradication of smallpox, scientists study vaccinia virus to use as a tool for delivering genes into biological tissues ([[gene therapy]] and [[genetic engineering]]) and because of concerns about smallpox being used as an agent for [[bioterrorism]].

== Classification of vaccinia infections ==
In addition to the morbidity of uncomplicated primary vaccination, transfer of infection to other sites by scratching, and  post vaccinial [[encephalitis]], other complications of vaccinia infections may be divided into the following types:&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|391}}

:* [[Generalized vaccinia]]
:* [[Eczema vaccinatum]]
:* [[Progressive vaccinia]] (Vaccinia gangrenosum, Vaccinia necrosum)
:* [[Roseola vaccinia]]

==Origin==
Vaccinia virus is closely related to the virus that causes [[cowpox]]; historically the two were often considered to be one and the same.&lt;ref name=Huygelen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huygelen C |title=Jenner's cowpox vaccine in light of current vaccinology |language=Dutch |journal=Verh. K. Acad. Geneeskd. Belg. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=479–536; discussion 537–8 |year=1996 |pmid=9027132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise origin of vaccinia virus is unknown due to the lack of record-keeping, as the virus was repeatedly cultivated and [[Serial passage|passaged]] in research laboratories for many decades.&lt;ref name=Henderson_1999&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Henderson DA, Moss B |veditors=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA | title = Vaccines | origyear = 1988 | edition = 3rd | year = 1999 | publisher = WB Saunders | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | isbn = 978-0-7216-7443-8 | chapter = Smallpox and Vaccinia | chapterurl = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common notion is that vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and [[variola]] virus (the causative agent of smallpox) were all derived from a common ancestral virus. There is also speculation that vaccinia virus was originally isolated from [[horse]]s,&lt;ref name=Huygelen /&gt; and analysis of DNA from an early (1902) sample of smallpox vaccine showed that it was 99.7% similar to horsepox virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1056/NEJMc1707600|pmid= 29020595|title= An Early American Smallpox Vaccine Based on Horsepox|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 377|issue= 15|pages= 1491–1492|year= 2017|last1= Schrick|first1= Livia|last2= Tausch|first2= Simon H|last3= Dabrowski|first3= P. Wojciech|last4= Damaso|first4= Clarissa R|last5= Esparza|first5= José|last6= Nitsche|first6= Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virology==
Poxviruses are unique among [[DNA virus]]es because they [[DNA replication|replicate]] only in the [[cytoplasm]] of the [[Host (biology)|host cell]], outside of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolonen N, Doglio L, Schleich S, Krijnse Locker J |title=Vaccinia Virus DNA Replication Occurs in Endoplasmic Reticulum-enclosed Cytoplasmic Mini-Nuclei |journal=Mol. Biol. Cell |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=2031–46 |date=1 July 2001|pmid=11452001 |url=http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/content/full/12/7/2031 |pmc=55651 |doi=10.1091/mbc.12.7.2031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the large genome is required for encoding various [[enzymes]] and proteins involved in viral DNA replication and gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. During its replication cycle, VV produces four infectious forms which differ in their outer [[cell membrane|membranes]]: intracellular mature virion (IMV), the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV), the cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV) and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=[[Geoffrey L. Smith|Smith GL]], Vanderplasschen A, Law M |title=The formation and function of extracellular enveloped Vaccinia virus |journal=J. Gen. Virol. |volume=83 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=2915–31 |date=1 December 2002|pmid=12466468 |url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/83/12/2915 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-83-12-2915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the issue remains contentious, the prevailing view is that the IMV consists of a single [[lipoprotein]] membrane, while the CEV and EEV are both surrounded by two membrane layers and the IEV has three envelopes. The IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts. On the other hand, the CEV is believed to play a role in cell-to-cell spread and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organism.

==Multiplicity reactivation==
Vaccinia virus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation (MR).&lt;ref name=Abel&gt;{{cite journal |author=ABEL P |title=Multiplicity reactivation and marker rescue with vaccinia virus |journal=Virology |volume=17 |issue= 4|pages=511–9 |date=August 1962 |pmid=13858909 |doi= 10.1016/0042-6822(62)90150-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MR is the process by which two, or more, virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome.  Abel&lt;ref name=Abel /&gt; found that vaccinia viruses  exposed to doses of UV light sufficient to prevent progeny formation when single virus particles infected host chick embryo cells, could still produce viable progeny viruses when host cells were infected by two or more of these inactivated viruses; that is, MR could occur.  Kim and Sharp demonstrated MR of vaccinia virus after treatment with UV-light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharp DG, Kim KS |title=Multiplicity reactivation and radiation survival of aggregated vaccinia virus.

==Host resistance==
Vaccinia contains within its genome genes for several [[protein]]s that give the virus resistance to [[interferon]]s :
* K3L is a protein with [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to the protein ''[[eIF-2|eukaryotic initiation factor 2]]'' (eIF-2alpha). K3L protein inhibits the action of [[Protein kinase R|PKR]], an activator of interferons.&lt;ref name=Davies1993/&gt; 
* E3L is another protein encoded by Vaccinia. E3L also inhibits PKR activation; and is also able to bind to double stranded RNA.&lt;ref name=Davies1993&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies MV, Chang HW, Jacobs BL, Kaufman RJ |title=The E3L and K3L vaccinia virus gene products stimulate translation through inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase by different mechanisms |journal=J. Virol. |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=1688–92 |date=1 March 1993|pmid=8094759 |pmc=237544 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8094759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as a vaccine==
[[Image:Smallpox vaccine site.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Site of a vaccinia injection, several days later.]]
A Vaccinia virus infection is very mild and is typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, but it may cause a mild rash and [[fever]]. Immune responses generated from a Vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal [[smallpox]] infection. For this reason, Vaccinia virus was, and is still being used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against, the Vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus. However, certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise. The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are [[immunocompromised]]. Approximately one in one million individuals will develop a fatal response to the [[vaccination]].

Currently, the vaccine is only administered to health care workers or research personnel who have a high risk of contracting the [[variola]] virus, and to the military personnel of the [[United States|United States of America]]. Due to the threat of smallpox [[bioterrorism]], there is a possibility the vaccine may have to be widely administered again in the future. Therefore, scientists are currently developing novel vaccine strategies against smallpox which are safer and much faster to deploy during a bioterrorism event.

On September 1, 2007, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) licensed a new [[vaccine]] [[ACAM2000]] against [[smallpox]] which can be produced quickly upon need. Manufactured by [[Sanofi Pasteur]], the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stockpiled 192.5 million doses of the new vaccine (see list of common strains below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/FDA-approves-new-smallpox-vaccine-1833591.php |title=FDA approves new smallpox vaccine |last=Heilprin |first=John |agency=AP |website=Houston Chronicle |date=1 September 2007 |access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new smallpox vaccine, [[Imvanex]], which is based on a modified strain of vaccinia; [[Modified vaccinia Ankara]] was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002596/human_med_001666.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 |title=European public assessment report summary: Imvanex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vaccinia'' is also used in recombinant [[vaccines]], as a vector for expression of foreign genes within a host, in order to generate an immune response. Other [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] are also used as live recombinant vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanderplasschen |first1=A. |last2=Pastoret |first2=P.-P. |title=The Uses of Poxviruses as Vectors |journal=Current Gene Therapy |volume=3 |number=6 |date=December 2003 |pages=583–595 |doi=10.2174/1566523034578168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original vaccine for smallpox, and the origin of the idea of vaccination, was [[Cowpox]], described by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1798. The [[Latin]] term used for Cowpox was ''Variolae vaccinae'',  Jenner's own translation of "smallpox of the cow".  That term lent its name to the whole idea of vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9987167|year=1999|last1=Baxby|first1=D|title=Edward Jenner's Inquiry; a bicentenary analysis|volume=17|issue=4|pages=301–7|journal=Vaccine|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(98)00207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was realized that the virus used in smallpox vaccination was not, or was no longer, the same as cowpox virus, the name 'vaccinia' was used for the virus in smallpox vaccine. (See OED.) Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable. The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight, and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine. Another method employed was the "arm to arm" method. This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms, then to another, etc. This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine, and usually employed orphans as carriers. However, this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases, such as hepatitis and syphilis.  In 1861, 41 Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the arm to arm method.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Jonathan B. "Scourge : The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox." New York: Grove/Atlantic Inc., 2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of pig [[cornea]]l [[tissue culture]].&lt;ref name="Steinhardt_1913"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steinhardt E, Israeli C, Lambert RA | title = Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia | journal = J.

In 1939  [[Allan Watt Downie]] showed that the smallpox vaccines being used in the 20th century and cowpox virus were not the same, but were immunologically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2065307|year=1939|last1=Downie|first1=AW|title=The Immunological Relationship of the Virus of Spontaneous Cowpox to Vaccinia Virus|volume=20|issue=2|pages=158–176|journal=British Journal of Experimental Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tyrrell | first1 = D.

==Recent cases==
In March 2007, a 2-year-old Indiana boy and his mother contracted a life-threatening vaccinia infection from the boy's father.&lt;ref name=MMWR&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Household transmission of vaccinia virus from contact with a military smallpox vaccinee—Illinois and Indiana, 2007 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=56 |issue=19 |pages=478–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17510612 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5619a4.htm?s_cid=mm5619a4_e}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy developed the telltale rash over 80 percent of his body after coming into close contact with his father, who was vaccinated for smallpox before being deployed overseas by the [[United States Army]]. The United States military resumed smallpox vaccinations in 2002. The child acquired the infection due to [[eczema]], which is a known risk factor for vaccinia infection. The boy was treated with [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[cidofovir]], and [[Tecovirimat]] (ST-246), a (then) experimental drug developed by [[SIGA Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = SIGA's Smallpox Drug Candidate Administered to Critically Ill Human Patient | publisher = SIGA Technologies | date = 2007-03-17 | url =https://investor.siga.com/node/7346 | accessdate = 2018-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2007, he was sent home with no after effects except for possible scarring of the skin.&lt;ref name=MMWR/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that a woman in Washington had contracted vaccinia virus infection after digital vaginal contact with her boyfriend, a military member who had recently been vaccinated for smallpox. The woman had a history of childhood eczema, but she had not been symptomatic as an adult. The CDC indicated that it was aware of four similar cases in the preceding 12 months of vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a recent military vaccinee.&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Vaccinia Virus Infection After Sexual Contact with a Military Smallpox Vaccinee—Washington, 2010 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=59 |issue=25 |pages=773–75 |year=2010 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5925a2.htm?s_cid=mm5925a2_w}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further cases—also in patients with a history of eczema—occurred in 2012.&lt;ref name=MMWR3&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee—San Diego, California, 2012 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=145–7 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23446513 |pmc=4604863 |doi= |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6208a2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common strains==
This is a list of some of the well-characterized vaccinia strains used for research and vaccination.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

* Lister (also known as Elstree): the English vaccine strain used by [[Leslie Collier]] to develop heat stable vaccine in powdered form. Used as the basis for vaccine production during the World Health Organization Smallpox Eradication Campaign (SEC)
* [[Dryvax]] (also known as "Wyeth"): the vaccine strain previously used in the [[United States]], produced by [[Wyeth]]. Used in the SEC, it was replaced in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notice to Readers: Newly Licensed Smallpox Vaccine to Replace Old Smallpox Vaccine |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep.|volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=207–8 |date=February 29, 2008 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5708a6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ACAM2000 (see below), produced by Acambis. It was produced as preparations of [[calf (animal)|calf]] [[lymph]] which was [[freeze-dried]] and treated with antibiotics.
* EM63; Russian strain used in the SEC
* [[ACAM2000]]: The current strain in use in the USA, produced by Acambis. ACAM2000 was derived from a [[cloning|clone]] of a Dryvax virus by [[Viral plaque|plaque purification]]. It is produced in cultures of [[Vero cells]].
* [[Modified vaccinia Ankara]] (also known as MVA): a highly attenuated (not virulent) strain created by passaging vaccinia virus several hundred times in [[chicken]] [[embryo]] [[fibroblasts]]. Unlike some other vaccinia strains it does not make [[immunodeficient]] [[Laboratory mouse|mice]] sick and therefore may be safer to use in humans who have weaker immune systems due to being very young, very old, having [[HIV/AIDS]], etc.
* LC16m8: an attenuated strain developed and currently used in Japan
* CV-1: an attenuated strain developed in the United States and used there in the late 1960s- 1970s
* Western Reserve
* Copenhagen
* Connaught Laboratories (Canada)

== History ==
Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is named after former educator, politician, and school administrator, [[Vernon Malone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/wake-ed-blog/article10284485.html|title=Wake County names new high school after Vernon Malone|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone was consequential in merging Wake County Public Schools and Raleigh schools, ending [[racial segregation]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/article200805494.html|title=Leader in merger of Wake County and Raleigh schools, Roy Tilley, dies|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the name for the college and career academy, the Wake County [[board of education]] unanimously passed a resolution signifying their support for the school to be named after Malone, who had formerly served as the first Chairman for Wake County Public Schools following the merger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The inaugural principal when the school opened in 2014, was Dr. Ashlie Thompson.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article10067285.html|title=New Wake County technical high school short on students|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcpss.net/Page/266|title=Superintendent / Area Superintendents|website=www.wcpss.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since left the position and now serves as an Area Superintendent for Wake County Public Schools in the district that Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Wheeler James North''' (January 2, 1922 – December 20, 2002), born in [[San Francisco, California]], was a marine biologist and [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He is best known for his pioneering work to understand the ecology of California’s coastal kelp forests, and pioneering work in biomass fuels and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

== Early life, military service and education ==
North was born January 2, 1922 in San Francisco to Wheeler O. and Florence (Ross) North, and grew up at a mining camp at La Fe in [[Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]], as his father was a mining engineer and his mother was an assay chemist.  In 1927, the family moved to [[La Jolla, California]].  In 1940 North graduated from [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]] and entered college at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).  While still in college in December 1942, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]], which allowed him to complete his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1944.  After training in U.S. Army [[Officers Candidate School]] at [[Fort Monmouth]] in New Jersey, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Signal Corps and assigned to the [[Philippines]].  However, he arrived in Southeast Asia after [[VJ Day]] in August 1945 but stayed in the Philippines and [[Japan]] as part of the American occupying forces until August 1946.  After two years working with the U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory in [[San Diego]], North returned to Caltech in September 1948 and completed a second bachelor's degree in biology in 1950.  He earned masters and Ph.D. degrees in [[Biological Oceanography]] at the [[University of California]] [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in 1953 studying in the laboratory of Denis Fox.  He undertook postdoctoral work with a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship at the [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]] and [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/00/OH_North_W.pdf | title= Wheeler J. North oral history (1998) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
North began his academic career teaching at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1953, after which he joined the faculty of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in September 1962.  Although North taught [[marine biology]] courses at the Caltech main campus in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], he spent much of his time undertaking research at the Caltech’s [[Kerckhoff marine laboratory|Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] in [[Corona Del Mar, California|Corona del Mar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/LXVI/north.html| title= Wheeler J. North (1922-2002) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North’s principal research interest was [[marine ecology]], specifically the kelp beds off Southern California and the [[population ecology]] of sea urchins. He studied the effects of sewage outfalls and [[El Niño]] on [[kelp forests]], and the predation of kelp by [[sea urchins]].  He served as a consultant for California’s kelp-harvesting industry.  He was one of the first marine scientists to employ [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] technology for marine research beginning as a student in 1949.  While at Scripps, he worked with group studying the physiology of diving and was a pioneer in establishing scientific diving safety protocols.  He was a consulting scientist after the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and after [[1973 oil crisis]], he studied the possibility of [[kelp| kelp farms]] to produce [[Algae fuel|biomass]] as an alternative fuel.  He contributed to the growth of the [[Kelp#Commercial kelp production in China|kelp farming]] industry in China.  He also studied the ecological effects of warm-water discharges from [[nuclear power plants]] on kelp forests, and in the early 1990s he undertook studies to reduce atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] using [[Biomass (ecology)|marine biomass]] and [[clathrate hydrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/|title=Interview with Wheeler J.
