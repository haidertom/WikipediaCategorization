The image first achieved notability when published as a [[chromolithograph]] by [[Currier and Ives]]. After the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933, Currier and Ives licensed the image to the makers of [[Southern Comfort]], who continued to use the lithograph on their liqueur labels until 2010.&lt;ref name="tap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2010/5/19/before-after-southern-comfort-rebranding.html "Before &amp; After: Southern Comfort Rebranding" ''The Dieline'', May 19, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Woodland Plantation, which is registered on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], now provides [[bed-and-breakfast]] accommodation.

'''Abraham Straski''' (1903 &amp;ndash; 1987) was a [[Poland|Polish]] born [[Painting|painter]] who moved to the [[United States]] after surviving the [[Nazi]] concentrations camps in the [[Holocaust]]. His works are usually representations of [[rabbis]] done in warm, rich colors.

==Life==

Straski was raised in pre-World War II Europe as a devout follower of the Jewish faith.  While growing up, he grew close to Rabbis in his community who taught him [[violin]], [[cello]], and the [[Torah]]. He drew his inspiration for art from the Rabbis surrounding him in his local community.  During [[World War II]], his family was forced into a concentration camp.

While in the camps, Straski whenever possible saved small pieces of scrap paper and made thumbnail sketches of his teachers who he vowed would never be forgotten. It is said "he kept his sanity by painting the Rabbis of his youth.".&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=2003 | title=Jewish art, photography &amp; artifacts on exhibit at Chicago Fine Arts | work=THEATRE BUILDING CHICAGO DEBUTS 27TH SEASON | publisher=Theater Building Chicago | url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/artchicago/message/264 | accessdate=17 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Pratt'''  (5 December 1806 – 1893) was a botanical and ornithological illustrator and author from [[Strood]], Kent. The second of three daughters of Robert Pratt (1777–1819), a grocer, and Sara Bundock (1780–1845), Pratt was one of the best known English botanical illustrators of the Victorian age.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; Owing to poor health and a 'stiff knee' in childhood, she missed out on 'outdoor activities' and was encouraged to occupy herself by drawing. Anne Pratt was educated at Eastgate House, [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and introduced to botany by Dr. Dods, a family friend.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; She moved to Brixton, London, in 1826, where she developed her career as an illustrator. She settled in [[Dover]] in 1849, then in [[East Grinstead]] in 1866, where she married John Pearless; they then moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]]. Anne Pratt died in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London.

Anne Pratt wrote more than 20 books, which she illustrated with [[chromolithograph]]s on which she collaborated with [[William Dickes]], an engraver skilled in the chromolithograph process. Her works were written in popular style but were said to be accurate, and are partly responsible for the popularising of botany in her day. From her first book, ''Flowers and Their Associations'', her work sold well, but she never achieved critical acclaim, owing to prejudice against her on the grounds that she was self-taught.&lt;ref name=acclaim/&gt; Her masterpiece is probably ''The Flowering Plants, Grasses, Sedges, and Ferns of Great Britain and Their Allies the Club Mosses, Pepperworts, and Horsetails'', a six-volume project covering more than 1500 species, with 300 illustrations, that took over a decade to publish in full (1855–1873). This work had a remarkably long life as a standard reference work: the illustrations of ferns in the final volume continued to be used into the second half of the twentieth century, appearing, unattributed and in very much reduced in size and in half tone, in the ''Observer's Book of [British] Ferns'' &lt;ref&gt; ''The Observer's Book of Ferns''
compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, no date; ''The Observer's Book of British Ferns'' compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, 1950. &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashkenaz''' is a live music and dance venue located in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in the [[United States]]. It is a [[non-profit]] organization. It focuses on [[world music]]. In 2011 it was voted the best place to dance by readers of ''[[East Bay Express]]''.&lt;ref name=EBE1&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers' Poll Winners: Arts and Culture|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/readers-poll-winners-arts-and-culture/BestOf?oid=2928575&amp;keywords=|work=Best of the East Bay|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Ashkenaz opened in 1973 and was founded by [[performance artist]] and activist [[David Nadel]]. After relocating from [[Los Angeles]] to attend [[University of California, Berkeley]], Nadel formed a [[dance troupe]]. The troupe started renting spaces on [[San Pablo Avenue]]. Nadel, along with six other people, would go on to buy the building where Ashkenaz is located today. He named the organization after his [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] ancestry. The original building was a series of old retail shops. Nadel and friends built the wooden facade that is seen today.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; It is supposed to resemble an [[Eastern European]] [[synagogue]].&lt;ref name=EBE2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashkenaz|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/ashkenaz/Location?oid=1109232|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It totals 5,000 square feet.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Eli|title=A Place Called Ashkenaz|url=http://forward.com/articles/12917/a-place-called-ashkenaz-/|work=Arts &amp; Culture|publisher=Forward|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the city of Berkeley named the Ashkenaz a [[List of Berkeley Landmarks, Structures of Merit, and Historic Districts|city landmark]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Leslie|title=Slain Ashkenaz owner recalled for his sense of justice|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/4790/slain-ashkenaz-owner-recalled-for-his-sense-of-justice/|work=Local|publisher=J Weekly|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a drunken patron was kicked out of the club by Nadel. The patron threatened to shoot Nadel. The man returned after Nadel closed the club for the evening and shot Nadel [[point blank]] in the head. Nadel died from the gunshot wound at the hospital and the man was never found. In wake of Nadel dying, a group of Ashkenaz patrons bought it, and then formed it into a nonprofit.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=Robert|title=Ashkenaz provides music, “living room” for activists|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/07/21/ashkenaz-provides-music-dance-living-room-for-activists/|work=Berkeley History|publisher=Berkeleyside|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened six months later, on June 21, 1997.&lt;ref name=Bowman/&gt;

==Today==
It caters to [[world music]], both local and international. Music genres range from [[hip-hop]] to [[Cajun music]].&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They also host events focused around [[Judaism]], including holiday celebrations and [[klezmer]] concerts.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt; The majority of concerts start with a [[dancing|dance lessons]] based around the style or genre of the music.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They host benefits for local organizations and activists, such as the [[American Indian Movement]] and [[Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowman|first=Catherine|title=Ashkenaz Reborn 6 Months After Owner's Slaying|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ashkenaz-Reborn-6-Months-After-Owner-s-Slaying-2822075.php|work=News|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=14 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization aims to be a [[zero waste]] business. They recycle everything and provide customers glasses of water instead of [[water bottles]]. They have a television program on [[Berkeley Community Television]] called ''Ashkenaz Live,'' where they showcase performances and history of the performers genres. Ashkenaz has a live children's program where musicians play to local children on Sundays.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The venue has a stage, alcohol serving bar, a dance studio, and a [[vegetarian]] restaurant. A space upstairs where Nadel used to live is an office space.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">A '''''badchen''''' or '''''badkhn''''' (a Hebrew word meaning [[jester]] that has been Yiddishized as ''badchen'') is a [[Jewish]] comedian with scholarly overtones who entertained guests at weddings among the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] of [[Eastern Europe]]. Today they are found in all countries with [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidic]] populations, including the [[United States]], performing their [[shtick]] at weddings.

The ''badchen'' was considered a standard part of the wedding party, as ''de rigueur'' as the officiating [[rabbi]]. An elaborate traditional wedding might also involve a ''letz'' (lit. a clown, here a ''jongleur'' or musician) and a ''marshalik'' (a master of ceremonies).&lt;ref name=Liptzin&gt;[[Sol Liptzin|Liptzin, Sol]], ''A History of Yiddish Literature'', Jonathan David Publishers, Middle Village, NY, 1972, {{ISBN|0-8246-0124-6}}, 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''badchen'' has to be able both to provide the energy for a party before and after the ceremony itself and also to make the transition to a more serious tone immediately before the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Liptzin/&gt;  To this end his comedy was not of a [[slapstick]] variety but rather verbal with many intricate [[Talmud]]ic references and [[in-joke]]s.

Following the Council of Vilna on July 3, 1661, a decree was issued banning merry-making, including the setting of limitations on wedding celebrations, public drinking, fire dances, masquerades, and Jewish comic entertainers. The ''badchen'' was exempted from the decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gordon | first = Mel | title = Catastrophe in Ukraine, Comedy Today | newspaper = Reform Judaism | pages = 50–51 | date = Spring 2011 | accessdate = 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous ''badchonim'' include [[Chaim Menachem Mermelstien|Chaim Menachem (Mendel) Mermelstein]] (born March 2, 1920 in [[Mukachevo|Munkacz]], died November 7, 1985 in [[New York City|New York]]), considered the father of modern-day ''badchonus'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the present-day performers [[Yankel Miller]] and [[Yoel Lebowits]].

The 19th-century [[Broder singer]]s began as ''badchonim'', but soon started to perform outside of the context of weddings. They, in turn, are usually seen as the forerunners of [[Yiddish theater]].

On the Jewish holiday of [[Purim]] many young men undertake to be ''badchonim'' during [[Purim spiel]]s.

==Plot==
Karim (Mahbub Alam) is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi working in an industrial laundry. An intellectual whose academic degree was not recognized in South Korea, Karim's work permit is about to expire and he's still owed a year's pay by a previous employer, Shin (Jung Dong-gyu), who's not taking his calls; meanwhile, his wife back home is giving him a hard time about money problems.

Seventeen-year-old high schooler Min-seo ([[Baek Jin-hee]]) is a social loner at odds with her mother, Eun-joo ([[Lee Il-hwa]]), who has a jobless, live-in lover, Ki-hong ([[Park Hyuk-kwon]]), whom she's planning to marry. Minseo's friends all take after-school classes at study institutes, but her single mother can't afford to pay for them. She eventually gets an under the table job at a massage parlor in order to pay for English classes.

On the first day of summer vacation, Min-seo is riding the bus when Karim drops his wallet. He exits the bus, and Min-seo takes the wallet for herself. However, Karim soon realizes what happens and manages to chase Min-seo down in a side street. "Let's go to the police station," he says in excellent Korean, but Min-seo tries to dissuade Karim from reporting her to the police by offering to grant him a favor, and reluctantly agrees to help track down his former boss. As the unlikely pair pose as loan sharks, they find themselves transforming each other's worlds in unexpected ways. They slowly form a mutual understanding, with the girl asking indiscreet questions and the gentleman preaching about problems in South Korean society. For Min-seo, Karim is initially a convenient badge she can wear in a society she sees herself at war with. But as she lowers her defenses, the relationship touchingly turns into a friendship between two lonely souls. But Karim's visa will not last forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Bandhobi|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941534/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2012-12-04|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=Bandhobi|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm09.html#bandhobi|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Barrel Vault.jpg|thumb|[[The Cloisters]], [[New York City]]]]
A '''barrel vault''', also known as a '''tunnel vault''' or a '''wagon vault''', is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, in the case of a pointed barrel vault) along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The barrel vault is the simplest form of a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]: effectively a series of [[arch]]es placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of [[barrel roof]].

As with all [[arch]]-based constructions, there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted [[nave]]s ran parallel down the length of the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by [[buttress]]ing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a [[groin vault]].

Barrel vaults are known from [[Ancient Egypt]], and were used extensively in [[Roman architecture]]. They were also used to replace the [[Cloaca Maxima]] with a system of underground sewers. Other early barrel vault designs occur in northern [[Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[Morocco]], and other regions. In [[medieval]] Europe, the barrel vault was an important element of stone construction in [[monastery|monasteries]], [[castle]]s, [[tower house]]s and other structures. This form of design is observed in [[basement|cellar]]s, [[crypt]]s, long [[hallway]]s, [[cloister]]s and even [[great hall]]s.

==Theory and early history==
[[File:Villa Rustica Ahrweiler Kleiner Raum östlich des Korridors.jpg|thumb|Roman barrel vault at the ''villa rustica'' Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Germany.]]
Barrel vaulting was known and utilized by early civilizations, including [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. However, it apparently was not a very popular or common method of construction within these civilizations. The Persians and the Romans were the first to make significant architectural use of them. The technique probably evolved out of necessity to roof buildings with masonry elements such as bricks or stone blocks in areas where timber and wood were scarce. The earliest known example of a vault is a [[tunnel vault]] found under the [[Sumer]]ian [[ziggurat]] at [[Nippur]] in [[Babylonia]], ascribed to about 4000 BC, which was built of burnt bricks amalgamated with [[clay]] [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The earliest tunnel vaults in Egypt are found at [[Requagnah]] and [[Denderah]], from around 3500 BC in the [[Prehistoric Egypt|predynastic]] era. These were built with [[mudbrick|sun-dried brick]] in three rings over passages descending to [[tomb]]s: in these cases, as the [[span (architecture)|span]] of the vault was only two metres. In these early instances, the barrel vault was chiefly used for underground  structures such as drains and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, though several buildings of the great Late Egyptian [[mortuary]] [[palace]]-[[temple]] of [[Ramesseum]] were also vaulted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Wildung, ''Egypt, From Prehistory to the Romans'', Taschen, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[archaeological]] evidence discovered at the [[Morgantina]] site (in the province of [[Enna]]) shows that the aboveground barrel vault was known and used in Hellenistic [[Sicily]] in 3rd Century BC, indicating that the technique was also known to [[Ancient Greek]]s.

Ancient Romans most probably inherited their knowledge of barrel vaulting from [[Etruscans]] and the Near East. Persians and Romans were the first to use this building method extensively on large-scale projects and were probably the first to use [[scaffold]]ing to aid them in construction of vaults spanning over widths greater than anything seen before. However, Roman builders gradually began to prefer the use of [[groin vault]]; though more complex to erect, this type of vault did not require heavy, thick walls for support (see below), and thus allowed for more spacious buildings with greater openings and much more light inside, such as ''[[thermae]]''.

After the fall of the [[Roman empire]], few buildings large enough to require much in the way of vaulting were built for several centuries. In the early [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period, a return to stone barrel vaults was seen for the first great cathedrals; their interiors were fairly dark, due to thick, heavy walls needed to support the vault. One of the largest and most famous churches enclosed from above by a vast barrel vault was the church of [[Cluny Abbey]], built between the 11th and 12th centuries.

In 13th and 14th Century, with the advance of the new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, barrel vaulting became almost extinct in constructions of great Gothic cathedrals; [[groin vault]]s reinforced by stone ribs were mostly used in the beginning, and later on various types of spectacular, ornate and complex medieval vaults were developed. However, with the coming of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]] style, and revived interest in art and architecture of antiquity, barrel vaulting was re-introduced on a truly grandiose scale, and employed in the construction of many famous buildings and churches, such as [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova]] by [[Leone Battista Alberti]], [[San Giorgio Maggiore]] by [[Andrea Palladio]], and perhaps most glorious of all, [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, where a huge barrel vault spans the {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}-wide nave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpetersbasilica.org/Interior/Nave/Nave.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014094936/http://www.stpetersbasilica.org/Interior/Nave/Nave.htm |archivedate=2006-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a barrel vault design the vectors of pressure result in a downward force on the crown while the lower portions of the arches realise a lateral force pushing outwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mtdavis/222/barrelvault.html |title=Mount Holyoke college, The Art of Cathedrals: Stresses in barrel vaulted design |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502051410/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mtdavis/222/barrelvault.html |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an outcome this form of design is subject to failure unless the sides are anchored or buttressed to very heavy building elements or substantial earthwork sidings.  For example, at [[Muchalls Castle]] in [[Scotland]] adjacent walls to the barrel vaulted chambers are up to 4,6 meters (15&amp;nbsp;feet) thick, adding the buttressing strength needed to secure the curved design.

[[Image:Barrel vault top force.jpg|thumb|left|Pointed barrel vault showing direction of lateral forces.]]
The inherent difficulty of adequately lighting barrel vaulted structures has been widely acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Ragette, ''Traditional Domestic Architecture of the Arab Region'', American University of Shadah (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
The intrinsic engineering issue is the need to avoid [[window|fenestration]] punctures in stonework barrel vaults. Such openings could compromise the integrity of the entire arch system.  Thus the Romanesque medieval builders had to resort to techniques of small windows, large buttresses, or other forms of interior wall cross-bracing to achieve the desired lighting outcomes.  In many of the monasteries, a natural solution was cloisters which could have high barrel-vaulted construction with an open courtyard to allow ample lighting.

Since 1996 [[structural engineer]]s have applied [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian mechanics to calculate numeric stress loads for ancient stonework barrel vaults.&lt;ref&gt;Gui-Rong Liu, ''Mesh Free Methods: Moving Beyond the [[Finite element analysis|Finite Element]] Method'', CRC Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  These analyses have typically used a [[finite element]] algorithm to calculate gravity induced stresses from the self weight of an arched system.  In fact, for structural engineers, analysis of the barrel vault has become a benchmark test of a structural engineering [[computer model]] "because of the complex membrane and inextensional bending states of stress" involved.

In terms of comparison to other vaulting techniques, the barrel vault is inherently a weaker design compared to the more complex [[groin vault]]. The barrel vault structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin vault design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the apexes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scott, ''The Gothic Enterprise: A Guide to Understanding the Medieval Cathedral'' University of California Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In unconventional usage==
Beyond the classical use of the barrel vault in macro-architectural design (e.g. as a major structural roofing element), there are a variety of derivative applications clearly based on the original concept and shape of the barrel vault.  These applications arise in the fields of [[surgery]], [[skylight (window)|skylight]] design, children's toys and microstructure design (such as bus shelters).  While none of these applications rival the majesty of the ancient and Classical predecessors, they demonstrate the pervasiveness of the barrel vault as an architectural concept in contemporary times.

In the field of bone surgery the technique of a "barrel vault" shaped incision is not only a well-defined [[state-of-the-art]] surgical procedure, but the name ''barrel vault'' is given to this technique by [[orthopedic]] [[surgeon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A. Wohlfahrt, P. Heppt, A. Goldmann and P. Wirtz, ''High tibial barrel-vault osteotomy. A clinical study and statistical analysis of 91 long-term results'' PZ Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb. 1991 Jan-Feb;129(1):72-9&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wohlfahrt study cited documents results of this surgical procedure on the human [[tibia]] in 91 such operations.

The '''Bell of King Seongdeok''' is a massive [[bronze]] [[bell (instrument)|bell]], the largest extant bell in [[Korea]]. The full Korean name means ''"Sacred (or Divine) Bell of King Seongdeok the Great."'' It was also known as the '''Emile Bell''', after a [[#Legend|legend about its casting]], and as the '''Bell of [[Bongdeoksa]] Temple''', where it was first housed.

The bell was commissioned by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] to honor his father, [[Seongdeok of Silla|King Seongdeok]]. However, King Gyeongdeok never lived to see the casting of the bell, as he died in 765 A.D. The bell was finally cast in 771 A.D., during the reign of Gyeongdeok's son, [[Hyegong of Silla|King Hyegong]].

Now stored in the [[Gyeongju National Museum|National Museum]] of [[Gyeongju]], the bell was designated as the 29th [[national treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. It measures 3.33 meters high, 2.27 meters in diameter, and 11 to 25 centimeters in wall thickness. The Gyeongju National Museum weighed it in 1997, and found that its weight was 18.9 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Official Site of Korea Tourism: [http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=804389 The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok]&lt;/ref&gt;

When rung, it is said to have been heard from 40 miles away on a clear day..{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[image:National Museum-Emile Bell - Gyeongju 3780-06.JPG|thumb|]]
The bell is considered a masterpiece of [[Unified Silla]] art. It is unique among Korean bronze bells because of the presence of a small hollow tube near the hook. The whole structure, including its decorative elements, produces a wide range of sound frequencies; the tube absorbes high frequency waves, contributing to a distinctive [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]].&lt;ref&gt;Beat Maps of King Song-Dok Bell, Beat Map Drawing Method of Bell Type Structures and Beat Maps of the King Seong-deok Divine Bell by Kim Seok Hyun. http://www.ndsl.kr/ Another article can search at JSV 2005.3 by Yi JangMu and Yi CiUk&lt;/ref&gt;

The hook of the bell is in the shape of a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'s head. There are many relief patterns on the bell, including are flower patterns along the rim and shoulder. There are also reliefs of [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flowers, grass reliefs, and a pair of two ''[[apsaras]]es'' (heavenly maidens). The striking point of the bell (''dwangja'') is also in the shape of a lotus and sits between two of the apsarases reliefs. The bottom of the bell is in a [[rhombus|rhombic]] shape, lending it a look unique among bells of [[Orient|the Orient]].

The inscriptions on the bell, over a thousand [[hanja]], are a fine example of [[Korean calligraphy]] and carving. They provide detailed information about the bell and why it was cast.

The column the bell hangs on is quite firm. Even a column made with the same diameter, out of modern [[alloy]] might bend by weight of the bell, yet the bell still hangs on an ancient column that has lasted for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;나의 문화유산답사기(literally ''My Cultural Heritage Exploration''.) book 3 chapter 9, by Yu HengJun&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The bell is commonly known as the '''Emile Bell''' in both Korean and English. ''Emile'', pronounced "em-ee-leh," is an ancient [[Silla]] term for "mommy".

According to legend, the first bell that was cast produced no sound when it was struck. The bell was recast many times but with no success. The king that had wanted the bell cast died after a while and his young son took over with the help of the queen. The son carried out what his father had started but still he didn't have any success. Later, a monk dreamed that if a child was cast into the metal, the bell would ring. The monk then took a child from the village and had her cast into the metal. When the bell was complete, the bell made the most beautiful sound when struck.

Some, however, believe the legend may actually be a modern invention, and that the story and name originated in the 1920s. A story that was published about the "Eomilne bell" or "Earmilne bell" (어밀네 종) may have been distorted in retelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://cha.korea.kr/gonews/branch.do?act=detailView&amp;type=news&amp;sectionId=co_sec_1&amp;categoryId=&amp;dataId=155312736 (Korean), also fiction section of the '매일신보(Official newspaper of the [[Governor-General of Korea]], published by the Japanese colonial government). One picture of the link is original text of Earmilne bell. Opponents reference is 326 page of ''The Passing of Korea'' (Homer Bezaleel Hulbert, 1906, a story about other bell in Seoul and Japanese records about 1920).&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent argument is that legend about other bell became confused with the legend of the Emile bell.&lt;ref&gt;326 page of The Passing of Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://orumi.egloos.com/4061904 (Korean) References of this post is a article of journal called Byeolgungon(별건곤, 別乾坤), 23rd(1929.9.27).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulbert, "The Korean Legend on the 'Spirit of the Bell'" (''The Korean Review'', 1901), Constance J. D. Coulson, "The Sight of Seoul" (''Korea'', 1910), Frank Elias, "Korea-chapter4 (Places, Bells, and Dogs)" (''The Far East (China, Korea, Japan)'', 1911), E. M.

The '''Bernie Grant Arts Centre''' (BGAC) is a £15 million purpose-built multi-[[arts centre]], which includes a 274-seat [[auditorium]], studio/rehearsal space, café/bar, enterprise centre and open spaces. It is located next to the Town Hall in [[Tottenham]], [[North London]]. The centre was designed by [[David Adjaye]] and opened in September 2007. According to its proclaimed aims:

:“The BGAC aspires to be a nationally and internationally recognised centre for the development of diverse cultural and creative practitioners, which has a demonstrably positive impact on the quality of life of local communities. The vision of the centre as an organisation dedicated to making a substantial contribution to the social and economic regeneration of Tottenham is a key objective of the organisation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berniegrantcentre.co.uk/index.php?pid=91 "About the Centre", Bernie Grant Arts Centre website.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:
The centre organises [[performance]]s, [[exhibition]]s, [[film]]s, courses and festivals. It also houses and supports and number of start-up creative enterprises in its purpose-built Enterprise Centre with 20 units.

It is funded by the [[London Borough of Haringey]] and the [[Arts Council]].

It is named in honour of [[Bernie Grant]], MP, who represented the area. It was an initiative started before his death in 2000, through which he aspired to create "a unique showcase for international multicultural talent". Visiting the BGAC on 11 August 2010, Culture minister [[Ed Vaizey]] MP said: "What I have seen today is fantastic. It is a working example of how a community space can bring opportunities to the many people who want to work in creative industries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/8327428.Culture_minister_tours_Bernie_Grant_Arts_Centre/ Elizabeth Pears, "Culture minister tours Bernie Grant Arts Centre", ''Haringey Independent'', 12 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in Afghanistan ==
Aisha suffered early in life, losing her mother and forced into marriage as a teenager.&lt;ref name="CNN2012" /&gt; In a practice known as [[baad (practice)|baad]], Aisha's father promised her to a [[Taliban]] fighter when she was 12 years old as compensation for a killing that a member of her family had committed.

== Life in the United States ==
Shortly after ''Time'''s cover ran in August 2010, Aisha was flown to the United States to receive free [[reconstructive surgery]].&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; After arriving in [[California]], she psychologically regressed into performing fake seizures, tantrums, and [[self-harm]] that required hospitalization. Surgeons concluded that she was not "emotionally prepared" to handle the patient responsibilities in the reconstructive surgery process, and her psychologist diagnosed her with [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/05/world/saving.aesha/?hpt=hp_c2 | work=CNN | title=Saving Aesha}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her reconstructive surgery was delayed, she was taken in by the [[Women for Afghan Women]] shelter in [[Queens, New York]], but she caused many problems for the staff and other residents, including roommates hired by the shelter to live with her.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha's condition improved with a change in medications, and the seizures stopped.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

Later, Aisha's psychological condition improved enough that she was able to cease taking medications to control her behavior. Starting in 2012, preparations to do a multistage facial reconstruction for Aisha began.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Her forehead was expanded over the course of several months to provide enough tissue to build a new nose. The structure for her new nose was built using cartilage from her own body and tissue from her left hand was also used for the inner lining.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha underwent a total of 12 completed surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w Video chronicling her surgery by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (Nov 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[ABC News]] revisited Aisha and revealed her new nose that has altered her appearance. Aisha has been adopted by an Afghan-American couple, and lives in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBeakiLzNY "Meet Aesha, a Symbol of Strength and Triumph" ABC News video (July 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=American Society of Plastic Surgeons ASPS|title=Patients of Courage {{!}} Bibi Aisha|date=2014-11-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w|accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studies English and mathematics and aspires to be a police officer.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

The '''Bicentenary Medal'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/medals/bicentenary-medal |title=The Bicentenary Medal |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]], London, UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608200825/http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/medals/bicentenary-medal |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] is awarded to "a person who, in a manner other than as an industrial designer, has applied art and design in great effect as instruments of civic innovation", as long as the winner is not already "bedecked with medals".  It was first awarded in 1954, on the bicentenary of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], and continues to be awarded annually with exceptions in 2003, 2006 and 2012.

The Medal was instituted in 1954 to commemorate the founding of the RSA over two hundred years earlier, and has been awarded to a variety of individuals for their outstanding contributions to the advancement of design in industry and society.  In the RSA's current account of design, that contribution is interpreted as the most effective use of design to increase the resourcefulness of people and communities.

Founded in 1855, the '''Amateur Dramatic Club''' (or ADC) is the oldest university dramatic society in [[England]] – and the largest dramatic society in [[Cambridge]].

The club stages a diverse range of productions every term, many of them at the fully equipped [[ADC Theatre]] in Park Street, where they are the resident company. They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad.

==History==

The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by [[F. C. Burnand|F.C. Burnand]] and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year.
The university’s response to the project was reported to have been ‘unfavourable’, but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved.
The club’s first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club’s first minute book reports that ‘the receipts were scanty, but a start was effected’.

Over the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily.
A contribution of £5 from each of the club’s members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened.

Though the university’s approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group.
Tragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire.
Support flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club.
The [[ADC Theatre]], now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn.

The club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adctheatre.com/potted.asp A Potted History of the ADC Theatre]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater [[ADC Theatre]], where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the [[Corpus Christi Playroom]], The Octagon at St Chad’s, King's College Lawn and the [[The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge|Round Church]].

Constitutionally, the club also has an obligation
&lt;blockquote&gt;to spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC Theatre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late-night experimental pieces known as One Night Stands.

==Membership==
Anybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the [[University of Cambridge]], or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;[http://cuadc.org/about-us/constitution/ CUADC Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
From time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership.
It is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons.

==Committee==
The club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university.
The President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term.
The committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual [[garden party]], annual dinner, and freshers' squash.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

There is also a senior treasurer, who, by university statutes, must be a senior member of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2008/chapter02-section17.html#heading2-19 Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge: Chapter Ii :  Matriculation, Residence, Admission to Degrees, Discipline  –  Discipline]&lt;/ref&gt; This post is currently held by Dr Richard Barnes, the vice-master of Emmanuel College and senior treasurer of Amalgamated Clubs.

The '''Cancún Underwater Museum''' ({{lang-es|'''Museo Subacuático de Arte'''}}, known as '''MUSA''') is a non-profit organization based in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]] devoted to the art of conservation. The museum has a total of 500 sculptures, most by the British sculptor [[Jason deCaires Taylor]] and the others by five Mexican sculptors,&lt;ref name=Perdomo&gt;Perdomo, Gabriela. "Is Art Better down Where It’s Wetter?" Maclean’s 125, no. 9 (March 12, 2012): 82–82.&lt;/ref&gt; with three different galleries submerged between three and six meters deep in the ocean at the [[Cancún National Marine Park]]. The museum was thought up by Marine Park Director Jaime Gonzalez Canto, with Taylor's assistance, with the objective of saving the nearby coral reefs by providing an alternative destination for divers.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;Vance, Erik. "The Art of Distraction". Scientific American 309, no. 2 (August 2013): 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/2010/10/101012_strand_jasondecairestaylor.shtml "Underwater sculpture saving coral reefs"]. BBC World Service, October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was started in 2009 and officially opened in November 2010.

==History==
At the beginning of 2008, Jaime Gonzalez Canto and Jason deCaires Taylor began to create the plans for an underwater museum that would be formed by nature into a coral reef.&lt;ref name=Perdomo/&gt;
 
Dr. Jaime González Miki, the Director of the National Park Costa Occidental Isla Mujeres, Punta Cancún y Punta Nizuc, saw that the natural coral reefs were being damaged by tourists, anchors, and divers. In particular the largest coral reef in Cancún, [[Manchones Reef]], was receiving the most damage because it is the most often visited by divers and [[snorkeler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Robert. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/portfolio-jason-decaires-taylors-silent-evolution-underwater-sculptures-9191301.html "Portfolio: Jason deCaires Taylor’s 'Silent Evolution' Underwater Sculptures"]. The Independent. March 15, 2014. Accessed January 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2005 González Canto suggested to the then President of the Cancún Nautical Association, Roberto Díaz Abraham, the idea of taking snorkelers and divers to an area where concrete reefs with some corals had been placed, to draw them away from Manchones reef. By January 2008, Díaz Abraham walked away from the project, believing that it would take many more years for the artificial coral gardens to flourish and become an attraction, but González Canto persisted. Pursuing research on artificial reefs, he came across Taylor, who had been pioneering the use of underwater sculptures for the creation of artificial reefs on a project in [[Grenada]] that demonstrated the value of art in conservation, the [[Molinere Underwater Sculpture Park]]. He was a diving instructor in the Caribbean at the time, which also allowed him to see art in a different way.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

Roberto Diaz Abraham agreed to the plan for Taylor to create an underwater sculpture museum. MUSA was created and Taylor was contracted to do the initial work installing almost 500 sculptures, with the others by Mexican sculptors. The first four sculptures were placed underwater in November 2009,&lt;ref name=Shah&gt;Shah, Dhruti. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8326593.stm "Mexico's 'giant underwater museum'"]. BBC News, November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and most of Taylor's ''The Silent Evolution'' had been installed by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="sport diver"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2010|title=Dive Briefs — Curious Company|journal=Sport Diver|publisher=PADI|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.smh.com.au/lifestyle/essentials/cancun-underwater-museum-1006113.html|title=Cancun underwater museum|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;Faerber, Fritz. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/pictures/110105-underwater-sculpture-park-garden-cancun-mexico-caribbean-pictures-photos-science/#/underwater-sculpture-park-cancun-mexico-installing_30887_600x450.jpg "Pictures: 'Bodies' Fill Underwater Sculpture Park"]. National Geographic, January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum officially opened on November 27, 2010, shortly before the start of the [[Cancún climate summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturevideo/artvideo/8056214/Underwater-sculpture-park-set-to-open-near-Cancun.html "Underwater sculpture park set to open near Cancun"]. The Telegraph, October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Sophie, Agence France-Presse. [http://coral.org/node/5064 "Art Attracts Fish in Underwater Mexican Museum"], at Coral.org, November 11, 2010, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415114918/http://www.coral.org/node/5064 archived] at the Wayback Machine, April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2013, five years after the foundation of MUSA, a total of 500 concrete sculptures had been placed on the ocean floor, 487 by Taylor and the rest by five Mexican artists. 477 are exhibited in the Manchones gallery and 23 in the Nizuc gallery. In addition, 26 replicas and one original are located at a visitor center at Plaza Kukulcán, a mall in the hotel zone of Cancún. More than 100,000 visitors, out of 500,000 that visited the Government Protected Area, visited MUSA during 2013.

==Museum==
MUSA obtained a permit to sink 1,200 structures in 10 different areas within the National Marine Park. So far only two have been developed, Manchones reef with 477 sculptures and Punta Nizuc with 23 structures. A new installation by Cuban sculptor Elier Amado Gil, ''Blessings'', is to be placed in a new gallery called Chitales. Snorkelers, scuba divers, and tourists can visit the underwater exhibits via a [[glass-bottom boat]].

To place the statues on the ocean floor, Taylor had a special lift made for the statues so none would be damaged during the move. A forty-ton crane was placed on a commercial ferry in order to lower the sculptures. Some are so heavy that they had to be lifted into the water using [[lift bag]]s.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; The sculptures are created with [[pH]]-neutral marine concrete, made with the help of marine park officials and the Cancún Nautical Association, and are created above ground and cleaned before being taken underwater so they do not have any chemicals on them that may harm the water, animals, or reef.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

Jason deCaires Taylor’s ''The Silent Evolution'' consists of more than 400 human figures depicted interacting with the environment around them, with both a positive and negative impact. He shows how humans can live with nature and make a workable future between the two, but also how humans have damaged nature, specifically the coral reefs, and show no sympathy.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/outposts/2010/11/jason-decaires-taylor-artificial-reef-silent-evolution-underwater-sculptures.html "Artist Completes Artificial Reef, ‘The Silent Evolution,’ Installing 400 Sculptures Underwater"]. LA Times Blogs - Outposts, November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statues in ''The Silent Evolution'' show how some humans see their surrounding and embrace them while others hide their faces. Each statue was made to resemble members of a local fishing community where Taylor lives. Each statue has its own personality and features. Taylor made sure every detail from the hair to the clothes of the statues was perfect. They include a little girl with a faint smile on her face looking up to the surface; six businessmen with their heads in the sand, not paying attention to their surroundings; and even a man behind a desk with his dog lying him, but looking tired and uninvolved in the environment. The work took Taylor 18 months and 120 hours of working underwater and used 120 tons of concrete, sand, and gravel, 3,800m of fiberglass, and 400kg of silicone.&lt;ref name=LA/&gt; 

Taylor planted pieces of coral from damaged reefs on some of the first sculptures.&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;Garling, Caleb. [https://www.wired.com/2011/04/underwater-sculpture/ "Underwater Sculptures Give Sea Creatures a Haunting New Habitat"]. Wired, April 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Silent Evolution'' is a two-part art installation: the underwater sculptures themselves are the first part, while the second is how nature will transform them as coral grows and a new reef forms.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jason deCaires. "Swimming with Sculptures". New Scientist 212, no. 2843 (December 17, 2011): 48–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 a new installation by Taylor, ''What Have We Done?'', opened at Punta Nizuc.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

One exhibit room is on shore in a mall, Plaza Kukulcán, with 26 replicas and one original ceramic sculpture by Roberto Díaz Abraham, ''The Ocean Muse''.

==Benefits==
The underwater museum is to benefit the protection of the coral reefs. Artificial reefs are usually created by sunken ships and other objects that have fallen to the bottom of the ocean floor. The statues are a new technique and material for coral to grow on, a means for art to save the oceans.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;Geiling, Natasha. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/underwater-museum-180951559/ "Can Underwater Art Save the Ocean’s Coral Reefs?"] Smithsonian, June 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As the statues were made with pH-neutral cement, coral, seaweed, and algae are able to grow and develop better than on an old ship.  Stable structures with a stable base are known to be ideal surfaces for artificial reefs. The statues also have holes in them, which allow marine wildlife to colonize and feed off the coral. Coral reefs will increase, but so will marine life.  After only a short time under the water, the statues began to be transformed by nature. In time, all the statues will be covered and their figures will barely be visible&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;
  
The museum also benefits the community by attracting tourists.&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt; One local guide expressed concern to a reporter that the statues will themselves be damaged, but the museum is planned to grow and to repair itself.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt;

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

=== Eastern church ===
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|250px|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], 586 CE]]
Early depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution.&lt;ref name=Dreyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kevin Seasoltz ,''A Sense Of The Sacred: Theological Foundations Of Christian Architecture And Art'', 2005, Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|church in Ireland]], important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where [[Saint Patrick]], returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7yFjie05bcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+of+saint+columba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEvvnbkZLNAhUE44MKHQECA3oQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick&amp;f=false Life of St Columba], Penguin books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

[[File:Stacja IX Jezus upada po raz trzeci.jpg|thumb|''Jesus Falls the Third Time'', a photographic performance by [[Łukasz Jankowski-Wojtczak]], 2011]]
Crucifixion has appeared repeatedly as a theme in many forms of [[modern art]].

The [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] painted ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', representing the cross as a [[hypercube]]. Fiona Macdonald describes the 1954 painting as showing a classical pose of Christ superimposed on a mathematical representation of the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] that is both unseeable and spiritual;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160511-the-painter-who-entered-the-fourth-dimension|title=The painter who entered the fourth dimension|first=Fiona|last=Macdonald|publisher=BBC Culture|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Bolyer assesses it as "one of the most beautiful works of the modern era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://garybolyer.com/2013/01/21/review-crucifixion-corpus-hypercubus-by-salvador-dali/|title=Review of Crucifixion Corpus Hypercubus by Salvador Dali|first=Gary|last=Bolyer|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture ''Construction (Crucifixion): Homage to Mondrian'', by [[Barbara Hepworth]], stands on the grounds of [[Winchester Cathedral]]. [[Porfirio DiDonna]]'s abstract ''Crucifixion'' is one of a number of religious works he painted in the 1960s, "blending the artist's devotion to the [[liturgy]] and his commitment to painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=John |title=Porfirio DiDonna: The Shape of Knowing |location=Brooklyn, NY |publisher=Pressed Wafer |year=2013 | page=36 |isbn=978-1-940396-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Welsh Window", given to the [[16th Street Baptist Church]] after it was bombed by four [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen in 1963, is a work of support and solidarity.

Other artists have used crucifixion imagery as a form of protest. In 1974, [[Chris Burden]] had himself crucified to a [[Volkswagen]]. Robert Cenedella painted a crucified Santa Claus as a protest against Christmas commercialization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcenedellagallery.com/slideshow.php?theme=Commentary&amp;i=5 RCenedella Gallery Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715160144/http://www.rcenedellagallery.com/slideshow.php?theme=Commentary&amp;i=5 |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; displayed in the window of New York's Art Students League in December 1997.

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

== Passion plays ==
[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Czech Symphony Orchestra''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Český symfonický orchestr'', short: ČSO) is a classical orchestra based in [[Prague]].

As an ensemble put together for various international recording and concert projects, it has been active since 1994. The orchestra was composed of musicians with recording as well as concert experience and has worked with conductors like [[Erwin Gutawa]]. Currently under the leadership of [[Oskar Rózsa]] the orchestra's latest projects involved film music recordings for internationally successful Czech movies like [[Lidice (film)|Lidice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://czechsymphonyorchestra.com/en/orchestr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''exhaustion of intellectual property rights''' constitutes one of the limits of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets is governed by the principle.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/export/international_exhaustion.htm|title=International Exhaustion and Parallel Importation|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a [[patent]] right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This limitation is also referred to as the '''exhaustion doctrine''' or '''first sale doctrine'''.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but can not prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. There is a "fairly broad consensus" throughout the world "that this applies at least within the context of the domestic market".&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "national exhaustion". However, "[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "regional exhaustion" or "international exhaustion". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of international exhaustion in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' for US copyright law, and in that decision explained the general rationale for the doctrine under [[common law]] principles of property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 TRIPS: "For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">'''Sir George Reeves-Smith''' (17 July 1863 – 29 May 1941) was an English hotelier. Hired by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] in 1900 to replace [[César Ritz]] as manager of the [[Savoy Hotel]], he remained in the post until his death four decades later. In addition to running the Savoy, he was general manager of the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group and was a director of the [[Savoy Theatre]].  He was also instrumental in establishing charitable medical institutions in England and Switzerland.

==Early years==
Reeves-Smith was born in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of George Reeves-Smith, whose jobs included running the [[Brighton]] aquarium.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Jaine, Tom. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37887 "Smith, Sir George Reeves- (1863–1941)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Brighton College]] and then apprenticed to J. Calvet ''et cie'', [[Bordeaux]] wine ''[[négociant]]s'', after which he trained in the hotel industry.  By 1893 he was manager of the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley Hotel]], [[Piccadilly]], and four years later he led a [[management buy-out]], with himself as principal shareholder and managing director.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the same time, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], founder of the Savoy Hotel, dismissed his manager, [[César Ritz]], for financial irregularities, and was looking for a suitable replacement.  Carte was impressed by both Reeves-Smith and the Berkeley, and he effectively secured both by purchasing the Berkeley and making Reeves-Smith managing director of the Savoy hotel group.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Reeves-Smith held this office from 1900 for the rest of his life, and from 1916 took on the post of vice-chairman of the company, which he also held for life.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U230887 "Reeves-Smith, Sir George"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, in addition to managing the growing Savoy hotel group, which included, among other interests, the Savoy, the Berkeley, [[Claridge's]] and [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]], he became a director of the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Savoy group==
The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' said of Reeves-Smith that "he was aware of the slightest derogation from high standards of housekeeping or service; yet he was innovative and capable of masterly delegation ... punctilious and conservative in manner and dress, he had a shrewd business appreciation of practical detail and people's tastes in leisure activities."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1930, the novelist [[Arnold Bennett]], who knew the Savoy well, dedicated his ''Imperial Palace'' to Reeves-Smith. The principal character of the novel, Evelyn Orcham, is the resourceful and urbane general manager of a large ''hôtel de luxe'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Arnold. [http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/etexts/E000279.htm ''Imperial Palace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013723/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/etexts/E000279.htm |date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves-Smith founded the Hotels and Restaurants Association (1910) and was its dominant figure for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 30 May 1941, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  He was connected with other catering industry organisations, including the International Hotel Alliance, of which he was president.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;  His interests extended beyond the world of grand hotels: he was instrumental in founding in the Preston Hall centre for tuberculous ex-servicemen in [[Kent]], and the British Sanatorium in [[Montana-Vermala]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was knighted in 1938 for service to the hotel industry, and was honoured by France (''[[Légion d'honneur]]'', 1938) and Italy (Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], 1939).&lt;ref name=who/&gt; In 1938 Reeves-Smith engaged as his assistant [[Hugh Wontner]], who took over when Reeves-Smith died.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', obituary of Hugh Wontner, 27 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1888 Reeves-Smith married Maud Hindle, daughter of a Brighton hotelier. They had one son, who was killed in [[World War I]], and one daughter.  Their home was always a suite in one of Reeves-Smith's hotels, first in the Berkeley, then at Claridge's, where Reeves-Smith died of pneumonia, aged 77, survived by his wife.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary gives his age as 86, but does not cite date of birth, and the dates and age given in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' have been used above.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kamen Rider Ryuki'''''|仮面ライダー龍騎|Kamen Raidā Ryūki|''Masked Rider Ryuki''}} is a Japanese [[tokusatsu]] television series. The twelfth installment in the [[Kamen Rider Series]] of tokusatsu shows, it was a joint collaboration between [[Ishimori Productions]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]], and it was shown on [[TV Asahi]] from February 3, 2002 to January 19, 2003. The series marked the franchise's switch from [[Nippon Columbia|Columbia Music Entertainment]] to [[Avex Group]], which continues to produce music for the Kamen Rider Series today.

In 2009, ''Ryuki'' was adapted into the American television series ''[[Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight]]'', the first adaptation of a Kamen Rider Series in the United States since ''[[Masked Rider (TV series)|Saban's Masked Rider]]'' in 1996.

==Story==
{{Main|List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters}}
{{nihongo|Thirteen Card Decks|カードデッキ|Kādo Dekki}} were created for thirteen Kamen Riders. They make Contracts with monsters from the mysterious {{nihongo|Mirror World|ミラーワールド|Mirā Wārudo}}, a parallel dimension opposite to our own in which only the Kamen Riders can exist. The Riders draw on their monsters' strength in exchange for feeding them the life force of the creatures they destroy. The creator of the {{nihongo|Advent Cards|アドベントカード|Adobento Kādo}} has only one rule: that there can be only one Kamen Rider. The others must be killed, and the sole victor will be granted a single wish, which leads to a conflict known as the Rider War.

All over the city, innocent people are being mysteriously abducted, never to be seen again. During his investigations of these incidents, Shinji Kido – an intern at the online news service ORE Journal – discovers one of the Advent Card decks at an apartment where every reflective surface has been covered by newspaper. He is soon sucked into the Mirror World, discovering the terrifying truth behind the disappearances: people are literally being pulled through mirrors by the monsters of the Mirror World so that they may feed. He is about to be killed by a powerful dragon named Dragredder when he is saved by [[Kamen Rider Knight]]: Ren Akiyama. Ren seeks to win the Rider War at all costs. He works with a young woman named Yui Kanzaki, who seeks her missing brother: the master of the Rider War, Shiro Kanzaki. Seeing Ren's strength, Shinji enters the Rider War not for the prize, but so that he may protect innocent people from the threat of the Mirror World, and stop the senseless fighting between the Kamen Riders. With Dragredder as his Contract Monster, he becomes [[Kamen Rider Ryuki (character)|Kamen Rider Ryuki]].

He will discover that there are some people who cannot be saved. That you must sometimes fight in order to stop the fighting. The extent to which you must go if you want your deepest wish to come true, and the sacrifices that you must make. In the end, there can be only one Kamen Rider.

==Movies and specials==

===''13 Riders''===
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki Special: 13 Riders''|仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル 13RIDERS|Kamen Raidā Ryūki Supesharu Sātīn Raidāzu}} was written by [[Toshiki Inoue]] and directed by [[Ryuta Tasaki]]. It features the debut of the thirteenth Kamen Rider in the continuity of ''Ryuki'': [[Kamen Rider Verde|Verde]]. This special was first broadcast on [[TV Asahi]] on September 19, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toei-video.co.jp/data/hs/vcatalog_dvd/item/200307/dstd02180.html|title=仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル　［13RIDERS］|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=239972|title=TVM 仮面ライダー龍騎　スペシャル［13RIDERS］ - allcinema|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released on DVD on July 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://movie.news.livedoor.com/dvd/detail-2203060008.html |title=仮面ライダー龍騎スペシャル 13 RIDERS - 映画 - livedoor ニュース |accessdate=2010-09-13 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD also featured information on the characters, an interview with actor [[Arthur Kuroda]], and an "interview" with some of the characters.

This television special is an alternate telling of the ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'' story. Shinji Kido's life, working as an employee at ORE Journal, takes a sharp turn after being pulled into the Mirror World by a Mispider. Luckily, he was saved by a Kamen Rider, Ryuki (Koichi Sakakibara, portrayed by [[Keiichi Wada]]). However, Sakakibara could no longer go on due to the severity of his injuries and passed his Card Deck to Shinji, allowing him to become the next Ryuki and defeat the monster. After meeting with Yui Kanzaki and Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider Knight), Shinji learns about the conditions of the Rider War, as well as of the other Riders participating. Unable to allow such a game of death to exist like his Rider predecessor, Shinji sets out to convince all the Riders to end the senseless fighting and put an end to the War. His pleas fall upon deaf ears as just about every other Rider (except for the already-defeated Riders Raia and Scissors) sets out to hunt down Shinji and his eventual reluctant ally, Ren. Eventually, Shinji's deck is destroyed and Ren dies, after passing on the deck for Kamen Rider Knight to Shinji. The special has two different endings which were voted on by the viewers via phone at the time of the initial airing: the voted-for-air ending (in which Shinji faces the surviving Riders on his own) and the alternate ending (a resetting of the Rider War).

===''Episode Final''===
{{Main|Kamen Rider Ryuki: Episode Final}}
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki the Movie: Episode Final''|劇場版 仮面ライダー龍騎 EPISODE FINAL|Gekijōban Kamen Raidā Ryūki Episōdo Fainaru}} is an alternate ending to the series, taking place after the events of episode 46. With only six Riders remaining in the Rider War; Ryuki (Shinji Kido), Knight (Ren Akiyama), Zolda (Shuichi Kitaoka), Ouja (Takeshi Asakura), and Femme (Miho Kirishima); Shiro Kanzaki alerts them to quickly settle the Rider War within three days. One of them must win and become the last survivor before the sixth surviving Rider reveals himself. Amidst the impending chaos of the fight between the Riders, Shinji discovers an unbelievable truth about the relationship between Yui Kanzaki and the Mirror World, as well as discovering the existence of his Mirror World doppelganger, Kamen Rider Ryuga.

===''Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito''===
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Ryuki: Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito''|仮面ライダー龍騎 龍騎vs仮面ライダーアギト|Kamen Raidā Ryūki Ryūki Bui Esu Kamen Raidā Agito}} is the ''Ryuki'' Hyper Battle Video. It features Shinji Kido having a dream where he joins up with Kamen Riders Knight, Zolda, and Ouja, all of whom who are acting out of character, to fight an evil Kamen Rider Agito in the Mirror World. They are soon joined by the real Kamen Rider Agito who helps defeat his evil doppelganger.

===''Ultra Super Hero Taisen''===
{{main article|Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen}}
A crossover film, titled {{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen''|仮面ライダー×スーパー戦隊 超スーパーヒーロー大戦|Kamen Raidā × Supā Sentai Chō Supā Hīrō Taisen}} featuring the casts of ''[[Kamen Rider Ex-Aid]]'', ''[[Amazon Riders]]'', ''[[Uchu Sentai Kyuranger]]'' and ''[[Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger]]'', was released in Japan on March 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-26/kamen-rider-x-super-sentai-cho-superhero-taisen-film-announced-for-march-25-premiere/.110365 |title=Kamen Rider x Super Sentai: Chō Superhero Taisen Film Announced for March 25 Premiere - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2016-12-26 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie will celebrate 10th anniversary of ''[[Kamen Rider Den-O]]'' who also appear in this movie. It also features the spaceship Andor Genesis from the ''[[Xevious]]'' game, which serves to be used by the movie's main antagonists, as well as introducing the movie-exclusive Kamen Rider True Brave played by Kamen Rider Brave's actor [[Toshiki Seto]] from ''Kamen Rider Ex-Aid'', and villain Shocker Great Leader III played by the singer [[Diamond Yukai]]. In addition, individual actors from older Kamen Rider and Super Sentai TV series, [[Ryohei Odai]] (''Kamen Rider Ryuki''), [[Gaku Matsumoto]] (''[[Shuriken Sentai Ninninger]]''), [[Atsushi Maruyama]] (''[[Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger]]''), and [[Hiroya Matsumoto]] (''[[Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters]]'') reprise their respective roles.

==S.I.C. Hero Saga==
''Ryuki'' had two separate [[Super Imaginative Chogokin|S.I.C.]] Hero Saga side stories published in ''Monthly Hobby Japan'' magazine. The first was titled {{nihongo4|''Masked Rider Ryuki: Advent Calendar''|MASKED RIDER RYUKI -アドベントカレンダー-|Kamen Raidā Ryūki -Adobento Karendā-}} and featured original characters {{nihongo4|[[Kamen Rider Ouja]] Survive|仮面ライダー王蛇サバイブ|Kamen Raidā Ōja Sabaibu}} and his Mirror Monster the {{nihongo4|Genosurviver|ジェノサバイバー|Jenosabaibā}}. The second S.I.C. Hero Saga story {{nihongo4|''Masked Rider Ryuki: World of If''|MASKED RIDER RYUKI -IFの世界-|Kamen Raidā Ryūki -Ifu no Sekai-}} is an alternate telling that features Ouja Survive from ''Advent Calendar'' and also introduces {{nihongo4|[[Kamen Rider Ryuga]] Survive|仮面ライダーリュウガサバイブ|Kamen Raidā Ryūga Sabaibu}}. ''Advent Calendar'' ran from August to December 2004 and ''World of If'' ran from June to August 2005.

==International broadcasts==
In addition to the ''Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight'' adaptation, ''Ryuki'' has been broadcast in its original form in many languages and nations. It was dubbed into [[Korean language|Korean]] as ''Masked Rider Dragon'' ({{lang|ko|가면라이더 드래건}} ''Gamyeon Raideo Deuraegeon'') in [[South Korea]] on January 14, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masked-rider.co.kr/dragon/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425060528/http://www.masked-rider.co.kr/dragon/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-04-25 |title=가면라이더 드래건 |accessdate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filipino language|Filipino]] in the Philippines as ''Masked Rider Ryuki'' on [[ABS-CBN]] 2, [[Malay language|Malay]] on [[NTV7]], and in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] on [[RCTI]] and [[Indosiar]]. It is also the first ever Kamen Rider Series to be dubbed in Arabic after its run on [[Space Toon]].

The trust promotes the arts in prisons, secure hospitals, immigration centres and in the community, encouraging creativity and the acquisition of new skills as a means to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. It was founded in 1962, by a [[bequest]] from the British-Hungarian author, [[Arthur Koestler]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Koestler Trust|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/history.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Koestler's prison experience==

Koestler had been detained in three jails in separate countries. In Spain, he was sentenced to death in 1936 for espionage under [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Koestler 1905-1983|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/arthurkoestler.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he witnessed many executions, and was held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Menand|first=Louis|title=Road Warrior: Arthur Koestler and his century|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/12/21/091221crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=1|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in France a few years later and held in the [[Le Vernet Internment Camp]] for subversion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Koestler was released and fled to England, where he was held at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]] as a suspected illegal immigrant.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Creation of the Koestler Trust==
His experiences in prison led him to write ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and newspaper articles campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He also attempted to change the experience of incarceration, stating  that in prison, "the main problem is apathy, depression and gradual [[dehumanisation]]. The spark dies."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chesshyre|first=Robert|title=The Fine Art of Starting Over|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/17/art|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler spoke of being intellectually under-stimulated&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and terrorized in prison,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and wanted to provide "an imaginative and exciting way to stimulate as far as possible and in as many cases as possible the mind and spirit of the prisoner."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1962, Koestler arranged the Arthur Koestler Award (now Koestler Trust) through the [[Home Office]] of the United Kingdom, to award monetary prizes for artistic achievement to prisoners, detainees, and psychiatric patients.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==The Koestler Trust Today==
Today the Koestler Awards cover over 61 artforms, across music, writing, crafts, design, performance and fine art. Each category is judged by panels of experts, including Grayson Perry, Jeremy Deller, V&amp;A, National Theatre, Speech Debelle and Hot Chip (2014 UK Awards). An annual exhibition programme is curated separately and held at Southbank Centre. Recent curators of the UK exhibition include Grayson Perry, Sarah Lucas, Speech Debelle, Victims of Crime, Magistrates, women prisoners and ex-prisoners. The charity also holds locally-focused exhibitions - recent shows include Snail Porridge at Castlefield Gallery in Manchester (2014) curated by Bob and Roberta Smith,  and Release at Glasgow's Tramway, curated by Kibble Secure Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/awards.html|title=Koestler Trust Awards|work=koestlertrust.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trust also runs mentoring programmes for people who wish to continue in the arts after release from prison or other secure settings.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/exhibitions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107135901/http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/exhibitions.html |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artforms|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/awardsartform.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes were initially paid by Koestler himself, but the award was reorganized into a charitable trust in 1969, as more sources of funding became necessary.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Today, artwork by the prisoners and others is available for sale direct to the public through the trust's exhibitions. Artists receive 50% of proceeds, 25% goes to Victim Support and 25% to the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/buyart.html|title=Koestler Trust Art for sale|work=koestlertrust.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Sales|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/buyart.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finite spherical symmetry groups are also called [[point groups in three dimensions]]. There are five fundamental symmetry classes which have triangular fundamental domains: [[Dihedral symmetry|dihedral]], [[Cyclic symmetry|cyclic]], [[tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[octahedral symmetry|octahedral]], and [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] symmetry.

This article lists the groups by [[Schoenflies notation]], [[Coxeter notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[orbifold notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and order. [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] uses a variation of the Schoenflies notation, based on the groups' [[quaternion]] algebraic structure, labeled by one or two upper case letters, and whole number subscripts. The group order is defined as the subscript, unless the order is doubled for symbols with a plus or minus, "±", prefix, which implies a [[central inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann–Mauguin notation]] (International notation) is also given. The [[crystallography]] groups, 32 in total, are a subset with element orders 2, 3, 4 and 6.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involutional symmetry ==

There are four [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]al groups: no symmetry (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[reflection symmetry]] (C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;), 2-fold rotational symmetry (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and central [[point symmetry]] (C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Polyhedral symmetry ==
{{See|Polyhedral groups}}
There are three types of [[polyhedral symmetry]]: [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [[octahedral symmetry]], and [[icosahedral symmetry]], named after the triangle-faced [[regular polyhedra]] with these symmetries.

'''''Men of the Docks''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas completed by the American artist [[George Bellows]] in 1912. Depicting the docks of [[New York City]], this {{convert|114.3|by|161.3|cm|adj=on}} painting was sold to the [[National Gallery]] in London in 2014 for $25.5 million.

==Description==
''Men of the Docks'' is a  {{convert|114.3|by|161.3|cm|adj=on}} [[oil painting]] on canvas.&lt;ref name="NatGat1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Key Facts |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks/*/key-facts |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA9lE7F9?url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks/*/key-facts |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |publisher=National Gallery, London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a group of men, wearing overcoats smeared in grime, standing at a dock in [[Brooklyn]] together with some [[draft horse]]s. These men appear to be [[day labor]]ers, at the docks to find work. They look to the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner looms over them to their right. Behind them are a [[tugboat]] and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower [[Manhattan]] skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray.&lt;ref name="NatGal2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks |title=George Bellows, Men of the Docks |publisher=National Gallery |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAA1GjiJ?url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-bellows-men-of-the-docks |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Craftsman"/&gt;

A writer for ''[[The Craftsman (magazine)|The Craftsman]]'' considered ''Men of the Docks'' to be "free of affectation of soul or technique", presenting a situation of solidity the way a normal man would see it, thus holding onto the scene through reality.&lt;ref name="Craftsman"/&gt; However, the art critics Robert W. Snyder and Rebecca Zurier consider the painting to leave viewers in suspense as to the exact nature of the message received by this group of men, whether it is news that no work is available or notice that the men can begin their labor. This tension, they write, paired with the juxtaposition of the skyline and harbor (almost hidden from land), emphasizes the precariousness of the laborers' situation.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;

==Completion==
[[File:George bellows.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], {{circa}} 1900]]
The artist, [[George Bellows]], arrived in New York City in 1904.&lt;ref name="NatGal2"/&gt; He completed ''Men of the Docks'' in 1912.&lt;ref name="NatGat1"/&gt; At the time the [[Ashcan School]], a group of painters who focused on the daily life in New York, was prominent. Bellows, and ''Men of the Docks'', has been considered part of this [[art movement|movement]].&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt;

In the early 20th century, day laborers in the New York docks worked depending on the availability of ships to unload, and thus when not working they often stood nearby, waiting for news that there was work.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book |title=Metropolitan Lives: The Ashcan Artists and Their New York |last1=Snyder |first1=Robert W. |first2=Rebecca  |last2=Zurier |chapter=Picturing the City |pages=97–98 |isbn=978-0-937311-27-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaEWfZr3A1EC |publisher=National Museum of American Art |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject of men at the New York docks was a common one for Bellows, as well as fellow Ashcan painters such as [[Everett Shinn]]. ''Men of the Docks'' is the largest example of Bellows' treatment of the subject.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

==Provenance==
''Men of the Docks'' was exhibited at the Vanderbilt Gallery of the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1912,&lt;ref name="Meltzer"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The World To-day: A Monthly Record of Human Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvQzAQAAMAAJ|volume=21 |date=May 1912 |title=Art at our National Academy |last=Meltzer |first=Charles Henry |pages=2291–94 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Cornell Alumni News |issue=32 |title=Exhibition of Paintings |volume=15 |page=380 |year=May 1913 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaxDAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellows again exhibited the work at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915, winning a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia |issn=0195-8798 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceFKAAAAYAAJ |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1920 |editor1=Lindsay Rogers |editor2=James S. Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was purchased for the [[Maier Museum of Art]] at [[Randolph Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], in 1920; at the time, the college was one of the foremost for women intent on studying art. At the recommendation of Professor [[Louise Jordan Smith]], students and locals raised $2,500 to purchase the work. Beginning with this painting, the Maier collection eventually grew to include 3,500 works.&lt;ref name="Conant"/&gt;

After the 1980s, Randolph College faced decreasing enrollment and financial difficulties. As such, in 2007 it decided to sell four of its works&amp;nbsp;– including ''Men of the Docks''. All of these works were taken from the Maier Museum in late 2007. Bellows' painting was scheduled to be auctioned at [[Christie's]] in New York, and expected to sell for $25–35 million. This would have been a record for an American painting sold at auction.&lt;ref name="Franham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/218.html |last=Franham |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA5F17v9?url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/218.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |first=Alan |work=Forbes |title=Ashcan on Fire |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=November 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this prospective sale faced controversy at the college. Students made "Missing" posters overlaid showing photocopies of ''Men of the Docks'' and the three other paintings which were to be sold.&lt;ref name="Conant"&gt;{{cite web|last=Conant |first=Eve |date=October 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/42498 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA5ZAPR0?url=http://www.newsweek.com/shot-through-art-103439 |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |title=A Shot Through the Art |work=[[Newsweek]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit against the sale continued over the next several years, with detractors including the Association of Academic Museums and Galleries, the [[College Art Association]], and the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]]. As the art market deflated, a Virginia judge blocked the sale in November 2007, but in March 2008 opponents of the sale had to drop their suit as they were unable to post the $1&amp;nbsp;million bond required of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2008/03/10/maier/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VA6XgcAi?url=http://entertainment.time.com/2008/03/10/maier/ |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Look Out Bellows – Looking Around |date=March 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the painting was lent to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., to be included in a comprehensive exhibition of Bellow's career.

Ultimately, ''Men of the Docks'' was bought by the [[National Gallery]] in London in February 2014 for a total of $25.5&amp;nbsp;million (£15.6&amp;nbsp;million). The money was acquired from a fund established by [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty]]. Director [[Nicholas Penny]], said that the painting was a new direction for the gallery, as a non-European painting in a European style.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; The museum also touted a “new, transatlantic academic partnership, the first of its kind between an American college and a UK gallery” established by the sale, in which curators could lecture at Randolph and students of the college could do their internships at the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/national-gallery-spends-255m-on-george-bellows-men-of-the-docks--its-first-major-american-painting-9113161.html |work=The Independent |title=National Gallery spends $25.5m on George Bellows' Men of the Docks&amp;nbsp;– its first major American painting |last=Clark |first=Nick |date=February 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAC3U9kb?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/national-gallery-spends-255m-on-george-bellows-men-of-the-docks--its-first-major-american-painting-9113161.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Bellows Painting Moves From Virginia to London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205502/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/design/a-bellows-painting-moves-from-virginia-to-london.html?_r=0 |archivedate=March 30, 2014 |last=Vogel |first=Carol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=February 6, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/design/a-bellows-painting-moves-from-virginia-to-london.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the sale, the College Art Association stated that Randolph had "compromised the educational and cultural mission of the museum" by  selling art to increase its coffers, rather than to purchase further art.&lt;ref name="Controversy"/&gt; In protest, both the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and [[Tacoma Art Museum]] cancelled plans to borrow a [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] work.&lt;ref name="N&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news|work=The News &amp; Advance |last=Pounds |first=Jessie |title=Ten months after 'Men of the Docks' sale, Randolph College says benefits outweigh costs |date=December 25, 2014 |url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/ten-months-after-men-of-the-docks-sale-randolph-college/article_b10b8f78-8c9b-11e4-960a-07e13a333891.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAFpPchN?url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/ten-months-after-men-of-the-docks-sale-randolph-college/article_b10b8f78-8c9b-11e4-960a-07e13a333891.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; College president Bradley W. Bateman defended the sale by saying that the college was "a college, not a museum", and thus not bound to follow guidelines established for museums. He further argued that Randolph's priority was to ensure quality education for its students, and that the $25.5 million for the painting was a "considerable" addition to the college's [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of  $136&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Controversy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Randolph sale of art to National Gallery sparks criticism |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/randolph-sale-of-art-to-national-gallery-sparks-criticism/2011309.article |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228182227/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/randolph-sale-of-art-to-national-gallery-sparks-criticism/2011309.article |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=February 12, 2014 |last=Jaschik |first=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the sale, Randolph had already sold another of its works, [[Rufino Tamayo]]'s ''Troubador''.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;

''Men of the Docks'' was the first major American painting acquired by the gallery, and the second painting by Bellows to be publicly owned in Europe.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/07/national-gallery-acquire-george-bellows |title=National Gallery to acquire George Bellows' Men of the Docks for $25.5m |work=The Guardian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAAfP4b7?url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/07/national-gallery-acquire-george-bellows |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |date=February 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After its acquisition, ''Men of the Docks'' was hung in Room 43 of the National Gallery, between works by such European artists as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Camille Pissarro]].&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; The painting, with the [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]] of NG6649, hangs in Room 45 {{as of|December 2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="NatGat1"/&gt;

==Reception==
Critic Charles Henry Meltzer, reviewing after the National Academy exhibition, described ''Men of the Docks'' as "irritating ... yet full of talent" owing to its "deliberate carelessness" in the drawing of the crowd, which he found to have character.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; The writer for ''The Craftsman'' found the painting to be "an important painting of the year", "a freshly painted canvas&amp;nbsp;... presented with the thrill and wonder inherent in the edges of great seaport towns".&lt;ref name="Craftsman"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Craftsman |pages=129–30 |title=The Spring Academy: Its Tendencies and Successes| volume=22 |issue=2 |date=May 1912 |oclc=1565375 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yY1AAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Porter of Christie's described ''Men of the Docks'' as "the definitive essay on the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century. It’s big, brawny, tough."&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt; Alan Franham of ''[[Forbes]]'' called it "a class by itself", noting that, as opposed to the work's value of millions of dollars, prints by the artist could be bought for $50,000.&lt;ref name="Franham"/&gt; The curator Christopher Riopelle considers the painting to "evoke something of the raw and unbeautiful energy of the urban experience in what was at the time one of the world's fastest-growing cities" through its "wilful awkwardness and brutality".&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt;

'''Michael Strank''' (November 10, 1919 &amp;ndash; March 1, 1945) was an [[Americans|American]] soldier, [[United States Marine Corps]] [[sergeant]] who was killed in action during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]]. He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second  [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

The [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.

== Early life ==
Michael Strank was born in [[Jarabina]], [[Czecho-Slovakia|Czechoslovakia]] (now in [[Slovakia]]). His two brothers, Peter and John, and his sister Mary were born in the United States to Vasil Strank (later, in the U.S., known as Charles Strank) and Marta Grófiková, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-[[Lemko]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upns.org/article/86-two-jima-ukrainian-connection The Ukrainian Weekly Vol. 68 No. 23 (4 June 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yes1111.dreamwidth.org/1247090.html|title=yes1111 {{!}} EN: Glory to the heroes! Michael 'Mykhal' Strank|website=yes1111.dreamwidth.org|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memory.gov.ua/sites/default/files/userupload/broshura-eng-sait.pdf Ukraine in World War II. — Kyiv, Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance, 2015. — 28 p., ill.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vasil Strank moved to [[Franklin borough, Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Borough]] (near [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], United States), found work in the coal mines for the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]], and brought his family to [[Pennsylvania]] three years later, when he could pay for their voyage. Strank attended the public schools of Franklin Borough and graduated from [[Franklin Borough School District|Franklin Borough High School]] in 1937. He joined the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], served for 18 months, and afterwards became a Pennsylvania state highway laborer.

== U.S. Marine Corps ==
Strank enlisted in the Marine Corps at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] for four years service on October 6, 1939. He was assigned to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[South Carolina]]. He completed recruit training in December and was transferred to Headquarters Company, Post Troop and then to Provisional Company W at Parris Island, on January 17, 1941. Private First Class Strank sailed for [[Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving on January 23, 1941. He was reassigned to Headquarters Company, [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]], 1st Marine Brigade (on February 1, the 1st Marine Brigade was redesignated the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]). On April 8, now assigned to Company K, he returned to the United States and was sent back to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. He was promoted to [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] on April 23, 1941. In September, Strank moved with the 1st Marine Division to [[Marine Corps Air Station New River|New River, North Carolina]], which is where he was stationed when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred.

=== World War II ===
On January 26, 1942, Strank was promoted to [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]]. In early April, he was sent with the [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] to [[San Diego, California]] and shipped out of there on April 12. On May 31, 1942, his battalion landed on the island of [[Wallis Island|Uvea]]. In September, after a short time with the [[22nd Marine Regiment (United States)|22nd Marine Regiment]], he was transferred to the [[Marine Raiders|3rd Marine Raider Battalion]] also on Uvea. As a member of the "3rd Raiders", he participated in the landing operations and occupation of [[Pavuvu]] in the [[Russell Islands]] from February 21 to March 18, 1943 and in the seizure and occupation of the [[Empress Augusta Bay]] during the [[Bougainville campaign (1944-45)|Battle of Bougainville]] from November 1 to January 12, 1944. On February 14, 1944, when his and the other Marine Raider units were in the process of being disbanded, he was sent to San Diego and allowed a leave to visit his family.

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====
Strank returned to duty in San Diego and was assigned to Second Platoon, Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]], as a squad leader. He was sent to [[Hawaii]] with his unit after extensive training, and began more training and preparation for the invasion of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].

===== First flag-raising =====
[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]
Strank took part in the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi on February 19, 1945. The 28th Marines mission was to capture Mount Suribachi. At 8 AM on the morning of February 23, E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], led a 40-man patrol whose members were mostly from Third Platoon, E Company, up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. Once the top was secure by Lt. Schrier and his men, the Second Battalion's [[Flag of the United States|flag]] Schrier carried was attached to a steel Japanese water pipe by Lt. Schrier, Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]], and Cpl. [[Charles W. Lindberg|Charles Lindberg]]. The flag was taken to the highest position on the crater and raised and planted by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]], and Sgt. Hansen at about 10:30 AM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html Rural Florida Living. CBS interview by Dan Pryor with flag-raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas] on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Second flag-raising =====

[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|'''Strank''' is included in a portion of the color film shot of the second flag raising by Sgt. [[Bill Genaust]], USMC, excerpted from the 1945 "Carriers Hit Tokyo" newsreel.]]

In order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land on the north side of Mount Suribachi (where more Japanese soldiers were located and more fighting would occur in the days ahead), it was decided that another larger flag should be flown on Mt. Suribachi. Strank was ordered by E Company's commander to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon and raise the replacement flag. Strank then ordered Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up Mount Suribachi with supplies. Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]], the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.

Once Strank's team was on top (after Gagnon), Hayes and Sousley found a Japanese pipe to attach the flag to. Once done, the flagstaff was placed close to first flag's position and, under Lt. Schrier's orders, the replacement flag was raised at approximately 1 p.m. by Strank, Hayes, Sousley, and Block (Sgt. Hansen was incorrectly identified as being at the base of the flagstaff -- where Block was -- until January 1947), Gagnon (Strank called for Gagnon and another Marine to help), and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]], a member of the 40-man patrol who was also present at the first flag-raising (the Marine Corps announced on June 23, 2016, that Schultz raised the second flag and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] did not),&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the original flag came down. In order to keep the flagstaff in a vertical position in the high winds on the summit, rocks were immediately added to the base of the flagstaff by Gagnon, Schultz and others nearby. A rope was then tied to the flagstaff which was staked to the ground in three places (Bradley assisted the Marines using the rope).

The six Marine flag-raisers were photographed in mid-action by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] and by Marine motion picture cameraman Sergeant [[Bill Genaust|William (Bill) Genaust]] (later killed in action) in color. After the second flag-raising, Rosenthal photographed sixteen Marines including Strank and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff. Rosenthal's black and white flag-raising picture which appeared in newspapers on Sunday, February 25, 1945, was later titled [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]. It became the most copied photograph in history or at least in Marine Corps history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|title=Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle|first=Mitchell|last=Landsberg|year=1995|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905115709/http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|archivedate=September 5, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late March 1945, Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Sousley, were killed in action (Platoon Sgt. [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]] and Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] of the first flag-raising were also killed).

==== Death and burial ====
On February 28, Strank and E Company moved northward. Fighting was heavy, and both the Japanese and the American forces were taking heavy casualties. On March 1, Strank's rifle squad came under heavy fire and took cover. While forming a plan of attack, he was killed by [[Friendly fire|friendly artillery fire]]. The shell that killed him was almost certainly fired from offshore by an American ship. Cpl. Harlon Block, Strank's assistant squad leader, took command of the squad. Block was killed later on the same day by a Japanese mortar shell. However, Ralph Griffiths of Second Platoon, Easy Company, claimed that Strank and Block were on both sides of him on March 1 and were killed by the same shell that also wounded him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://taishawalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/iwo-jima-survivor-recalls-the-bloody-war/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://listen.sdpb.org/post/marine-veterans-recall-iwo-jima#stream/0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/14/veteran-of-easy-company-recalls-rigors-of-iwo-jima/?print]&lt;/ref&gt; Strank and the other Marines killed in action of the 28th Regiment were buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on the island with the last rites of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Strank (and possibly Block) was the first person in the Rosenthal's flag raising photograph to be killed. On January 13, 1949, his remains were reinterred in Grave 7179, Section 12, [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Strank's brother Peter Strank, was serving aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|''USS Franklin'']] in the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]] when Michael Strank was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33148-2005Feb17.html] Wahingtonpost.com, February 18, 2005, ''The Shadow of Suribachi'', by Timothy Dwyer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumbnail|A photo showing positions and names of all six Marine flag-rasiers. Left to right: Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Schultz, '''Sgt. Strank''', Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Gagnon, and Cpl. Block]]
Strank was born on November 10, the Marine Corps birthday. The members of Sgt. Mike Strank's rifle squad idolized him (Cpl. Harlon Block for one followed his every instruction without question), and many men since who served with and alongside him have stated he had a way of setting them at ease, making them feel that ''he'' could help them survive the war. Of the men photographed raising the second flag on Iwo Jima, Strank at age 25, was the oldest and most experienced in combat.

In interviews of former Marines conducted years later, many documented in the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' written by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of corpsman John Bradley), he is described by men who served with him as "a Marine's Marine", a true warrior and leader, who led his men by example. Strank often told his men, "Follow me, and I'll try to bring you all safely home to your mothers." One former Marine who served with Strank stated, "He was the kind of Marine you read about, the kind they make movies about." L.B. Holly, who served in Strank's squad and who was with Strank when he died, stated, "He was the best Marine I ever knew."

== U.S. citizenship ==
In 2008, Gunnery Sergeant Matt Blais, who was a Marine security guard in the American Embassy in Slovakia, discovered that Strank was not a natural-born U.S. citizen.  Strank had become a U.S. citizen after his father's naturalization in 1935, but had never received official documentation.&lt;ref name=MCNews_Carfrey_20080730&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|title=Iwo Jima flag raiser posthumously receives citizenship certificate|first=Bryan G.|last=Carfrey|work=Official U.S. Marine Corps Web Site|date=July 30, 2008|accessdate=November 1, 2008|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813092941/http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|archivedate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GySgt. Blais petitioned the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] on Strank's behalf and on July 29, 2008, Strank's youngest sister, Mary Pero, was presented with his certificate of citizenship in a ceremony at the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]].&lt;ref name="MCNews_Carfrey_20080730"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCT_Bush_20080730&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=Joe|title=Citizenship granted to Iwo Jima flag raiser|work=Marine Corps Times|date=July 30, 2008|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2008/07/marine_iwojimacitizenship_072908w/|accessdate=July 31, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210045310/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2008/07/marine_iwojimacitizenship_072908w/|archivedate=February 10, 2009|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Basta col cianuro
# Preludio per un massacro estivo

# Spara che ti passa
# Stazione centrale ammazzare subito
# Minorenne da bruciare
# Conoscerei scopo matrimonio
# Una signorina senza rivoltella
# Non si vive di solo poker
# Piccolo Hotel per sadici
# Quando una donna piace forte
# Bravi ragazzi bang bang
# Strangolare ma non troppo
# Ubbidire o morire
# Vietato essere felici
# A Porta Venezia con paura
# Come è fatto un mostro?
# La giustizia quasi arriva ad Arzavò
# Il nodo Luisa
# La vendetta è il miglior perdono
# Ricordati Cuore Infranto

A '''poster''' is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface.&lt;ref&gt;[Gosling, Peter. (1999). Scientist's Guide to Poster Presentations. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46076-0}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically posters include both [[typography|textual]] and [[graphic]] elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes.  They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians, and films), [[propaganda|propagandists]], [[protest]]ors, and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eskilson, Graphic Design: A New History, Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 049.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"Moulin Rouge - La Goulue" &lt;br /&gt;[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], 1891&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Introduction===
According to the French historian [[Max Gallo]], "for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service."&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;Gallo, Max, ''The Poster in History'', (2002) W.W. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century,  when several separate but related changes took place. First, the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Guffey, Posters: A Global History, Reaktion: 2015, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In little more than a hundred years", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, "it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Mucha]] to theatrical and commercial designers."&lt;ref name=Barnicoat&gt;Barnicoat, John, ''Posters: A Concise History'', (1985) Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  They have ranged in styles from [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Art Deco]] to the more formal [[Bauhaus]] and the often incoherent [[hippie]] posters of the 1960s.

===Mass production===
Posters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries.  However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique [[lithography]] which was invented in 1796 by the German [[Alois Senefelder]]. The invention of lithography was soon followed by [[chromolithography]], which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.

===Developing art form===
By the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe.  A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Louis Anguetin]], [[Alfred Choubrac]], [[Georges de Feure]] and [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern poster by Arsène Alexandre&lt;/ref&gt; Chéret is considered to be the "father" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.

[[Chéret]] developed a new [[lithographic]] technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative [[typography]], rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Chéret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], Chéret's laughing and provocative feminine figures, often called "chérettes," meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.

Posters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris, making the streets into what one contemporary called "the poor man’s picture gallery."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Marx, Masters of the Poster, 1896–1900 (New York, 1977), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial success was such that some fine artists took up poster design in earnest.  Some of these artists were, like Alphonse Mucha, in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.

===Golden age of the poster===

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the [[Belle Époque]], the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Chéret created the [[Maîtres de l'Affiche]] (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success but is now seen as an important historical publication. [[Alphonse Mucha]] and [[Eugène Grasset]] were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their [[Art Nouveau]] style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. [[Poster artist]]s such as [[Théophile Steinlen]], [[Albert Guillaume]], [[Leonetto Cappiello]], [[Henri Thiriet]] and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.. Indeed, as design historian Elizabeth Guffey notes, “As large, colorful posters began to command the spaces of public streets, markets, and squares, the format itself took on a civic respectability never afforded to Victorian handbills.”&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], posters underwent a slightly different evolution.  By the 1850s,  the advent of the traveling circus brought colorful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. While many of these posters were beautifully printed, the earliest were mass-produced woodcuts; that technique, as well as their subject matter, crowded style, and bright colors, was often derided by contemporary critics.   As chromo-lithography began to reshape European posters, American artists began to take the medium more seriously.  Indeed, with work of designers like [[Edward Penfield]], or [[Will Bradley]] gained an audience in Europe as well as America.

==Decline and resurgence==
Challenged by newer modes of advertising, the poster as a communicative form began to decline after the First World War.  Civic groups had long assailed the poster, arguing that the form made public spaces ugly.  But the real threat to posters came from newer forms of advertising.  Mass-market magazines, radio and later television, and bill-boards all cut into advertiser’s marketing budgets. While posters continued to be made and advertised products, they were no longer considered a primary form of advertising.  More and more, posters purpose shifted toward political and decorative uses.

Indeed, by the mid 1960s, posters were reborn as part of a broader counter-cultural shift. By 1968 the poster craze was described as "half way between a passing fashion and a form of mass hysteria." &lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, Posters of Protest: The Posters of Political Satire in the U.S., 1966–1970 (New York, 1971), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sometimes called a “second golden age” or "postermania"&lt;ref&gt;Hilton Kramer, ‘Postermania’, New York Times Magazine (11 February 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; however, this resurgence of popularity saw posters used as decoration and self-expression as much as public protest or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. Many posters have had great [[artistic merit]].  These include the posters advertising consumer products and entertainment, but also events like the [[World's Fair]]s and [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[Art exhibitions|Exhibitions]].

===Political uses===
[[File:In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg|thumb|right|A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States, "[[In God We Trust]]," in a [[New Philadelphia High School]] classroom.|200px]]
Other times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The first widespread use of illustrated posters for political ends occurred during the First World War.  War bond drives and recruitment posters soon replaced commercial advertisements. German graphic designers, who had pioneered the simple Sachplakat style in the years leading up to the war, applied their talents to the war effort. Artists working for the Allied cause also made over their art in wartime, as well.

The 1960s saw the rise of [[pop art]] and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters and contributed to the poster's revitalization at this time.
Perhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by [[France|French]] students during the so-called "''événements''" of May 1968. During the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]] and for years to come, [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick's]] stylized poster of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (based on the photo ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], in the United States, public schools across the country posted "[[In God We Trust]]" framed posters in their "libraries, cafeterias and classrooms." The [[American Family Association]] supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/02/20/usat-posters.htm |title='In God We Trust' pressed for schools - USA Today |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster printing==
Many [[printing]] techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.

It is possible to use [[Tiled printing|poster creation software]] to print large posters on standard home or office printers.

==Types of poster designs==
Many posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising [[film]]s, [[music]] (both concerts and recorded albums), [[comic book]]s, and [[tourism|travel]] destinations being particularly notable examples.

===Propaganda and political posters===
[[File:German propaganda poster, Upper Silesia Plebiscite 1.jpg|thumb|[[German propaganda]] poster, 1921]]

During the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]" posters from the [[United Kingdom]], the "[[Uncle Sam]] wants you" posters from the United States, or the "[[Loose lips sink ships|Loose Lips Sink Ships]]" posters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022072541/http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html |date=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/warposters/english/introduction.htm |title='Canadian War Poster Collection' |publisher=Digital.library.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posters during wartime were also used for [[propaganda]] purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous [[Rosie the Riveter]] posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The [[Soviet Union]] also produced a plethora of [[World War II posters from Soviet Union|propaganda posters]],&lt;ref name="spam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://posters.nce.buttobi.net |title=Propaganda posters - Collection of 1400+ POSTERS from Russia, Czech republic, Poland and Cuba |publisher=Posters.nce.buttobi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which became iconic representations of the [[Great Patriotic War]].
During the democratic [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the [[Berlin Wall]], on the statue of St. Wenseslas in [[Prague]] and around the unmarked grave of [[Imre Nagy]] in [[Budapest]] and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Barack Obama "HOPE" poster]].

===Movie posters===

{{Main article|Film poster}}
The [[film]] industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4438948.stm |title=Lang film poster fetches record |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] realizing $452,000 in a 1997 [[Sotheby's]] auction,&lt;ref name=metropolis /&gt; and posters from both [[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]] and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] selling for $334,600 in various [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://movieposters.ha.com/common/search_results.php?ic=homepage_search&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=54+790+231&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;BIRD GEI Consultoria Idiomas. "http://birdgei.com/2012/02/07/film-posters/"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel posters===
Poster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the [[Beach Town Posters]] series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

====Railway posters====
In the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905,  the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) commissioned [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland.  In 1908, for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR),  [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] produced the famous image of the "Jolly Fisherman" with the "Skegness is so Bracing" slogan.  The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/Posters.aspx |title=Railway posters - Our collection - National Railway Museum |publisher=Nrm.org.uk |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event posters===

[[Image:Replacing an advertising poster in London using an articulated platform 02.JPG|thumb|right|Replacing an advertising poster in London using an aerial work platform.]]
Posters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.

====Boxing posters====
Boxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a [[collectible]].

====Concert posters====
Many [[concert]]s, particularly [[rock concert]]s, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.

===Band/music posters===
Posters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in [[teenager]]s' bedrooms, as well as in [[college]] [[dorm room]]s and [[apartment]]s. Many posters have pictures of popular [[rock band]]s and artists.

====Blacklight poster====
{{Main article|Blacklight poster}}
Blacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a [[blacklight]] (ultraviolet light).

===Pin-up posters===
Pinup posters, "pinups," or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy [[pin-up girl]] posters has been erratic in recent decades.  Pin-ups such as [[Betty Grable]] and [[Jane Russell]] were highly popular with soldiers during [[World War II]] but much less so during the [[Vietnam War]]. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially [[Farrah Fawcett]] and  [[Cheryl Tiegs]].

===Affirmation posters===
[[File:Goals affirmation poster, Navy · DF-SD-04-09850.JPEG|thumb|An example of an [[Affirmation posters|affirmation poster]]]]
{{Main article|Affirmation posters}}
This refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as "Leadership" or "Opportunity." Another version (usually [[picture frame|framed]] and matted) uses a two-image [[hologram]] which changes as the viewer walks past.

===Publications===

====Comic book posters====
The resurgence of [[comic book]] popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward.  These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses.  The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster.  Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors.  Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.

===Educational posters===

====Research posters and "poster sessions"====
{{Main article|Poster session}}
Posters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. Poster presentations are often not [[peer-review]]ed,{{Contradict-inline|article=Poster session|reason=Text in the article on Poster Sessions says that the work usually HAS been peer-reviewed.|date=March 2018}} but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.

====Classroom posters====
Posters are a standard feature of [[classrooms]] worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: advertising tie-ins (e.g. an historical movie relevant to a current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions (such as lab safety and proper hand washing) ; artwork and displays by the students.

As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103" /&gt;

==History==
Although the term "domain" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept "can be traced back to the ancient [[Roman law|Roman Law]], as a preset system included in the property right system."&lt;ref name="Haung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=H.|title=On public domain in copyright law| journal=Frontiers of Law in China| year=2009| volume=4| issue=2| pages=178–195| doi=10.1007/s11463-009-0011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned"&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; as ''[[res nullius]]'', ''[[Res communis|res communes]]'', ''[[Res publica|res publicae]]'' and ''res universitatis''. The term ''res nullius'' was defined as things not yet appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, C Romans, Roads, and Romantic Creators: Traditions of Public Property in the Information Age (Winter 2003) Law and Contemporary Problems 89 at p.5, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''res communes'' was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean."&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; The term ''res publicae'' referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term ''res universitatis'' meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of ''res communes'', ''res publicae'', and ''res universitatis'' in early Roman law.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt;

When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of "public domain", they used terms such as ''[[publici juris]]'' or ''propriété publique'' to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 134–135| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of [[copyright term]]. The French poet [[Alfred de Vigny]] equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of  public domain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 154| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as [[copyright]], [[patents]], and, expire or are abandoned.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=103 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 137| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar [[Pamela Samuelson]] has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=102 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] own copy of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', with hand-written corrections for the second edition]]

Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=104 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]] this definition underlines common usage of the term ''public domain'' and equates the public domain to [[public property]] and works in copyright to [[private property]]. However, the usage of the term ''public domain'' can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by [[copyright exceptions]]. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to [[fair use|fair-use]] rights and limitation on ownership.&lt;ref name="Boyle 2008 38"/&gt; A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"/&gt; Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=105 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"/&gt;

==Public domain by medium==
{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}

=== Public domain books ===
A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn1Pl9Gv_EMC&amp;dq=public%20domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind|first=James|last=Boyle|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have been forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;dq=%22public%20domain%22%20intellectual%20property&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions in a Digital Environment|first1=Christoph Beat|last1=Graber|first2=Mira Burri|last2=Nenova|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most countries the [[List of countries' copyright lengths|term of protection]] of copyright lasts until January first, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.

A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale written prior to 1923 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books written between 1923 and 1978.

For example: the works of [[Jane Austen]], [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over one hundred years ago.

[[Project Gutenberg]] makes tens of thousands of public domain books available online as [[ebook]]s.

===Public domain music===
{{Main article|Public domain music}}
People have been creating music for millennia. The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducability have lead to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.

U.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2049-2067, depending on the date and location of publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain |title= Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate= October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Musopen]] project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service.

===Public domain films===
{{Main article|Public domain film}}
A '''public-domain film''' is a [[film]] that was released to public domain by its author or because its [[copyright]] has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2,000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Value==
Pamela Samuelson has identified eight "values" that can arise from information and works in the public domain.&lt;ref name="Guibault 2006 xx"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Guibault |first= Lucy |author2= Bernt Hugenholtz |title= The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year= 2006 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-9-0411-24357 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141218080732/http://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate= 18 December 2014 |df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section called "Public Domain Works That Are Modified".&lt;/ref&gt;

Once works enter into the public domain, derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably, as happened with [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', which became public domain in 1987.&lt;ref name="Lundin2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lundin |first=Anne H. |title= Constructing the canon of children's literature: beyond library walls and ivory towers |url= https://books.google.com/?id=72flittye58C&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=1 June 2010 |date=2 August 2004 |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-0-8153-3841-3 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, the plays of Shakespeare, all public domain, had been used in more than 420 feature-length films.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Mark (ed.).

==Perpetual copyright==
{{Main article|Perpetual copyright}}
Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual [[crown copyright]] is held for the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce M. |last=Metzger |title=The Oxford companion to the Bible|year=2006 |publisher= Oxford Univ. Press |location= Oxford |isbn=978-0-1950-46458 |pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by [[J. M. Barrie]] (the play ''[[Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''  and the novel ''Peter and Wendy'') in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48) |work=Office of Public Sector Information |year=1988 |page=28 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601225021/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.

In a [[paying public domain]] regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=24 November 2010 |publisher=Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore: Seventeenth Session

== Public domain mark ==
{{Main article|Public Domain Mark}}
[[File:Cc-public_domain_mark_white.svg |thumb |150px|[[Creative Commons]]' [[Public Domain Mark]]]]
The [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] proposed in 2010 the ''[[Public Domain Mark]]'' (PDM) as [[symbol]] to indicate that a work is free of known [[copyright]] restrictions and therefore in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |title= Creative Commons announces the Public Domain Mark |publisher=[[The H]] |work=The H Open |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=12 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016044229/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |archivedate= 16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |title= Improving Access to the Public Domain: the Public Domain Mark |publisher= Creative Commons |author=Diane Peters |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=11 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014022853/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |archivedate= 14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public domain mark is analogous to the [[copyright symbol]], which acts as [[copyright notice]]. The [[Europeana]] databases use it, and for instance on the [[Wikimedia Commons]] in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as ''PDM''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-PD-Mark Category:CC-PD-Mark ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312115401/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3ACC-PD-Mark |date=12 March 2016 }} in February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to copyrightable works==

===Works not covered by copyright law===
The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see [[idea–expression divide]]). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.

Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.

===Expiry of copyright===
Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.

In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.

In most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)

Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities |formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Karjala]], "Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation", 35 N. Ky. L. Rev. 253 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government works===
[[Work of the United States Government|Works of the United States Government]] and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Copyright Office Basics] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225235545/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that "it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work".&lt;ref&gt;[[Melville Nimmer |Nimmer, Melville B.]], and David Nimmer (1997). ''[[Nimmer on Copyright]]'', section 13.03(F)(4). Albany: Matthew Bender.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedicating works to the public domain===

==== Release without copyright notice ====
Before 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit [[Copyright notice]]. With the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a [[waiver]] statement/[[anti-copyright notice|anti-copyright can call notice]].&lt;ref name="cornelledu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher= |accessdate= 30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926203654/http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copyrightgov"&gt;''[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf Copyright Notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926110554/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |date=26 September 2012 }}'', U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]".&lt;ref name="aboutcc0"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |title= About CC0 — "No Rights Reserved" |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate= 23 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130428010038/http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |archivedate= 28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public-domain-like licenses ====
{{main article|Public domain equivalent license}}
An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission ("[[Permission culture]]"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as a public domain like [[software license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130602181949/http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&amp;view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Creative commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |title= 11/17: Lulan Artisans Textile Competition |date=17 June 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080413/https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |archivedate=31 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unlicense]], published around 2010, has a focus on an [[Anti-copyright]] message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324154539/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |date=24 March 2016 }} on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unlicense.org The Unlicense] on unlicense.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] recommends the Creative Commons [[CC0]] license to dedicate content to the public domain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)'' for data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/ pddl] on opendatacommons.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
{{Main article|Term of patent}}
In most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c).&lt;ref&gt;Manual of Patent Examining Procedure available at {{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150418103411/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |archivedate= 18 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''text'' and any ''illustration'' within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |title= Terms of Use for USPTO Websites |first= Office of the Chief Communications |last=Officer |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090925103511/http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |archivedate= 25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is separate from the ''patent'' rights just mentioned.

==Trademarks==
A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.

Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug "acetylsalicylic acid" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, "Aspirin", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm Aspirin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824141625/http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm |date=24 August 2005 }}, World of Molecules&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for "Heroin" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Although [[Hormel]] resigned itself to genericide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013192409/http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-date=13 October 2009 |title=SPAM® Brand and the Internet |publisher= Hormel Foods}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has fought attempts by other companies to register "[[spam (food)|spam]]" as a [[trademark]] [[spamming|in relation to computer products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |title=Hormel Spam trademark case canned |author=Kieren McCarthy |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080707001848/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |archivedate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Domain Day ==
{{main article|Public Domain Day}}
[[File:Logo PDD 2016.svg |thumb|An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland]]

Public Domain Day is an observance of when [[copyright]]s expire and works enter into the public domain.&lt;ref name="telcouk"&gt;{{cite web |last= Richmond |first=Shane |url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100004467/happy-public-domain-day-heres-to-many-more/ |title=Happy Public Domain Day!

'''Rosalind Epstein Krauss''' (born November 30, 1941) is an American [[art critic]], [[art theory|art theorist]] and a professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/html/dept_faculty_krauss.html Columbia Faculty directory]&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss is known for her scholarship in 20th-century [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]]. As a critic and theorist she has published steadily since 1965 in ''[[Artforum]],'' ''[[Art International]]'' and ''[[Art in America]]''. She was associate editor of ''Artforum'' from 1971 to 1974 and has been editor of ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', a journal of contemporary arts criticism and theory that she co-founded in 1976.

==Early life==
Krauss was born to Matthew M. Epstein and Bertha Luber &lt;ref name="theartstory.org"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm] Rosalind E. Krauss biography&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington D.C. and grew up in the area, visiting art museums with her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]] in 1962, she attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]],&lt;ref name="artcritical.com"&gt;[http://www.artcritical.com/2013/08/30/rosalind-krauss-interview/] The Real Thing: An Interview with Rosalind E. Krauss by David Plante at: http://www.artcritical.com/&lt;/ref&gt; whose Department of Fine Arts (now Department of History of Art and Architecture) had a strong tradition of the intensive analysis of actual art objects under the aegis of the [[Fogg Art Museum|Fogg Museum]].

Krauss wrote her dissertation on the work of [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]].&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss received her Ph.D. in 1969. The dissertation was published as ''Terminal Iron Works'' in 1971.&lt;ref name="artcritical.com"/&gt;

In the late-1960s and early-1970s Krauss began to contribute articles to art journals such as ''Art International'' and ''[[Artforum]]'' — which, under the editorship of Philip Leider, was relocated from California to New York.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt; She began by writing the "Boston Letter" for ''Art International,'' but soon published well-received articles on [[Jasper Johns]] (''Lugano Review'', 1965) and [[Donald Judd]] (''Allusion and Illusion in [[Donald Judd]],'' ''[[Artforum]]'', May 1966). Her commitment to the emerging [[minimal art]] in particular set her apart from [[Michael Fried]], who was oriented toward the continuation of modernist abstraction in [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]] and [[Anthony Caro]]. Krauss's article ''A View of [[Modernism]]'' (''[[Artforum]]'', September 1972), was one signal of this break.

==Career==
===Founding ''October''===
Krauss became dissatisfied with ''Artforum'' when in its November 1974 issue it published a full-page advertisement by featuring the artist [[Lynda Benglis]] aggressively posed with a large latex [[dildo]] and wearing only a pair of [[sunglasses]] promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]].&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Challenging Art: Artforum 1962–1974 |last = Cohen |first=David |journal = The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |issue=3 |date=September 2002 |pages=535–538|doi=10.2307/3177317|last2=Newman|first2=Amy |jstor=3177317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doss"&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century American Art |series=Oxford History of Art |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |location = [[Oxford]] |year= 2002 |last = Doss |first =Erika |isbn =0-19-284239-0 |pages=184 |chapter = Feminist Art and Black Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Benglis' image is now popularly cited as an important example of gender performativity in contemporary art, it provoked mixed responses when it first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Susan. "{{cite web|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/nparadoxavolumes.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829124953/http://www.ktpress.co.uk/nparadoxavolumes.htm |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}" "Sizing Up the Dildo: Lynda Benglis' ''Artforum'' Advertisement as a Feminist Icon", ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' 15 (January 2005): 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis' work in the following month's issue of ''Artforum'', describing the advertisement as exploitative and brutalizing, and soon left the magazine to co-found ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt;

''October'' was formed as a politically-charged journal that introduced American readers to the ideas of French [[post-structuralism]], made popular by [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="theartstory.org"/&gt; Krauss used ''October'' as a way of publishing essays on post-structuralist art theory, [[Deconstruction]]ist theory, [[psychoanalysis]], [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="theartstory.org"/&gt;

The founders included Krauss, Annette Michelson and the artist [[Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe]]. Krauss was appointed as its founding editor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, [[Douglas Crimp]] joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], Denis Hollier, and John Rajchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trikster.net/2/crimp/1.html |title=Mathias Danbolt, Front Room – Back Room: An Interview with Douglas Crimp |work=Trikster – Nordic Queer Journal #2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===

====Hunter College====
Krauss taught at [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] before joining the faculty at [[Hunter College]] in 1974. She was promoted to professor in 1977 at Hunter and was also appointed professor at the Graduate Center of [[City University of New York|CUNY]]. She held the title of Distinguished Professor at Hunter until she left to join the [[Columbia University]] faculty in 1992. In 1985, a monograph of essays by Krauss, titled ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths'' was published by [[The MIT Press]].

====Columbia University====
Previously [[Meyer Schapiro]] Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia, in 2005 Rosalind Krauss was promoted to the highest faculty rank of [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]]. She has received fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and has been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts and of the Institute for Advanced Study. She received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for criticism from the [[College Art Association]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]] since 1992 and was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1994. She recently received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of London]].

===Curator===
Krauss has been curator of many art exhibitions at leading museums, among them exhibitions on [[Joan Miró]] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] (1970–73), on [[surrealism]] and photography at the [[Corcoran Museum of Art]] (1982–85), on [[Richard Serra]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (1985–86), and on [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] at the Guggenheim (1992–94). She prepared an exhibition for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris called "Formlessness: Modernism Against the Grain" in 1996.

==Critical approach==

===Greenbergian tradition===
Krauss's attempts to understand the phenomenon of modernist art, in its historical, theoretical, and formal dimensions, have led her in various directions. She has, for example, been interested in the development of photography, whose history – running parallel to that of modernist painting and sculpture – makes visible certain previously overlooked phenomena in the "high arts", such as the role of the indexical mark, or the function of the archive. She has also investigated certain concepts, such as "formlessness", "the optical unconscious", or "pastiche", which organize modernist practice in relation to different explanatory grids from those of progressive modernism, or the avant-garde.

Like many, Krauss had been drawn to the criticism of [[Clement Greenberg]], as a counterweight to the highly subjective, poetic approach of [[Harold Rosenberg]]. The poet-critic model proved long-lasting in the New York scene, with products from [[Frank O'Hara]] to Kynaston McShine to [[Peter Schjeldahl]], but for Krauss and others, its basis in subjective expression was fatally unable to account for how a particular artwork's objective structure gives rise to its associated subjective effects.

Greenberg's way of assessing how an art object works, or how it is put together, became for Krauss a fruitful resource;&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=The Medium Inquisitor|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=21 October 1993|volume=40|issue=17|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/oct/21/the-medium-inquisitor/|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if she and fellow "Greenberger", [[Michael Fried]], would break first with the older critic, and then with each other, at particular moments of judgment, the commitment to [[formal analysis]] as the necessary if not sufficient ground of serious criticism would still remain for both of them. Decades after her first engagement with Greenberg, Krauss still used his ideas about an artwork's 'medium' as a jumping-off point for her strongest effort to come to terms with post-1980 art in the person of [[William Kentridge]]. Krauss would formulate this formalist commitment in strong terms, against attempts to account for powerful artworks in terms of residual ideas about an artist's individual genius, for instance in the essays "The Originality of the Avant-Garde: A [[Postmodernist]] Repetition" and "Photography's Discursive Spaces." For Krauss, and for the school of critics who developed under her influence, the Greenbergian legacy offers at its best a way of accounting for works of art using public and hence verifiable criteria.

===Translating ephemeralities into prose===
Whether about ([[Cubist]] [[collage]], [[Surrealist]] photography, early [[Giacometti]] sculpture, [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]) or about art contemporaneous to her own writing ([[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Cindy Sherman]]), Krauss translates the ephemeralities of visual and bodily experience into precise, vivid English, which has solidified her prestige as a critic. Her usual practice is to make this experience intelligible by using categories translated from the work of a thinker outside the study of art, such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Georges Bataille]], or [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, she participated in the translation of Lacan's key text "[[Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment|Television]]" which was published in October and later reissued in book form by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]]. Her work has helped establish the position of these writers within the study of art, even at the cost of provoking anxiety about threats to the discipline's autonomy. She is currently preparing a second volume of collected essays as a sequel to ''The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths'' (1986).

In many cases, Krauss is credited as a leader in bringing these concepts to bear on the study of modern art. For instance, her ''Passages in Modern Sculpture'' (1977) makes important use of [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s phenomenology (as she had come to understand it in thinking about minimal art) for viewing modern sculpture in general. In her study of Surrealist photography, she rejected [[William Rubin]]'s efforts at formal categorization as insufficient, instead advocating the psychoanalytic categories of "dream" and "automatism", as well as [[Derrida|Jacques Derrida]]'s "grammatological" idea of "spacing." See "The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism" (''October'', winter 1981).

===Picasso's collages===
Concerning Cubist art, she took Picasso's collage breakthrough to be explicable in terms of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s ideas about the differential relations and non-referentiality of language, rejecting efforts by other scholars to tie the pasted newspaper clippings to social history. Similarly, she held Picasso's stylistic developments in Cubist portraiture to be products of theoretical problems internal to art, rather than outcomes of the artist's love life. Later, she explained Picasso's participation in the ''rappel à l'ordre'' or [[return to order]] of the 1920s in similar [[structuralism|structuralist]] terms. See "In the Name of Picasso" (''October'', spring 1981), "The Motivation of the Sign" (in Lynn Zelevansky, ed., ''Picasso and Braque: A Symposium'', 1992), and ''The Picasso Papers'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998).

===Freudian theory===
From the 1980s, she became increasingly concerned with using a [[psychoanalytic]] understanding of drives and the unconscious, owing less to the Freudianism of an [[André Breton]] or a [[Salvador Dalí]], and much more to the structuralist [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] and the "dissident surrealist" [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt; See "No More Play", her 1984 essay on [[Giacometti]], as well as "Corpus Delicti", written for the 1985 exhibition ''L'Amour Fou: Photography and Surrealism'', ''Cindy Sherman: 1975–1993'' and ''The Optical Unconscious'' (both 1993) and ''Formless: A User's Guide'' with Yve-Alain Bois, catalog to the exhibition ''L'Informe: Mode d'emploi'' (Paris: Centre Pompidou, 1996).

===Interpreting Pollock===
Years after her time at ''[[Artforum]]'' in the 1960s, Krauss also returned to the drip painting of [[Jackson Pollock]] as both a culmination of modernist work within the format of the "easel picture", and a breakthrough that opened the way for several important developments in later art, from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s happenings to [[Richard Serra]]'s lead-flinging process art to [[Andy Warhol]]'s oxidation (i.e. urination) paintings. For reference, see the Pollock chapter in ''The Optical Unconscious,'' several entries in the ''Formless'' catalog, and "Beyond the Easel Picture", her contribution to the [[MoMA]] symposium accompanying the 1998 Pollock retrospective (''Jackson Pollock: New Approaches''). This direction provided intellectual validation for the explosive Pollock markets; but it exacerbated already tense relations between herself and more radical currents in visual/cultural studies, the latter growing steadily impatient with the traditional western art-historical canon.

In addition to writing focused studies about individual artists, Krauss also produced broader, synthetic studies that helped gather together and define the limits of particular fields of practice. Examples of this include "Sense and Sensibility: Reflections on Post '60s Sculpture" (''Artforum'', Nov. 1973), "Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism" (''October'', spring 1976), "Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America", in two parts, ''October'' spring and fall 1977), "Grids, You Say", In ''Grids: Format and Image in 20th Century Art'' (exh. cat.: Pace Gallery, 1978), and "Sculpture in the Expanded Field" (''October'', spring 1979). Some of these essays are collected in her book ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths''.

'''''SMart''''' was a British [[CBBC]] television programme based on the subject of [[art]], which began in 1994 and ended in 2009. The programme was recorded at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, previously it had been recorded in Studio A at [[Pebble Mill Studios|BBC Pebble Mill]] in Birmingham. The format is similar to the [[Tony Hart]] programmes ''[[Take Hart]]'' and ''[[Hartbeat]]''. The show was revamped into an hour-long show in 2007; from 1994-2006 it was previously a 25-minute show. From 1994–2005, the show also featured [[Morph (character)|Morph]], originally from ''Take Hart''. It has 199 episodes. CBBC last aired ''SMart'' on 11 August 2011.

==Production==
The original theme tune was composed by [[Kjartan Poskitt]], famous for the ''[[Murderous Maths]]'' series of books.  From 2003, a different tune was used, written by [[Steve Brown (composer)|Steve Brown]] (known as the fictional musical director [[Glen Ponder]] in ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]''). In 2007, this was remixed by Matt Thomas of Mosquito Music in line with the new format.

In 2007, the new autumn series had a new format mixing some of the old segments with new ideas. It was aired on Sunday, and repeated on Wednesdays. It involved more child participation in games and celebrity guests. This new format also allowed for episodes of ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' to be aired halfway in. One of the segments displayed art that had been sent in by viewers, to the backing music of 'Give It Away' by [[Zero 7]].

The format was utilised again when a new series began with a new timeslot on Sunday 29 June 2008, airing on CBBC on BBC Two, still presented by [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mike Fischetti]]. A special tribute to [[Mark Speight]] was also broadcast. Along with this new format, guest presenters appear each week to assist the two presenters.

Following the death of presenter [[Mark Speight]]'s fiancee [[Natasha Collins]] in January 2008, repeats of the show and its [[CBeebies]] spin-off ''[[SMarteenies]]'' were suspended.  Speight left the programme, saying his "tragic loss" had left him unable to continue; he later committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7410338.stm | title= Presenter Speight hanged himself | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=20 May 2008 | accessdate=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC indicated that there would still be a new series of ''SMart'' in the autumn, but editions featuring Speight are unlikely to be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7350087.stm|title=TV presenter left suicide notes|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=16 April 2008|accessdate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series 16 began airing on 3 January 2009 in the same style to the series before. The major change was that the original airings moved to the [[CBBC Channel]] rather than [[BBC Two]]. [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mike Fischetti]] both returned to host the show and the show continued to have guest presenters. The games involving children in the studio were dropped and instead children participated via [[webcam]] or pre-recorded on location. The show also added segments on fun aspects of digital photography.

==Spin-offs==
The success of ''SMart'' allowed it to spawn various spin-off series.  The first was ''SMart on the Road'' where either [[Mark Speight]] or [[Kirsten O'Brien]], with the help of Lizi Botham, would travel around the country helping people with major projects, for example decorating a room or making a fun garden.  It starred [[Kirsten O'Brien]], [[Mark Speight]], [[Jay Burridge]] and Lizi Botham.

''[[SMarteenies]]'' was the second spin-off, where Kirsten, Mark, Jay and "Bizi Lizi" went through fun makes for younger viewers, including ''man of letters and shapes'' and Kirsten's Household Makes with Doogie the Dog. This programme was specifically aimed at a younger demographic, roughly from 3–6 years old on was aired on [[CBeebies]].  It starred [[Kirsten O'Brien]], [[Mark Speight]], [[Jay Burridge]] and Lizi Botham.

A special episode, ''SMart Africa'', was made by the BBC to coincide with Africa Week. The episode contained easy ways to make things. This episode, with [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mark Speight]], was aired as part of the 2003 series.

==Legacy==
In March 2011, CBBC started to air ''Deadly Art'' which followed a very similar format to ''SMart'' and also stars [[Mike Fischetti]]. They look to the wild for inspiration (to tie in with the "Deadly" series e.g. ''Deadly 60''). Then CBBC aired ''Totally Rubbish'' and their current art series is ''[[Art Ninja]]'', whose presenter Ricky Martin said he watched ''SMart'' religiously as a child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creativebloq.com/art-direction/aardman-designer-encourages-kids-get-creative-art-tv-show-21514202&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Decorative Painters''' ('''SDP''') was formed in 1972 to promote interest in decorative painting. Decorative painting includes all styles of painting including [[Tole painting]] or [[Rosemaling]]. The organization is a "not-for-profit" organization but it does not have tax exempt status.

In 2008, the Society was responsible for finding an artist to paint Christmas ornaments for use in the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Breckenridge|first=Mary Beth|title=Macedonia artist paints White House ornament|url=http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/macedonia-artist-paints-white-house-ornament-1.119537|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal|date=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, SDP members helped produce holiday decorations for use in the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holidays at Renwick|url=http://eyelevel.si.edu/2009/12/the-holidays-at-the-renwick.html|work=Eye Level|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=26 January 2012|date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist certification==
The Society of Decorative Painters offers a certification program for either Certified Decorative Artists (CDA) or Master Decorative Artists (MDA). Artists can be certified in still life, floral or stroke categories. Once a year Master Decorative Artists review anonymous portfolios before selecting an artist for either CDA or MDA certification. The process requires an application, entry fee, and one project submitted for the portfolio.

==Code of Ethics==
The society has a code of ethics members agree to follow. The ethics include following copyright laws, creating a friendly atmosphere, cooperation between individuals, groups and the like; honesty, fairness and adhering to the organization's code of ethics.

{{nihongo|'''''Tankōbon'''''|単行本||"independent/standalone book"}} is the Japanese term for a book that is complete in itself and is not part of a series or corpus. In modern Japan, though, it is most often used in reference to individual volumes of a single [[manga]], as opposed to {{Nihongo|[[Manga magazines|magazines]]|雑誌|zasshi}}, which feature multiple series.&lt;ref name = "Gravett"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gravett|title=Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VgdjrS-lYwQC|publisher=Harper Design|year=2004|ISBN=1-85669-391-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schodt 1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederik L. Schodt|title=' Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ1AAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Manga!+Manga! |publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|year=1986|ISBN=978-0-87011-752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] labels for manga tankōbon publications include Jump Comics (for manga originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' and other [[Jump (magazine line)|''Jump'' magazines]]), [[Shōnen Sunday|Shōnen Sunday Comics]], and [[Weekly Shōnen Magazine|Shōnen Magazine Comics]].

==Japanese comics==
[[Image:Tankobon comparison.jpg|thumb|This ''tankōbon'' (here, ''[[Love Hina]]'' #11) is smaller than this English ''tankōbon'' (here, ''[[Genshiken]]'' #8).]]
Typically, [[manga|Japanese comics]] are first published in thick, [[phone book|phone-book]]-sized weekly or monthly anthology [[list of manga magazines|manga magazine]]s (such as ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'', ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', or ''[[Hana to Yume]]''). These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors. They are printed on very cheap [[newsprint]] and are considered disposable. A ''tankōbon'' collects multiple installments from a single series and reprints them in a roughly [[paperback]]-sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing. However, any colored images from the magazine publication are typically [[grayscale]]d.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

In [[English language| English]], while a ''tankōbon'' translation is usually marketed as a "[[graphic novel]]" or "[[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]", the transliterated terms ''tankoubon'' and ''tankōbon'' are sometimes used amongst online communities. Japanese people frequently refer to manga ''tankōbon'' by the English [[loanword]] {{nihongo|"comics"|コミックス|komikkusu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Shiraishi |first1=Saya S.|editor1-last= Katzenstein |editor1-first= Peter J. |editor2-last= Shiraishi |editor2-first= Takashi |title= Network Power: Japan and Asia |date=1997|publisher= Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=9780801483738|page=252|edition=Illustrated |chapter=Japan's Soft Power: Doraemon Goes Overseas|quote=The term Komikkusu (for comic books) spread and because of its English origin…}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word "manga", as they are the same thing. The term also refers to the format itself—a comic collection in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] sized (roughly 13 × 18&amp;nbsp;cm, or 5" × 7") book (as opposed to the larger 18 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm / 7" × 10" format used by traditional American graphic novels). Although Japanese manga tankobon may be in various sizes, the most common are [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant| Japanese B6]] (12.8 × 18.2&amp;nbsp;cm, 5.04" × 7.17") and [[Paper size|ISO A5]] (14.8 × 21.0&amp;nbsp;cm, 5.83" × 8.2").  The ''tankōbon'' format has made inroads in the American comics market, with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format, which is sometimes also called "digest format" or "[[digest size]]". In the United States, many manga are released in the so-called "Tokyopop trim" or "Tokyopop size" (approximately 5" × 7.5").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brienza|first=Casey E.|date = June 2009|title=Books, Not Comics: Publishing Fields, Globalization, and Japanese Manga in the United States | journal =Publishing Research Quarterly|publisher=Springer |location=New York|volume=25|issue=2|pages = 101–17 | issn =1053-8801|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f11798l55w2872n0/|accessdate=March 12, 2010|doi = 10.1007/s12109-009-9114-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special formats==
===''Aizōban''===
An '''''aizōban''''' ({{nihongo2|愛蔵版|lit. "favorite printing edition"}}) is a [[Special edition|collector's edition]] [[volume (bibliography)|volume]] . These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition, special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, and so on. ''Aizōban'' are generally printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and collectability of those few copies made. The ''aizōban'' format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as ''[[Fruits Basket]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' and ''[[Gundam_The_Origin|Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin]]'' being reissued in ''aizōban'' format.  Generally only the most popular manga are released in this format.

A '''''bunkoban''''' ({{nihongo2|文庫版}}) edition refers to a ''tankōbon'' printed in ''[[bunkobon|bunko]]'' format, or a typical Japanese novel-sized volume. ''Bunkoban'' are generally [[Paper size|A6]] size (105 × 148&amp;nbsp;mm) and thicker than ''tankōbon'' and, in the case of manga, usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release. In the case of manga, a ''bunkoban'' tends to contain considerably more pages than a ''tankōbon'' and usually a republication of ''tankōbon'' of the same title which may or may not have been out of print. Thus, the ''bunko'' edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes. For example, ''[[Please Save My Earth]]'' was published in 21 ''tankōbon'' volumes, and then re-released in 12 ''bunko'' volumes. If the original manga was a ''wide-ban'' release, the ''bunkoban'' release will generally have the same number of volumes. The term is commonly abbreviated in Japanese to just ''bunko'' (without the ''-ban'').

===''Kanzenban''===
The '''''kanzenban''''' ({{nihongo2|完全版|lit. "complete edition"}}) is another term sometimes used to denote this kind of a special release. A ''kanzenban'' release is generally [[ISO 216|A5 size]] (148 × 210&amp;nbsp;mm) and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers, color pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, features that are often omitted or converted to [[grayscale]] in standard ''tankōbon'' releases. While the ''aizōban'' appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes, the term ''kanzenban'' emphasizes their completeness, though it is likewise generally reserved for popular manga such as ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]''.

===''Shinsōban''===
Similar to a ''wide-ban'', a {{nihongo|'''''shinsōban'''''|新装版}} is a new edition released with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new color pages and other extras. For example, in 2002, ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was reedited; some pages were completely redrawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. Plus, the chapters were redivided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

===''Sōshūhen''===
The '''''sōshūhen''''' ({{nihongo2|総集編|lit. "complete collection"}}) is a relatively new format published by [[Shueisha]] beginning in 2008. A ''sōshūhen'' edition is [[ISO 216|B5 size]] (176 × 250&amp;nbsp;mm), larger than a ''kanzenban'', and similarly reproduces chapter covers and color pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews. The majority of ''sōshūhen'' releases are for popular manga with ongoing serializations. They also contain far more pages than a standard ''tankōbon'' and thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes; ''[[Naruto]]'' Part I was originally published in 27 ''tankōbon'' volumes, but was completed in just eight ''sōshūhen'' volumes.

===''Wide-ban''===
A '''''wide-ban''''' or '''''waidoban''''' ({{Nihongo2|ワイド版}}) edition is larger ([[ISO 216|A5]] size) than a regular ''tankōbon''. Many manga, particularly [[Seinen manga|seinen]] and [[josei manga]], are published in ''wide-ban'' editions after magazine serialization, and are never released in the ''tankōbon'' format that is common in [[shōnen manga]] and [[shōjo manga]]. When a series originally published in ''tankōbon'' format is re-released in ''wide-ban'' format, each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition, and therefore the series will consist of fewer volumes. For example, ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' was originally released in 15 ''tankōbon'' volumes, but was republished as 10 ''wide-ban'' volumes.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

professionals of these sectors.
[[File:LOGO_TEN_COMPLET.jpg|frame]]

==Background==

The platform of Tenstar Community Movement was created in 2000 by [[Abbas Gharib]] with other professionals and artists both in Europe and Middle East to support the creative people and to defend their sectors, working through the possible comparative dialogues with the world of Western advanced, cultures and disciplines within targeted initiatives in arts and creativity. Its name at the origins, was  "Ten - International Developments", with the actions in the [[Post-contemporary]] domai for the ten creative areas to support young designers and artists.

In 2008, this Platform was transferred to Italy to become a Registered Italian [[Voluntary association|association]] and to implement better its actions, in the European environments best suited to create a  container for its concepts and a network for its objectives believing that the Educational sectors, including public and private services are forming large parts of creative areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), ''Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mœglin, Pierre (2010), ''Les Industries éducatives'', Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Vision==

This Movement believes that its commitment for the social regeneration, by working within the interactions of its creative sectors is also a valid contribution for passing from an old energy-based, to a new knowledge based society. In these tasks, its vision through the creative concepts, leads to the overcoming of the current models in the field of artistic expression to the new creative formats, projected toward the future. &lt;br&gt; 
The mission wants to see rebuilt, the legacy of artistic and cultural heritage of the city artifacts, which are meaningful as the best spatial places, capable of accommodating art and culture experiences, creation of employments with  value added sustainable production, for an advanced structural economy of culture and creativity for a [[post-industrial society]], i.e. a knowledge society.

==New organizers with new tasks==

New organizers of "Tenstar Community" in Italy are Sandra Villa, an architect and designer, Samì Gharib, a sociologist and expert in communication and Leila Gharib who is a Musician and art performer.&lt;br&gt;
The commitments of "TEN" coincide with the current economic and social needs of innovation, so that the ten creative areas and the ten goals of the Association remain being active in the educational, cultural and creative sectors, that are engines for the growth and development,&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard, ''The Rise of the Creative Class And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life'', Basic Books, 2002, new edition 2012, {{ISBN|0465029930}}.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the "creative citizens' rights" for a knowledge society, a World Without Poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Social Business and the Future of Capitalism.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Continuing.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Continuing alt text|Still from '''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd ''' taken from vdb.org]] --&gt;
'''''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' ''' is a [[video]] directed by Arthur Ginsberg and Video Free America involving footage filmed between 1970 and 1975 following the lives and marriage of Carel Rowe and Ferd Eggan. Originally shown as a 3- channel video, 8-monitor installation including live feed of the audience for [[The Kitchen]] in New York in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Gould. http://areachicago.org/ferd-eggan-1946-2007/,  Area Chicago: Ferd Eggan 1946-2007&lt;/ref&gt;  the edited video is now distributed by [[Video Data Bank]] and [[Electronic Arts Intermix]]. The edited video consists of an hour-long tape selected from over 30 hours of footage that includes both the footage of the marriage and subsequent consummation, shot from 1971- 1972, and footage of an interview of Carel, Ferd, and Ginsberg produced for [[WNET]]'s Video and Television Review in 1975. The video is most readily available as a 33:15 segment on a collection of videos and video segments produced by Video Data Bank, ''Surveying the First Decade: Volume One: Program 3: Approaching Narrative: "There are Problems to be Solved"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vdb.org/titles/continuing-story-carel-and-ferd-excerpt Video Data Bank, The Continuing story of Carel and Ferd&lt;/ref&gt;''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' is often classified as video vérité, somewhere in between [[cinéma vérité]] and [[reality television]], though the footage predates [[An American Family]], often considered the first example of reality television.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2957 Electronic Arts Intermix, The Continuing story of Carel and Ferd&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' blends modes of camera address, featuring shots taken by Ginsberg of the couple in private or among friends, as well as first-person camera confessional shots.&lt;ref&gt;Renov, Michael. "Video Confessions." The Subject of Documentary. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2004. 201-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg, through the recently founded Video Free America, received some of the first Sony [[Portapak]]s in America in order to shoot the footage.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Indiana. http://www.poz.com/articles/221_1548.shtml. POZ, Inside Agitator&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeking to film the making of a pornographic film, Ginsberg found Carel and Ferd, who were looking to make an erotic film from their wedding, in order to repay a man whose car Ferd had recently crashed. Ginsberg began shooting the day that Richard, an old friend of Carels, came by to talk about the wedding. This initial session was spontaneous, and in this instance Ginsberg says that in using video media, he was able to capture this footage impulsively, the video came about by chance. Though the footage is centered on the event of the wedding, the camera's insertion into the lives of Carel and Ferd before the event means that much of the footage anticipates the wedding self-consciously.&lt;ref name="Phillips_98_101"&gt;Phillips, Glenn. "Arthur Ginsberg and Video Free America." California Video: Artists and Histories. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2008. 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the footage is cut to highlight specific moments and events, most of the footage is edited straightforwardly so as to not interrupt the narrative flow, the limited editing testament to Ginsberg's belief that with videotape any editing at all is "sapping its strength as a real-time medium."&lt;ref name="Phillips_98_101"/&gt;

==Synopsis ==
''The Continuing Story of Carol and Ferd'' takes on a loose long-form narrative, with two main subjects in a circle of friends, primarily shot in San Francisco. Carel Rowe, a filmmaker and erotic film actress and Ferd Eggan, a queer junkie, seek to be married, in part for the "media show" of their marriage and in part, a genuine desire to express their love for one another through the legal union of marriage. The footage features several others in their social group, notably Richard, a previous paramour of Carel's, who appears in an attempt to convince Carel and Ferd to not get married, as well as in the actual marriage scene. The video also features several unnamed friends, often present and sometimes addressed during the filming. Both Carel and Ferd also mention many others in their circle, including Ferd's alleged lovers, a source of contention between the two. On camera, the two kiss, interrogate one another, banter, argue, and have sex. The camera documents their intimacy as well as interrupts it, as they address the camera directly and answer questions asked by Ginsberg, behind the camera. After a fight scene, Ginsberg asks an unnamed friend in the shot whether the couple is fighting because the camera is on, to which the friend replies; “Oh I don’t think they’re doing it because the camera is on, but the camera's affecting them." In the WNET broadcast the two refer to the camera as a catalyst for action, and that their behavior in the presence of the camera was performance of only certain realities. The wedding itself is shot with more jump cuts, interviewing guests and featuring multiple close-up shots of details of the ceremony. The ceremony is a combination of a [[Jewish]] service and a media show, referencing [[Marshall Mcluhan]]'s [[the medium is the message]]. The wedding footages concludes with loud and obviously staged shots of the consummation of the marriage. In this footage the camera men are present and visible, the camera's whirring is recorded, and the camera men shout directions at the couple.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd. Dir. Arthur Ginsberg. Video Data Bank: Surveying the First Decade Volume 1, 1972-5. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The WNET program ran the video with the earlier black and white shots interspersed with later footage of [[Jon Carroll]], Ginsberg, Rowe, Eggan in a video studio, edited to seem as though they were watching and commenting on the earlier footage. The first instance of later footage is overlaid with scrolling text that introduces the program as it is being broadcast. The scrolling text introduction reads:
"Video and Television Review brings you "The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd",  a documentary soap opera set in October 1970, when Carel Rowe and Ferd Eggan were about to "tie the knot" they invited a third partner to join the marriage, a portable video camera. Which for a while became the most demanding partner of all. For the next hour we join Carel and Ferd along with the tapemaker Arthur Ginsberg and Jon Carroll, the west coast editor of the Village Voice as they watch their story on tape again. It is a story about marriage, about sexual identity and about living too close to an electronic medium.”&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

Though the footage was taken and presented before its appearance on public television, the WNET program ran after the original run of ''An American Family'' on PBS, linking the two as examples of precursors to reality television, early attempts at introducing the camera into daily life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6908">'''''The Journal of John Woolman''''' is an autobiography by [[John Woolman]] which was published posthumously in 1774 by Joseph Crukshank, a Philadelphia [[Quaker]] printer. Woolman's journal is one of the longest continually published books in North America since it has never been out of print.

The Journal adds to his other published works and gives greater evidence to his character as he discusses ideas of anti-slavery and anti-materialism as well as discussing power's ability to corrupt. The work also discusses God's divine power and goodness for all on the earth. 

The work has remained in print due to its focus on making life simple and the hopeful message of God's divine goodness.  Woolman is one of the first early American writers besides [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] who is a not a Puritan. Puritans were the most prevalent writers in Early America, and it was during the time of this publication that writing began to move away from being by only Puritan authors. Woolman's writing is at the forefront of this transition.

== Anti-Slavery ==

=== Slavery ===
Woolman's Journal focuses much on his decision to support [[anti-slavery]]. The struggle is first seen when he discusses how he was required to write a bill of sale for a Quaker friend who had sold a slave. He completed the bill of sale because it was part of his job and the man that sold the slave was also a Quaker however, after this even Woolman took a more official stance in regard to his opinion, even explaining during the actual event that he "believed slavekeeping to be a practice inconsistent with the Christian religion."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthology of American literature|last=McMichael|first=George|last2=Leonard|first2=James|publisher=Longman|year=2011|isbn=9780205779390|edition=10|location=Boston|pages=293-301|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His journal shows his inner turmoil as he grapples with understanding how he truly feels about the selling and buying of slaves that eventually led to publishing works such as his ''[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N05781.0001.001/1:3?rgn=div1;view=fulltext Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes].''  

Slavery is prominent in Woolman's journal, and it returns again shortly after the scene with the bill of sale as he discusses further opinions he has on the subject. He takes time to discuss those who he visited that did not take care of their slaves and how that made him feel uncomfortable while visiting. In contrast, Woolman discusses individuals who did take care of their slaves and how that made him feel more at ease. Shortly after that comparison, Woolman moves beyond the treatment of slaves and reflects on the idea that even if slaves were well cared for, they were still taken from their homes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His continual discourse on slavery in his journal makes Woolman one of the first abolitionists.

=== Power ===
Woolman addresses one of the issues of slavery to be men having too much power: "men having power too often misapplied it...we made slaves of the Negroes and the Turks made slaves of the Christians."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an idea already a large part of American heritage as many who traveled to America were seeking freedom of some kind. Woolman's focus on how power corrupts will continue to be impactful as Americans push further away from England (which is what had been occurring when Joseph Crukshank published this journal). 

== God's Divine Goodness ==
=== Quakers and Puritans ===
Woolman spends time in his journal writing about his relationship with God and his perspective on God. He discusses that as early as the age of 7 he "began to be acquainted with the operations of divine love."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His perspective on God and God's love is important, as it offers clear contrasts from the opinions that [[Puritans|Puritans had]]. Puritans believed in a less tolerable God, and as Jonathan Edwards in ''[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&amp;context=etas Sinners in the Hands of An Angry God]'' suggests, a God who does not care for those on Earth, nearly as much as Woolman suggests. Woolman's journal speaks of a God who gives revelation and creates a feeling of sweetness as well as strong feelings of mercy. 

=== Tolerance ===
The opinion on God's love and his strong mercy is what makes Woolman and other Quakers more tolerant to others. Woolman writes: "I found no narrowness respecting sects and opinions, but believed that sincere, upright-hearted people in every Society who truly loved God were accepted of him."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a very different belief from those of other major religions in American at the time. The Puritans were very intolerant, even within their own ranks--intolerance is one of the causes of the [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]. Quakers' differing opinion on God is also what brings about a major dislike of Quakers by Puritans. They could not stand the opinions of Quakers and considered it a type of religious heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Crisler, Jesse. Brigham Young University Class Lecture, 12 October 2016, Joseph Fielding Smith Building, Provo, UT.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolman does not discuss this in his Journal, instead focusing on what he knows and believes. In fact, Woolman believes that tolerance and mercy towards others were given from God: "he whose tender mercies are over all his works hath placed a principle in the human mind which incites to exercise goodness towards every living creature." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These kinds of connections involving tolerance and mercy towards other people are what makes Woolman's writings easier to connect with. He appears more real and sincere because of his tolerance towards others. Christians now connect with his opinions on mercy, and this is part of the reason he has remained in print since the first publication of his journal.

== Anti-Materialism ==
Woolman did many things in his life, varying from merchant, to tailor, to Quaker preacher. Along this path he decided that his wealth and prosperity were hurting him and his relationship with God: "the increase became my burden."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He turned away from all his merchandise and placed his focus somewhere else, no longer even desiring it.  

This aspect of Woolman's writing moves beyond Quaker ideals. It is something that contains aspects of Americanism, also portrayed in later authors like [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]] as well as [[Walt Whitman]]. He in some ways follows [[transcendentalism]]. 

Woolman seems to believe in the importance of anti-mercantilism, as following his decision to forgo his wealth he becomes much more visionary and believes to become closer to God.

'''''The Lute Player''''' refers to a painting from 1623 or 1624 now in [[the Louvre]] by the [[Haarlem]] painter [[Frans Hals]], showing a smiling actor wearing a jester's costume and playing a lute.

This painting was documented by [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1883, [[Ernst Wilhelm Moes]] in 1909 and [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote "98. A FOOL WITH A MANDOLINE. B. 45; M. 216.- Half-length. A man turned half-right, in a red costume trimmed with yellow. He has long hair, and wears a red and yellow cap. His head is seen in full face ; he looks up to the left. With his right hand he touches the strings of a mandoline ; his left hand grasps the neck. Very freely handled. Especially good are the various contrasting flesh-tones, the red and yellow of the costume, and the reflections in the eyes. [Compare 95.] Signed in the right at top, F. H. ; canvas, about 29 inches by 24 inches. A copy (B. 16, and see M. 216) is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1907 catalogue, No. 1093 ; it measures 26 inches by 24 inches, having rather less at the foot than the original. In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris.."&lt;ref&gt; [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/69/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on ''A Fool with a Mandoline''; catalog number 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theme of a lute player painted at half length originated in Italy, and the Dutch painter [[Dirck van Baburen]] first introduced this theme in the Northern Netherlands with his lute player of 1622. Baburen's player is pointing his lute towards the viewer with his mouth open in song. Hals' player is looking up and smiling naturally, as if he is playing with a singer or another musician not in view. This painting is a good example of Hals' "rough style" of painting with loose brush strokes.

A [[Copy of Lute Player by Frans Hals|period copy]] now in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] has been dated before 1626 based on an engraving, and it has been attributed variously to Hals, his brother [[Dirk Hals|Dirk]], and [[Judith Leyster]].&lt;ref&gt;Frans Hals: Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962., pp 35-36, publication Frans Hals Museum, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-134 De luitspeler, ca. 1623 - 1624] by unknown copyist in the [[Rijksmuseum]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/18120 Record for the copy of the Lute player] in the RKD&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other paintings of lute players by Hals are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hals was not the only painter to be influenced by Baburen. [[Hendrik ter Brugghen]] painted several lute players in the 1620s, and a few of them seem to merge aspects of Baburen and Hals, though his later version seems to follow Hals more closely.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later influences==
This painting has been copied by other artists, most notably by [[David Bailly]] in his 1651 self-portrait with his artist's influences, and by [[Adriaan de Lelie]] with his 1813 self-portrait with Josephus Augustinus Brentano, including this painting on the wall of Brentano's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/180472 Brentano's art collection by Lelie] in the RKD&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of the painting have also been copied, such as the pose of the hands and the upward smiling face, such as [[Jan Steen]]'s self-portrait as a smiling lute player.

'''''Trouble''''' is a free independent monthly magazine for the promotion of visual and performing arts and culture. ''Trouble Magazine'', a company that is co-directed by artists Steve and Melissa Proposch, publishes and distributes the title in the [[AppStore]] and online at [http://www.troublemag.com/ troublemag.com].

==History and profile==
''Trouble'' was started in [[Newstead, Victoria|Newstead, Australia]], in 2004. The first issue featured a cover image of ''The Young Family'' (2002-3) by [[Patricia Piccinini]], which had been recently acquired by the [[Bendigo Art Gallery]]. The first magazine consisted of 16 black and white pages, and the 1,000 copies that were printed soon disappeared from around 50 chosen outlets around Bendigo and Castlemaine in central Victoria. In 2011 a CAB audit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditbureau.org.au/about_cab.php Audit Bureaux of Australia – Circulations Audit Board]{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the magazine’s circulation confirmed a figure of 20,000 free copies of ''Trouble'' being distributed nationally in Australia each month. ''Trouble'' magazine is edited and designed by Steve Proposch, and continues to publish contemporary material of particular interest to artists, performers and arts consumers.

In August 2013 ''Trouble'' developed an IOS app.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/app/id668359617?mt=8 Trouble magazine app]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Reference to the Turoe Stone at Castlegrange, Athleague, County Roscommon.jpg|thumb|240px|Reference to the Turoe stone at the Castlestrange stone '''Click to read''']]
The '''Turoe stone''' is a [[granite]] stone decorated in a [[Celtic art|Celtic]] style located in the village of [[Bullaun, County Galway|Bullaun]], [[County Galway]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], 6&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Loughrea]] off the [[R350 road (Ireland)|R350]] [[Regional road (Ireland)|regional road]].&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably dates to about the period 100 BC to 100 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, D.W., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dDV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181 ''The Archaeology of Celtic Art''], p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The stone is now positioned in a covered protective structure on the lawn in front of Turoe House, set in a concrete base surrounded by a metal cattle grill.&lt;ref name="MI"&gt;{{cite web | title=Turoe Stone, County Galway| work=Mythical Ireland | url=http://www.mythicalireland.com/ancientsites/turoe/index.html | accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The top half of the stone is covered with a continuous abstract curvilinear [[La Tène style]] design similar to that on the [[Castlestrange stone]] in [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;

==History==
It was for centuries a curiosity at a ''lios'', or fairy fort, some 3&amp;nbsp;km from Bullaun, but was moved to the present location at Turoe Farm, in the late 19th century. It was probably saved from vandalism or worse, but the historic provenance has been destroyed. The religious or ceremonial purposes of the stone are lost in time.

[[George Coffey]], in his 1904 paper for the [[Royal Irish Academy]] on the subject of La Tène art, said that the stone had been moved in the 1850s from the [[Ringfort|rath]] of Feerwore site.&lt;ref name="MI"/&gt;

In 2007, a proposal to remove the Turoe Stone from its location near Loughrea due to concerns that the stone is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the elements, met fierce local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Loughrea opposes Turoe Stone move | work=Galway Independent (17 October 2007) | url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/loughrea-opposes-turoe-stone-move/ | accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 17 July 2014, it has been temporarily removed from the Turoe Petting Farm for cleaning due to fungus growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rmchapple.blogspot.com/2013/05/release-iron-age-one-whats-happening-to.html|title=Robert M Chapple, Archaeologist: Release the Iron Age One!: What's happening to the Turoe Stone?|last=Chapple|first=Robert M.|date=2013-05-17|website=Robert M Chapple, Archaeologist|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The stone was originally outside the rath of Feerwore, in Bullaun townland. Excavation yielded much material suggesting that an open site dating to the late centuries BC had been later enclosed.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Turoe, County Galway: phallic stone | work=Irish Megaliths | url=http://www.irishmegaliths.org.uk/zTuroe.htm | accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vieux Luxembourg''' is a porcelain design used by [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]].  One of the oldest [[Europe]]an [[porcelain]] manufacturers, [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]]’s first pattern, Vieux [[Luxembourg]] is still in production.

Villeroy and Boch’s Vieux Luxembourg is reminiscent of the designs that were imported from the [[Orient]] during the 16th and 17th centuries.  The porcelain body of Vieux Luxembourg is accented with a [[scalloped]] rim and [[cobalt]] blue trim.  Floral [[sprays]] are spread across the body of each piece. 

For Villeroy &amp; Boch, that step was the establishment of a pottery in [[Audun-le-Tiche]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] on April 1st, 1748 their first pattern, Vieux Luxembourg.  Just a few decades later, the enterprise counted among the finest of European craftsmen, acclaimed as “Francois Boch et Freres, Manufacture Imperiale et Royale” of [[Septfontaines]], near the city of Luxembourg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28637">[[File:ShafttombMNAH.jpg|350px|thumb|Reconstruction of excavated [[shaft tomb]] exhibited at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia]], México.]]
The '''Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to its south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there is not wide agreement on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM].&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally regarded as of [[Purépecha culture|Purépecha]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_13 p. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary with the [[Aztec]]s, it became apparent in the middle of the 20th century, as a result of further research, that the artifacts and tombs were instead over 1000 years older.  Until recently, the looted artifacts were all that was known of the people and culture or cultures that created the shaft tombs.  So little was known, in fact, that a major 1998 exhibition highlighting these artifacts was subtitled: "Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past".&lt;ref&gt;See Townsend, Richard (1998) ''Ancient West Mexico: Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past'', Thames &amp; Hudson. &lt;br&gt; Also, in the fourth edition of his ''Mexico: from the Olmecs to the Aztecs'', [[Michael Coe]] talks about "our abysmal ignorance of the prehistory of the area", p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now thought that, although shaft tombs are widely diffused across the area, the region was not a unified [[cultural area]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says, for example, that "At no time in the pre-Hispanic era did any political or cultural entity impose itself on the whole region, even though certain cultural patterns (such as the building of shaft-and-chamber tombs) have in fact been widely diffused", Michelet p. 328.  Beekman (2000, p.  393) makes the same argument.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists, however, still struggle with identifying and naming the ancient western Mexico cultures of this period.

==Description==
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archaeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]]

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years – for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but is linked to Central, rather than Western, Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and Teuchitlan, constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although there is not wide agreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Mexico [[shaft tomb]]s are characterized by a vertical or nearly vertical shaft, dug 3 to 20 metres down into what is often underlying volcanic [[tuff]].  The base of the shaft opens into one or two (occasionally more) horizontal chambers, perhaps 4 by 4 metres (varying considerably), with a low ceiling.  The shaft tombs were often associated with an overlying building.

Multiple burials are found in each chamber and evidence indicates that the tombs were used for families or lineages over time.&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., p. 102.&lt;br&gt; Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page].&lt;/ref&gt;  The labor involved in the creation of the shaft tombs along with the number and quality of the grave goods indicate that the tombs were used exclusively by the society's [[elite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the shaft tomb cultures were highly stratified at this early date.

The sites of El Opeño and [[La Campana (archaeological site)|La Campana]] in [[Colima]] feature some shaft tombs, and are often associated with the [[Capacha]] culture.

[[Grave goods]] within these tombs include hollow ceramic figures, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and [[shell jewelry]], semi-precious stones, pottery (which often contained food), and other household implements such as spindle whorls and [[metate]]s (see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  More unusual items include [[conch shell]] trumpets covered with stucco and other appliques.  Unlike those of other Mesoamerican cultures such as the [[Olmec]] and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], shaft tomb artifacts carry little to no iconography and so are seemingly bereft of symbolic or religious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias (1957) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plentiful ceramic figurines have attracted the most attention, and are among the most dramatic and interesting produced in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, these ceramics were apparently the primary outlet for artistic expression for the shaft tomb cultures and there is little to no record of associated monumental architecture, [[stela]]e, or other public art.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vast majority of these ceramics are without [[provenance]], analysis has largely focused on the ceramics' styles and subjects.

===Styles===
The major stylistic groups include:

*[[Ixtlán del Rio (archaeological site)|Ixtlan del Rio]].  These abstract figurines have flat, squarish bodies with highly stylized faces complete with nose rings and multiple earrings.  Seated figurines have thin rope-like limbs while the standing figurines have short stocky limbs.  One of the first styles to be described, noted ethnographer, and caricaturist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] stated that it "reaches the limits of absurd, brutal caricature, a peculiar aesthetic concept that relishes the creation of haunting subhuman monstrosities".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian [[George Kubler]] finds that "the square bodies, grimacing mouths, and staring eyes convey a disturbing expression which is only in part resolved by the animation and plastic energy of the turgid forms".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinesco style reclining female - Nayarit Mexico - 300 BCE-300 CE.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A Chinesco-style figurine (Type C), showing the archetypal puffy, slit-like eyes and short tapered legs.]]

*"Chinesca" or "Chinesco" figurines were named by art dealers after their supposed Chinese-like appearance. An early type, Chinesco is identified with Nayarit&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and up to five major subgroups have been identified, although there is considerable overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson state that the Chinesco types "merge in a rather complex fashion", p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Type A figurines, the so-called "[[:Image:Chinesca Nayarit.jpg|classic Chinesco]]",&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; are realistically rendered.  One prominent curator, Michael Kan, finds that "their calm, subtle exterior suggests rather than demonstrates emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Type A figures are so similar to one another that it has been suggested that they were the production of a single "school".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 17, who references Peter Furst (1966) "Shaft Tombs, Shell Trumpets and Shamanism", Ph. D. dissertation, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Types B through E are more abstract, characterized by puffy, slit-like eyes blended into the face, and broad rectangular or triangular heads.  These figures are often shown seated or reclining, with shortened bulbous legs quickly tapering to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ameca style, associated with Jalisco, is characterized by an elongated face and a high forehead which is often capped by braids or turban-like headgear. The [[aquiline nose]] is also elongated and the large eyes are wide and staring, with pronounced rims created by adding separate strips of clay ("fillets") around the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 91.  These "fillets" are often referred to as appliqués.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide mouth is closed or slightly opened and the large hands have carefully delineated nails.  Kubler detects both an early "sheep-faced" style that seem "eroded or melted in the continuous passages of modelling that unite rather than divide the parts of the body" and a later style which are "more animated and more incisively articulated".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Colima shaft tomb dog (T Aleto).jpg|300px|thumb|A fat, and perhaps fattened, dog from Colima &lt;ref&gt;In discussing ceramic types, Kubler, p. 195, refers to the "fattened and edible dogs of Colima".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*Colima ceramics can be identified by their smooth, round forms and their warm brown-red [[slip (ceramics)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/cam/ho_1979.206.478.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  Colima is particularly known for its wide range of animal, especially dog, figurines.  Human subjects within the Colima style are more "mannered and less exuberant" than other shaft tomb figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles include El Arenal, San Sebastián, and Zacatecas.  Although there is general agreement on style names and characteristics, it is not unanimous.  Moreover, these styles often overlap to one degree or another, and many figurines defy categorization.

===Subject matter===
Common subjects of shaft tomb tradition ceramics are:

*Ceramic tableaus showing several or even several dozen people engaged in various seemingly typical activities.  Concentrated in highland Nayarit and adjoining Jalisco, these tableaus present rich [[ethnography|ethnographic]] insight into [[funeral|funerary]] practices, the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], architecture (most importantly perishable architecture), and perhaps even religious thought during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|late Formative period]].&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor for discussion of the religious insight offered by these tableaus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tableaus are almost photographic in their detail and have even been associated with architecture ruins in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Foster et al., p. 47 as well as Wiegand, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Shaft tomb culture village scene.jpg|300px|thumb|A characteristic circular ceramic tableau showing more than a dozen musicians and dancers]]
*Ceramic dogs are widely known from looted tombs in Colima.  Dogs were generally believed in [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures to represent soul guides of the dead&lt;ref&gt;Among many others, see Coe et al., pp. 103–104, or Kubler, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and several dog ceramics wear human masks.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=colima%20dog%20mask&amp;w=all these photos] from Flickr for an example of a mask-wearing Colima dog.  Another is part of the Stafford Collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (see ''Sculpture of Ancient West Mexico, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, it should also be noted that dogs were often the major source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 45 and many others.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ancestor (or marriage) pairs of female and male figurines are common among shaft tomb tradition grave goods.  These figurines, perhaps representing ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Heritage_of_Power/Heritage_of_Power_more.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  may be joined or separate and often are executed in the [[Ixtlán del Río]] style.
*Many shaft tomb figurines, spanning various Western Mexico styles and locations, wear a horn set high on the forehead.  Several theories have been advanced for these horns: that they show that the figure is a [[shaman]], that they are abstract [[conch|conch shells]] (a not uncommon shaft tomb relic)&lt;ref&gt;The Las Cebollas tomb contained 125 conch shells (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 39).  Beekman (2000) lists conch shell trumpets, along with dogs and horned figures, as three examples of "common symbolic threads" of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, are an emblem of rulership, or are a [[phallic symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Danien.&lt;/ref&gt;  These theories are not mutually exclusive.

===Uses===
While these ceramics were obviously recovered as [[grave goods]], there is a question of whether they were specifically created for a mortuary rite, or whether they were used prior to burial, perhaps by the deceased.  While some ceramics do show signs of wear, it is as yet unclear whether this was the exception or the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

===Western Mexico cultures===
Considerable effort has been made connecting the shaft tomb tradition to the [[Teuchitlán tradition]], a complex society that occupies much the same geography as the shaft tomb tradition.

Unlike the typical [[Mesoamerican pyramids]] and rectangular central plazas, the Teuchitlán tradition is marked by central circular plazas and unique conical pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Weigand, p. 402.  Weigand contends that the structures of the Teuchitlán tradition's ceremonial architecture "are unique in the Mesoamerican architectural repertoire and indeed are not found anywhere else in the world".&lt;/ref&gt;  This circular architectural style is seemingly mirrored in the many circular shaft tomb tableau scenes.  Known primarily from this architecture, the Teuchitlán tradition rises at roughly the same time as the shaft tomb tradition, 300 BCE, but lasts until 900 CE, many centuries after the end of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Teuchitlán tradition appears to be an outgrowth and elaboration of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (1996), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican cultures===
Because western Mexico is on the very periphery of [[Mesoamerica]], it has long been considered outside the Mesoamerican mainstream and the cultures at this time appear to be particularly insulated from many mainstream Mesoamerican influences.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, no [[Olmec]]-influenced artifacts have been recovered from shaft tombs, nor are any [[Mesoamerican calendars]] or [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]] in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; although some Mesoamerican cultural markers, particularly the Mesoamerican ballgame, are present.

[[File:Ameca style figurine from Jalisco (Zeetz Jones).jpg|right|230px|thumb|An Ameca-style figurine from Jalisco. The horn is a not-uncommon feature of many tradition figurines.  The ball would appear to link the subject to the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].]]

Despite this, the inhabitants of this area lived much like their Mesoamerican counterparts elsewhere.  The usual trio of beans, squash, and [[maize]] was supplemented with chiles, [[manioc]] and other tubers, various grains, and with animal protein from domestic dogs, turkeys, and ducks, and from hunting.  They lived in thatched roof [[wattle-and-daub]] houses, grew cotton and tobacco, and conducted some long-distance trade in obsidian and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaft tombs themselves are not encountered elsewhere in Mesoamerica and their nearest counterparts come from northwestern South America.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 50. Meighan and Nicholson state that one other example of a shaft tomb complex, dating from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]], 1000 years later, is found in [[Mixteca Alta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===South American shaft tombs===
Shaft tombs also appear in northwestern South America in a somewhat later timeframe than western Mexico (e.g. 200-300 CE in northern Peru, later in other areas).  To Dorothy Hosler, Professor of Archaeology and Ancient Technology at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], "The physical similarities between the northern South American and West Mexican tomb types are unmistakable."&lt;ref&gt;Hosler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cB-PLQpbk-4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=shaft+tomb+mexico&amp;sig=_5fJCLp_oYNekzKLGzlRPGcezWw#PPA16,M1 p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; while art historian George Kubler finds that the western Mexican chambers "resemble the shafted tombs of the upper Cauca river in Colombia".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others  disagree that the similarity of form demonstrates cultural linkages—Karen Olsen Bruhns states that "this sort of contact . . . seems mainly in the (muddled) eye of the synthesizer".&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other linkages between Western Mexico and northwestern South America have been proposed, in particular the development of metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Hosler's essay focuses on this linkage.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]].

[[File:Western Mexico Shaft tomb house 3.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A ceramic house showing the distinctive roof associated not only with the shaft tomb cultures but the subsequent [[Teuchitlan tradition]] as well.  It has been proposed that these models show the house of the living above and attached to the house of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==History of scholarly research==
The first major work to discuss artifacts associated with the shaft tomb tradition was [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz|Carl Lumholtz]]'s 1902 work, ''Unknown Mexico''.  Along with illustrations of several of the grave goods, the Norwegian explorer described a looted shaft tomb he had visited in 1896.  He also visited and described the ruins of [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the seat of [[Purépecha Empire]] some 150 miles (250&amp;nbsp;km) to the east, and was one of the first to incorrectly use the term "Tarascan" (Purépecha) to describe the shaft tomb artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 33.  Crossley.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, artist [[Diego Rivera]] began accumulating many Western Mexico artifacts for his private collection, a personal interest that sparked a wider public interest in West Mexican grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Sund, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in the late 1930s that one of the most prominent of Western Mexico archaeologists, [[Isabel Truesdell Kelly]], began her investigations.  In the period from 1944 until 1985, Kelly would eventually publish over a dozen scholarly papers on her work in this region.  In 1948, she was the first to hypothesize the existence of the "shaft tomb arc", the geographic distribution of shaft tomb sites over western Mexico (see map above).&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Salvador Toscano challenged the attribution of shaft tomb artifacts to the Purépechans,&lt;ref&gt;See Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge that was echoed in 1957 by [[Miguel Covarrubias]] who firmly declared that [[Purépecha culture]] appeared only "after the 10th century".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, pp. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Toscano's and Covarrubias's views were later upheld by radiocarbon dating of plundered shaft tombs' charcoal and other organic remains salvaged in the 1960s by Diego Delgado and Peter Furst.  As the result of these excavations and his ethnological investigations of the modern-day indigenous [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Cora people]]s of Nayarit, Furst proposed that the artifacts were not only mere representations of ancient peoples, but also contained deeper significance.  The model houses, for example, showed the living dwelling in context with the dead – a miniature [[cosmogram]] – and the horned warriors (as discussed above) were shaman battling mystical forces.&lt;ref&gt;See Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Hasso von Winning published an exhaustive classification of Western Mexico shaft tomb artifacts (including, for example, the Chinesco A through D types mentioned above), a classification still largely in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Among others, see Meighan and Nicholson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 discovery of an unlooted shaft tomb at Huitzilapa is the latest major milestone, providing "the most detailed information to date on the funerary customs" associated with shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;López Mestas C. and Jorge Ramos de la Vega, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;
