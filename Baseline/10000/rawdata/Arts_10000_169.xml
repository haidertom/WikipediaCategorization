== History ==
In 1939, philanthropist and social advocate Aileen Osborn Webb formed the Handcraft Cooperative League of America, an affiliation of craft groups organized to develop markets in metropolitan areas for rural craftsmen. The same year, the American Handcraft Council is formed in Delaware by [[Anne Morgan (philanthropist)|Anne Morgan]], a friend and neighbor of Webb. In 1940, Webb's League opens a cooperative retail venue called America House at 7 East 54th Street in Manhattan. In 1941, they publish a first, untitled issue of what would later become the magazine ''Craft Horizons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|title=Craft Horizons, November 1941 (Volume 1, Number 1)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Anne Morgan's American Handcraft Council and Aileen Osborn Webb's Handcraft Cooperative League of America merge into a single organization, the American Craftsmen's Cooperative Council, Inc. In 1943, the merged organizations initiate the American Craftsmen's Educational Council, and are granted a provisional charter from the Board of Regents of the Education Department of New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|title=craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729093430/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|archive-date=2017-07-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
For the next decade, the Council maintained their New York retail venue, initiated exhibitions featuring practicing craft artists (including "Designer Craftsmen USA", which was hosted by the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|title=Catalog of the exhibition "Designer Craftsmen U.S.A. 1953"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and hosted national competitions such as "Young Americans" for craftspeople under 30. In 1955, the American Craftsmen's Education Council shortened its name to the American Craftsmen's Council and the acronym ACC fell into use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
 
In 1956, the Council opened the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, now the [[Museum of Arts and Design]], in a brownstone purchased by Webb at 29 West 53rd Street in New York City. The museum's inaugural exhibition "Craftsmanship in a Changing World"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|title=digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured 314 objects by 180 craftspeople from 19 states. The new building also housed the offices for ''Craft Horizons'' and the council's first formal library space. The Council launched its first national conference and began publishing a newsletter, ''Outlook'', in 1957. In 1959, the Council divests in the retail space America House, which relocates to a brownstone purchased by Webb until closing 1971. In 1960, ''Craft Horizons'' is officially incorporated into the Council and subscribers are automatically enrolled as members. For the next decade, the council continues to host conferences, present and tour exhibitions through the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and expand educational and awards programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966, ACC held its first regional craft fair in Stowe, Vermont, a precursor to the annual shows the Council continues to present in Baltimore, Atlanta, Saint Paul, and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/shows|title=ACC Shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216345300/http://www.craftcouncil.org/shows|archive-date=2018-02-11|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, one year after celebrating its 25th anniversary, the American Craftsmen's Council changed its name to the American Crafts Council.

The 1970s bring many significant changes to ACC, including its first cohort of Fellows, elected in 1975. Over 200 craft artists, scholars, and philanthropists have now been honored through induction into the Council's College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|title=College of Fellows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823121352/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|archive-date=2017-08-23|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While continuing to host shows and conferences, the Council relocates in 1978 to 22 West 55th Street and in 1979 the Museum of Contemporary Crafts reopens as the American Craft Museum at 44 West 53rd Street. The same year, ''Craft Horizons'' is renamed ''American Craft'' and founder Aileen Osborn Webb dies at age 87.

Another series of relocations take place throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the American Craft Museum becomes independent. At the Council's new, larger space at 72 Spring Street, the library has space to expand throughout the 1990s, taking on significant donations from the estate of glass artist Robert Sowers and from [[Ed Rossbach]] and [[Mildred Constantine]]. Efforts  to develop a computer database for the library began in 1988, and the Council officially launches its website in 1999. In 2001, the library's catalog becomes accessible online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2000s, the Council renames and restructures its awards program and begins hosting "convenings," small-scale gatherings of key stakeholders in the field of craft meant to encourage peer-to-peer conversation. In 2010, ACC relocates from New York City to Minneapolis, MN, establishing an office and library in the historic Grain Belt Brewery building at 1224 Marshall Street NE. Not long after the relocation, the Council launches a new website that includes information for both ''American Craft'' magazine and the Council itself. In 2015, ACC launches several programs to highlight and serve emerging artists; Hip Pop, a shows initiative that provides a pathway for emerging artists to successfully take part in ACC shows, and Emerging Voices, an awards program that honors top emerging artist and scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Anak Tomb No. 3''' is a [[chamber tomb]] of [[Goguryeo]] located in [[Anak (North Korea)|Anak]], [[South Hwanghae]], [[North Korea]]. It is known for mural paintings and an epitaph. It is part of the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs]].

It was discovered in 1949 with valuable treasures having been stolen, but murals were kept in good condition.

== Epitaph and its interpretation ==

The Anak Tomb No.3 is one of few Goguryeo tombs that have epitaphs so that their dates can be determined. Its seven-lined epitaph contains the date 357, the personal name Dong Shou (冬壽), his title, his birthplace and his age at death.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[http://www.kaogu.cn/uploads/soft/2014/20140723wangfeifengdongshoumu1.pdf "冬壽墓蓮花紋研究"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113101228/http://www.kaogu.cn/uploads/soft/2014/20140723wangfeifengdongshoumu1.pdf |date=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, some scholars generally regard this site as the tomb of Dong Shou.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The inscription of Dong Shou relates that he was a general from the Xianbei state of [[Former Yan]] in Liaodong (modern [[Liaoning]], China), who fled to Goguryeo in 336 and was given a position in the former territory of the [[Lelang commandery]].&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK%3D0000594065%26danrak_no%3D%26clss_cd%3D%26top_menu_cd%3D0000000808 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081913/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000594065&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While K. H. J. Gardiner and Wonyong Kim believe this to be a Chinese tomb of excellent quality, North and other South Korean scholars believe that Dong Shou was an emigre official. Moreover, the quality of these paintings and the size of the tomb indicate that it is a royal tomb of Koguryo—a theory advocated recently by Hwi-joon Ahn and Youngsook Pak.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; North Korean scholars claim that it is the mausoleum of [[King Micheon of Goguryeo|King Micheon]] or [[King Gogugwon of Goguryeo|King Gogugwon]].

The epitaph reflects a complex situation in which Tong Shou, and Goguryeo, were put. He claimed various titles including "Minister of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]]" and "Governor of [[Changli Commandery|Changli]], [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]] and [[Daifang Commandery|Daifang]]." It is not clear whether these titles were given by the Eastern Jin or just self-designation. Scholars associate one of his title "Minister of Lelang" with the title "Duke of Lelang", which was bestowed on King Gogugwon by [[Murong Jun]] of the Former Yan in 354.

The murals found in Anak Tomb No. 3 are nearly identical with those in the [[Yuantaizi Tomb]] found in [[Liaoning]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudong.com/wiki/%E8%A2%81%E5%8F%B0%E5%AD%90%E5%A2%93&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;The Anak Tomb No. 3 is the host to multiple famous mural paintings, each giving a greater insight to the life and hierarchy of the Goguryeo people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://contents.nahf.or.kr/goguryeo/anak3/an_html_en/int1.html|title=contents.nahf.or.kr/goguryeo/anak3/an_html_en/int1.html|website=contents.nahf.or.kr|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains two portraits, one on the front wall of the west side chamber and one on the southern wall, portraying a man and a woman, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars have disputed the owner of this tomb and thus the identity of people portrayed in these murals; because of the epitaph, many believe that the images depict Dong Shou, a refugee from [[Former Yan]], and his wife, while others believe that the person depicted was the Goguryeo king, [[Gogugwon of Goguryeo|King Gogukwon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artistic Creation, Borrowing, Adaptation, and Assimilation in Koguryǒ Tomb Murals of the Fourth to Seventh Century|last=Jeon|first=Ho-Tae|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man in the mural is shown to be sitting upright and is flanked by other men who are smaller than him. He is dressed in red silk clothes with a white [http://worldhat.net/en/exhibition/kwan Kwan] over a black inner Kwan &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is staring straight out with an impersonal expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The painting of the woman resides on the southern wall of the tomb, next to that of the man, and her sitting position is slightly turned in to face the him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The woman also wears an impersonal expression, but with a notable face shape; her face, as well as the faces as the women who flank her, is round and full, different from the typical facial structure of the Goguryeo people, who had long and oval faces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The next mural in this tomb is a [[procession]] scene and resides in the corridor. It contains 250 people, including the owner of the tomb who is sitting in a cow-pulled wagon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other Goguryeo people displayed in this mural include members of a marching band, flag bearers, maids and civil officials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The large amount of people suggests the high social status of the owner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also important to note the seemingly identical, impersonal facial structure of the people included in this scene. This can be attributed to the fact that at the time when this mural was developed, the expression of individuality was not yet a developed technique in Goguryeo paintings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The inside of the eastern chamber contains a colorful mural illustrating the typical life of the Goguryeo people. The scene includes a kitchen, a meat storage room, a barn, a carriage shed, and household staff, along with other commonplace features.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mural allows scholars to analyze the daily rituals of the Goguryeo culture, and gain insight on what the house of the tomb's owner may have looked like.

'''Anti-monumentalism''' (or '''Counter-monumentalism''') is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=counter-monuments |url=http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415170228/http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]],  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."&lt;ref name="ISBN 90-5662-236-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano-Hemmer|first=Rafael|title=Alien Relationships with Public Space|journal=TransUrbanism|year=2002|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]]'s ''Bunker Hill Monument Projections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh Mahan |first=Nicole |title=Krzysztof Wodiczko;s "If You See Something...": counter-memory and the role of the artist in Post-9/11 America |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414231038/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Do-Ho Suh]]'s ''Public Figures'' can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Do-Ho|title=The Anti-Monument|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.10-detail-korean-artist/|publisher=The Walrus|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Born in Flames''''' is a 1983 [[Documentary film|documentary]]-style [[feminist]] [[fiction film]] by [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]] that explores [[racism]], [[classism]], [[sexism]], and [[heterosexism]] in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative]] United States [[Democratic socialism|socialist democracy]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E3DE1539F933A25752C1A965948260|title=Born in Flames (1983) FILM: 'BORN IN FLAMES,' RADICAL FEMINIST IDEAS|authorlink=Janet Maslin|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=November 10, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title comes from the song ''Born in Flames'' written by a member of [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Mayo Thompson]] of the band [[Red Krayola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/filmmaker-lizzie-borden-talks-about-her-scrappy-dystopian-magnum-opus/Content?oid=2788668|title=Lizzie Borden talks about her scrappy, feminist magnum opus, 'Born in Flames'|last=Baise|first=Greg|website=Detroit Metro Times|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The plot concerns two feminist groups in New York City, each voicing their concerns to the public by [[pirate radio]]. One group, led by an outspoken white lesbian, Isabel ([[Adele Bertei]]), operates "Radio Ragazza". The other group, led by a soft-spoken African-American, Honey (Honey), operates "Phoenix Radio." The local community is stimulated into action after a world-traveling political activist, Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), is arrested upon arriving at a New York City airport, and suspiciously dies while in [[police custody]]. Also, there is a Women's Army led by Hilary Hurst (Hilary Hurst) and advised by Zella ([[Florynce Kennedy|Flo Kennedy]]) that initially both Honey and Isabel refuse to join. This group, along with Norris and the radio stations, are under investigation by a callous FBI agent ([[Ron Vawter]]). Their progress is tracked by three editors ([[Becky Johnston]], [[Pat Murphy (director)|Pat Murphy]], [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) for a socialist newspaper, who go so far they get fired.

The story involves several different women coming from different perspectives and attempts to show several examples of how sexism plays out on the street, and how it can be dealt with through [[direct action]]. At one point, two men attack a woman on the street, and dozens of women on bicycles with whistles come to chase the men away and comfort the woman. The movie shows women, despite their various differences, organizing in meetings, doing radio shows, creating art, [[wheatpasting]], putting a [[condom]] on a [[human penis|penis]], wrapping raw chicken at a processing plant, etc. The film portrays a world rife with violence against women, high female unemployment, and government oppression. The women in the film start to come together to make a bigger impact, by means that some would call [[terrorism]].

Ultimately, after both radio stations are suspiciously burned down, Honey and Isabel team up and broadcast "Phoenix Ragazza Radio" from stolen [[U-Haul]] vans. They also join the Women's Army, which sends a group of terrorists to interrupt a broadcast of the [[President of the United States]] proposing that women be paid to do [[Homemaking|housework]], followed by bombing the antenna on top of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] to prevent additional such destructive messages from the mainstream.

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that nine of twelve reviews were positive; the average rating is 6.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/born_in_flames/|title=Born in Flames  (1983)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that it has "all the advantages and the disadvantages of a home movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/born-in-flames-1200425584/|title=Review: 'Born in Flames'|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1984|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Only those who already share Miss Borden's ideas are apt to find her film persuasive."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Marjorie Baumgarten of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Beautifully made, courageously edited, and swift-moving, this challenging, provocative film is a work that is both humanist and revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2001-06-20/141222/|title=Born in Flames|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=2001-06-20|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frances Dickinson of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' wrote that Borden "[handles] her story with audacity and make[s] even the driest argument crackle with humour, while the more poignant moments burn with a fierce white heat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/born-in-flames|title=Born in Flames|last=Dickinson|first=Frances|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[TV Guide]]'' rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, "This feminist film wins laurels for close attention to detail in a radical filmmaking effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/born-in-flames/review/118362/|title=Born In Flames|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greg Baise of the ''[[Metro Times]]'' called it "an early '80s landmark of indie and queer cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/Blogs/archives/2010/06/16/born-in-flames|title=Born in Flames|last=Baise|first=Greg|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=2010-06-16|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has had experienced somewhat of a renaissance after the 35mm restoration print premiered in 2016 at the Anthology Film Archives. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, "...the free, ardent, spontaneous creativity of “Born in Flames” emerges as an indispensable mode of radical change—one that many contemporary filmmakers with political intentions have yet to assimilate." He also wrote, "Borden's exhilarating collage-like story stages news reports, documentary sequences, and surveillance footage alongside tough action scenes and musical numbers; her violent vision is both ideologically complex and chilling." Melissa Anderson of The Village Voice wrote "this unruly, unclassifiable film — perhaps the sole entry in the hybrid genre of radical-lesbian-feminist sci-fi vérité — premiered two years into the Reagan regime, but its fury proves as bracing today as it was back when this country began its inexorable shift to the right."

The film is discussed in [[Christina Lane]]'s book ''Feminist Hollywood: From "Born in Flames" to "Point Break"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133947283.html|title=Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break.(Book Review)|last=Kessler|first=Kelly|work=[[Velvet Light Trap]]|date=2001-03-22|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A “graphic translation” of the movie made by artist Kaisa Lassinaro, which contains an interview of Lizzie Borden, was published by Occasional Papers in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Born in Flames, Occasional Papers, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9562605-9-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a collage composition made of screencaps with a selection of dialogues from the movie.

In 2013, a dossier on the film was published as a special issue of Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory - Volume 23, Issue 1|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/23/1|website = www.tandfonline.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an introduction from Craig Willse and Dean Spade, the dossier includes a number of essays that address race, queerness, intersectionality, radicalism, violence, and feminism in the film.

The film was restored in 2016 by [[Anthology Film Archives]]. The 35mm restoration film premiered in Feb. 2016 at the Anthology. It was very well received, with glowing reviews, from Richard Brody in New Yorker.com, The Political Science Fiction of “Born in Flames” and from many other journalists, including Melissa Anderson in The Village Voice.  Borden was invited to show the new 35mm print in Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastian, Milan, Toronto, The Edinburgh Film Festival, The London Film Festival, along with screenings in Detroit, Rochester, San Francisco, Los Angeles and including in series of "films of resistance."

''Point'' was a performance that called attention to the fact of the all-important New York City exhibition's roster of artists being over two-thirds male in a time when the numbers of women in art programs exceeded that of men.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/davis/davis3-12-07.asp|title=White Walls, Glass Ceiling|last=Davis|first=Ben|date=March 12, 2007|publisher=Artnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoban&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoban|first=Phoebe|title=The Feminist Evolution|url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/12/01/the-feminist-evolution/|work=ArtNews|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group drew on earlier feminist art protest work of the [[Guerrilla Girls]], with whom they have collaborated.&lt;ref name=hoban/&gt; Polashenski and Johnston (the latter a co-founder of the group with Mysliwiec, Kaufmann, and Dumlao) have since left the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainstormersreport.net/|title=Brainstormers|accessdate=Feb 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

In 2005, the Brainstormers performed again, in a piece entitled ''How Good Are You?'' outside the entrance to the Armory Show, dressed in [[lab coat]]s, handing out color-coded research about the levels of representation of women artists in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art galleries.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; The next year Dumlao, Kaufmann, Mysliwiec, and Polashenski published a researched piece entitled "The Cutting Edge and the Corporate Agenda" in the international journal ''Women &amp; Environments,'' for its women, art and [[community activism]] issue.&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;

In 2008, the group did a collaborative work with the [[Guerrilla Girls]] at the [[Bronx Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; Elaine Kaufmann told ''[[Art News]],'' “I think what is really important was that we were ... coming after the Guerrilla Girls, and we were still seeing the same kind of gender discrimination happening in our generation and felt compelled to do something.”&lt;ref name=hoban/&gt;

Also in 2008, the group stationed themselves at the corner of West 24th Street and 10th Avenue in Chelsea, and got passers-by to fill in [[mad libs]]-style postcards protesting about the lack of female representation in art galleries.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web|last=Fry|first=Warren|title=The Brainstormers|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/11/artseen/the-brainstormers|work=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they exhibited at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brainstormers Kindly Request That You Hand Over Your Balls|url=http://www.artfagcity.com/2009/07/30/brainstormers-kindly-request-that-you-hand-over-your-balls/|publisher=Art Fag City|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy and techniques===
The Brainstormers use similar tactics as the [[Guerrilla Girls]], such as [[Agitprop theatre]] and shocking statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schor|first=Mira|title=A Feminist Tea Party|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mira-schor/feminist-tea-party_b_821729.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the group, the fault of institutional sexism does not lie with the institutions only: In 2006, they wrote,{{quote|text= "The responsibility for the perpetuation of this systemic form of discrimination falls on a rich network of dealers, curators, institutions, and even artists themselves. Each party denies any responsibility for bringing about change and instead tries to benefit from the status quo, their decisions guided by the bottom line."&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;}}
Of their work, Maria Dumlao has also said "Our work and actions are meant to inform, excite and provoke people in a dialogue. We encourage them to act on their own terms."{{sfn|McDonough, Yona Zeldis, “On Being Brainstormers,” ''NYFA Current,'' August 2009}}

[[File:Moana_tatoo.jpg|thumb|[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]], by Robert Flaherty, the first docufiction in film history (1926)]]

'''Docufiction''' (or '''docu-fiction'''), often confused with [[docudrama]], is the cinematographic combination of [[documentary film|documentary]] and [[fiction]], this term often meaning [[narrative film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://girishshambu.blogspot.com/2006/12/six-types-of-documentary.html Reality and documentary] – at Six Types Of Documentary, article by Girish Shambu (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[film genre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html An Introduction to Genre Theory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185337/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html |date=November 18, 2011 }} by [[Daniel Chandler]] at [http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ Aberystwyth University]&lt;/ref&gt; which attempts to capture reality such as it is (as [[direct cinema]] or [[cinéma vérité]]) and which simultaneously introduces unreal elements or fictional situations in [[narrative]] in order to strengthen the representation of reality using some kind of [[artistic expression]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.videomaker.com/article/c06/18290-a-creative-treatment-of-actuality A creative treatment of actuality] – article by Peter Biesterfeld at [https://www.videomaker.com/ Videomaker], 08/07/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, it is a documentary mixed with fictional elements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesionline.it/default/tesi.asp?idt=18073 Il difficile rapporto tra fiction e non fiction che si concretizza nella docu-fiction] (The difficult relationship between fiction and non-fiction patent in docufiction) – thesis in Italian by Laura Marchesi, Faculty of Communication Sciences (Università degli Studi di Pavia) at [http://www.tesionline.it/default/index.asp Tesionline], 2005/06&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Real time (media)|real time]], filmed when the events take place, and in which the main [[character (arts)|character]] or characters — often portrayed by non-professional or amateur actors — are essentially playing themselves, or slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, in a fictionalized scenario. In this sense, docufiction may overlap to an extent with some aspects of the [[mockumentary]] format, but the terms are not synonymous.

A film genre in expansion, it is adopted by a number of [[experimental]] filmmakers.

The [[neologism]] docufiction&lt;ref&gt;What is docufiction? – See [http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf Section II, pages 37 to 75 (four chapters)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911104733/http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf |date=September 11, 2011 }} of the thesis by Prof. Theo Mäusli&lt;/ref&gt; appeared at the beginning of the 21st century.

==Origins==
The term involves a way of making films already practiced by such authors as [[Robert Flaherty]], one of the fathers of documentary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/huffman/frontier/define.html Definition of documentary – New Frontiers in American documentary] (American Studies at The University of Virginia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html The Impulse of Documentary-Fiction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052930/http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html |date=March 19, 2012 }} – Paper at [http://www.transartinstitute.org/About.html Transart Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101542/http://transartinstitute.org/About.html |date=2011-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Rouch]], later in the 20th century.

In the domain of [[visual anthropology]], the innovating role of Jean Rouch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rouge.com.au/3/rouch_valediction.html Jean Rouch 1917-2004, A Valediction] – Article by [[Michael Eaton]] at [http://www.rouge.com.au/ Rouge]&lt;/ref&gt; allows one to consider him as the father of a subgenre called [[ethnofiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction, thesis by Brian Quist, Long Island University&lt;/ref&gt; This term means: [[ethnographic]] documentary film with natives who play fictional roles. Making them play a role about themselves will help portray reality, which&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnofiction: drama as a creative research practice in ethnographic film." Journal of Media Practice 9, no. 3(2008), eScholarID:1b5648, article by Johannes Sjöberg&lt;/ref&gt; will be reinforced with [[imagery]]. A non-ethnographic [[documentary]] with fictional elements uses the same method and, for the same reasons, may be called docufiction.

==Docudrama and mockumentary==
In contrast, [[docudrama]] is usually a fictional and dramatized recreation&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sadibey.com/dosyalar/Gerekli_Seyler/Documentary_Genres.doc Docudrama: the real (his)tory Confusion of genres] – Page 2 on the thesis by Çiçek Coşkun (New York University School of Education)&lt;/ref&gt; of factual events in form of a documentary, at a time subsequent to the "real" events it portrays. A docudrama is often confused with ''docufiction'' when [[drama]] is considered interchangeable with [[fiction]] (both words meaning the same). However, "docudrama" refers specifically to [[Television film|telefilms]] or other television media recreations that dramatize certain events often with [[actor]]s.
 	
A [[mockumentary]] is also a film or television show in which fictitious events are presented in documentary format, sometimes a recreation of factual events after they took place or a comment on [[current events]], typically satirical, comedic or even dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;A television programme or film which takes the form of a serious documentary in order to satirize its subject. – definition at The Free Dictionary and Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas mockumentaries are usually fully scripted comedies or dramas that merely adopt some aspects of documentary format as a framing device, docufictions are usually not scripted, instead placing the participants in a fictionalized scenario while portraying their own genuine reactions and their own [[improvisation]]al dialogue and character development.

==First docufictions by country==

An '''enabling technology''' is an [[invention]] or [[innovation]], that can be applied to drive radical change in the capabilities of a user or culture. Enabling technologies are characterized by rapid development of subsequent derivative technologies, often in diverse fields. See [[General purpose technology]].

Equipment and/or methodology that, alone or in combination with associated technologies, provides the means to increase performance and capabilities of the user, product or process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/enabling-technology.html#ixzz2lrYdBsg3 |title=What is enabling technology? definition and meaning |website=BusinessDictionary.com |date=2016-12-05 |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

'''''Feet of Flames''''' is an [[Irish dance]] show directed by [[Michael Flatley]] and scored by [[Ronan Hardiman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1464172.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Flatley was known for the shows ''[[Riverdance]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]]''.

==History==
===Hyde Park 1998===
The Hyde Park show was first created as a one-off performance of Flatley's previous show, "Lord of the Dance". It premiered on 25 July 1998, playing to approximately 25,000 people at the Route of Kings, an open-space arena-like spot in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Although closely resembling its predecessor, this show merged troupes, added new numbers, and featured a multi-level stage for the finale as well as a live band. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo – "Feet of Flames", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by [[Freed's of London]] were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were installed and are now used in all the shows that feature Flatley. Film of the Hyde Park show was later distributed on VHS and DVD.

===2000 World Tour===
On 21 September 1999 Michael Flatley announced a "Feet of Flames" world tour for 2000. This tour began on Wednesday, 1 March 2000, in Germany. The show differed significantly from the original 1998 version. The show had new numbers, new leads, a new story line and a "whole new outlook" in the words of Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Both the original female leads [[Bernadette Flynn]] and [[Gillian Norris]] were replaced by Sarah Clark and [[Leigh Ann McKenna]]. [[Daire Nolan]] was replaced by [[Stephen Brunning]]. Both Daire Nolan and Gillian Norris went on to pursue their own careers after the 1998 show. Bernadette Flynn left to dance with Lord of the Dance troupe one until 2001. Some of the characters changed slightly in the show. Lord of the Dance became Firespirit, Saroise became The Swan and Morrighan the Temptress became Cleopatra. The Dark Lord was remained but there are sayings that they still used Don Dorcha as the name. Helen Egan's part as the little spirit became the Court Jester in the World Tour. The Highlight of the 2000 tour was Flatley and the Troupe performing in [[Budapest]] to over 100,000 people. The European part of the 2000 World Tour concluded on 29 July 2000 in [[Stormont Castle]], [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.

===2001 "Victory Tour"===

The 2001 tour, dubbed the "USA Victory Tour", had a preview show on 6 June 2001 in the [[Bi-Lo Center]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. The tour officially began on 8 June 2001 in the [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida]]. The highlight of the tour was Michael Flatley performing for the first time in [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City on 29 June 2001. The tour ended on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas, Texas]] in the [[American Airlines Center]], the second event to be held at the venue. The last time the show was performed was 29 July 2001. Michael Flatley was said to have retired that night{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but later in 2005 would come out with a new show, [[Celtic Tiger Live|Celtic Tiger]].

===2008 and 2009 Tour===
"Feet of Flames" returned to the world stage for a brief period with lead dancers Damien O' Kane and Bernadette Flynn taking the lead. This would mark the first time in the show's history that Michael Flatley would not be starring or dancing in it. This show featured dances/costumes from 1998 Hyde Park show. Later in 2009 Flatley returned in the lead role.

===2009===
In 2009, Michael Flatley reprised his role in the 2009 tour held in the [[Taipei Arena]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan. It was filmed for DVD and later released as noted in his website. It was also released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk by Playback HD in 2010. The 2009 return of Michael Flatley would later mark his return to his show, Lord of the Dance in 2010. 

==CD, VHS and DVD releases==
[[File:Flatley alone cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Flatley as Lord of the Dance during his return]]
The "Feet of Flames" show from Hyde Park in 1998 was released on VHS and DVD. A CD of the new music from the Hyde park show was released with the DVD. The Budapest show in 2000 was recorded for DVD release but this did not happen; however, clips of the show were put on Michael Flatley's autobiography/concert DVD ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. Included on the DVD are the numbers:

*The Court of High Kings
*Firedance
*Cleopatra's Spell
*Thunder and Lightning
*Stolen Kiss
*The Duel
*Victory March/Victory Dance
*Feet of Flames solo

The [[Madison Square Garden]] show on 29 June 2001 in New York City and the American Airlines Center show on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas]], Texas, were recorded. The American leg of the tour was filmed for an [[IMAX]] planned for release in 2002. In addition parts of the footage were going to be used in a film featuring Michael Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The working title for the film was supposedly "Dream Dancer", a fictional love story.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Clips of the rehearsal process for the movie can be found on ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. The film was, however, never completed. The original film from the shows in allegedly tied up in ownership dispute between the filming company and Michael Flatley's company [[Unicorn Entertainment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The 2009 Taiwan tour was filmed for an actual DVD release and later released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in 2010

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">[[Image:Tatham.jpg|thumb|250px|''Portrait of William Williams'' (c 1828) by Tatham, imitating the style of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]]]

'''Frederick Tatham''' (31 July 1805 — 29 July 1878) was an English artist who was a member of the [[ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]], a group of followers of [[William Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saxonlodge.net/getperson.php?personID=I0840&amp;tree=Tatham Frederick Tatham at ''SaxonLodge'' entry for Tatham family history (The Tathams of County Durham)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of [[Charles Heathcote Tatham]], an architect, Tatham and his brother and sister were all associated with the Ancients. His sister Julia married another member, [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], the father of [[William Blake Richmond]].&lt;ref name=DNB00/&gt;

Tatham is most notable because after Blake's death, he looked after the poet's widow [[Catherine Blake (wife of William Blake)|Catherine]], who nominally worked as his housekeeper. After her death in 1831, he claimed that she had left him all her husband’s works. This claim brought him into conflict with another Ancient, [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], who insisted that Blake's sister should have inherited them. Tatham also tried to extract paintings that Linnell himself owned, though Linnell had bought them from the artist.

Shortly afterwards, Tatham joined a [[millenarian]] sect, becoming an [[Irvingite]] (follower of [[Edward Irving]]). At this time his religious dogmatism led him to destroy a significant number of Blake's works in the belief that they had been inspired by the devil. Tatham later wrote biographical literature on Blake.

Tatham was both a sculptor and painter, exhibiting at the [[Royal Academy]] between 1825 and 1854.&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle = Tatham, Charles Heathcote|first =  Thomas Knyvett|last =Richmond|authorlink = Thomas Knyvett Richmond|volume = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works were characterised by their imitation of stiff early Renaissance styles, in the manner of the Ancients, though his later work became more conventional.

Frederick Tatham died two days before his 73rd birthday in his home at 45&amp;nbsp;Oak Village in the [[Kentish Town]] area of [[North London|Northwest London]].

'''Georgine''' is a women’s [[ready-to-wear]] brand founded by the designers Georgine Ratelband and Chris Roshia in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Designer to Watch: GEORGINE’s Georgine Ratelband|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/318363-simply-chic-simply-georgine/#/slide/1|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=theFashionSpot|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suitcasemag"/&gt;

== History ==
Georgine was launched by the fashion designer Georgine Ratelband with her partner Chris Roshia and was founded in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Georgine Ratelband and Chris Roshia - SCAD.edu|url=https://www.scad.edu/content/georgine-ratelband-and-chris-roshia|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=[[Savannah College of Art and Design]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before completing her graduation from [[Istituto Europeo di Design]] in 2011, thesis-collection of Georgine was acquired by a boutique in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"/&gt; Georgine was presented at [[New York Fashion Week]], and their designs have rated the pages of [[Women’s Wear Daily]], [[W Magazine]] and [[Vogue Italia]].&lt;ref name="suitcasemag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=PWhat’s in Your Suitcase, Georgine Ratelband|url=https://suitcasemag.com/fashion/global-style/whats-in-your-suitcase-georgine-ratelband/|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=[[Suitcase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11520">'''Guccio di Mannaia''' (Malnaia; Malnaggia; Manaie; Mannaie) was an Italian goldsmith from Siena, Italy active from 1288 to 1322. He is best known for a 13th-century decorated gold-plated chalice which contains the first documented use of translucent enamels using the technique known as [[basse-taille]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA93&amp;lpg=RA2-PA93&amp;dq=guccio+di+mannaia+basse-taille&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zZU3IV-gab&amp;sig=KUq_QEyw7dZuHOcXfIsyGz4qjNE&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture|last=Hourihane|first=Colum|date=2012-12-06|publisher=OUP USA|year=|isbn=9780195395365|volume=1|location=|pages=93|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pCQ4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=%22Guccio+di+Mannaia%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ueEkZcDwo&amp;sig=kDYEBE8qiW7ixWqEwu2ijQZhGpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9hNHD1Z7RAhUHDsAKHY2rADcQ6AEIygIwMQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Guccio%20di%20Mannaia%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Splendori Di Assisi.

== Biographical details ==
Little is known about the life of Guccio di Mannaia, and very few works are attributed to him with certainty. He came from a family of [[Siena|Sienese]] [[goldsmith]]s, with his brother (Pino) as well as his three sons (Montigiano, Mannaia, and Jacopo) working in the same trade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was influenced by [[Pace di Valentino]] who was the first Sienese goldsmith working for the [[Papal household|papal court]] (under popes Nicholas III, Martin IV, Honorius IV, and Boniface VIII).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pace-di-valentino_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=PACE di Valentino in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he seems to have been familiar with northern European artworks, such as the [[Westminster Retable|Westminster retable]] in England and the miniatures in [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Parisian [[Master Honoré]], to which the human figures in his work are often compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=3_FGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=westminster+retable+guccio+di+mannaia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_FY6fNDjgm&amp;sig=4K2XMW9PUfBk8TRKbYAzOMb_LbA&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOkLb_n7rRAhVacFAKHdabC9oQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=westminster%20retable%20guccio%20di%20mannaia&amp;f=false|title=Duccio: Siena fra tradizione bizantina e mondo gotico|last=Bagnoli|first=Alessandro|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Silvana|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=448–453|language=it|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/guccio-di-mannaia_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=GUCCIO di Mannaia in "Dizionario Biografico"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=|language=Italian|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=y_DzBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=westminster+retable+guccio+di+mannaia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LrmsaMdAFp&amp;sig=whExdtf9CbycjgthZvWCyQvSfeI&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOkLb_n7rRAhVacFAKHdabC9oQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=westminster%20retable%20guccio%20di%20mannaia&amp;f=false|title=Il Pittore Oltremontano di Assisi: Il Gotico a Siena e la formazione di Simone Martini|last=Aa.Vv|first=|date=2012-03-17|publisher=Gangemi Editore spa|year=|isbn=9788849255997|location=|pages=14|language=it|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that he was actively working until 1322 though he was dead by 1329.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Calice di Guccio di Mannaia|last=Cioni|first=Elisabetta|publisher=Edizioni Musei Vaticani|year=2014|isbn=9788882713300|editor-last=Callori di Vignale|editor-first=Flavia|location=Città del Vaticano|pages=51–52|language=Italian|chapter=Guccio di Mannaia e l'oreficeria senese del XIIII secolo|quote=|editor-last2=Santamaria|editor-first2=Ulderico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chalice of Nicholas IV ==
Guccio di Mannaia's only signed work is a [[chalice]] "of extraordinary importance and quality"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; made in 1288-1292 at the request of [[Nicolas IV|Pope Nicholas IV]] for the [[Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi]]. The base and [[wikt:knop|knop]] were made of gold-plated silver using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]], while the cup, made of the same material, was created through [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]]. It contains technical details including finely wrought [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] leaves with other metalwork features that mark it as "Tuscan Gothic";&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; both its form and technique were widely copied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, the chalice is decorated with ninety-six translucent and semi-translucent [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Tesoro della Basilica di San Francesco ad Assisi|last=Liscia Bemporad|first=Dora|publisher=Editrice Francescana|year=1980|isbn=|editor-last=Ciardi Dupré dal Poggetto|editor-first=Maria G.|location=Assisi|pages=125|chapter=Oreficerie e Avorio|quote="Few works of art ... achieve such a level of consistency among formal, decorative, iconographic and functional elements. / Poche opere d'arte ... raggiungono una tale coerenza tra l'elemento formale, decorativo, iconografico e funzionale."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enamels depict images of the crucifixion, the Virgin and child, symbols of the evangelists, several Franciscan saints (Saints Francis, Clare, and Anthony), Pope Nicholas himself, as well as angels, apostles, and prophets. The range of enamel colors includes azure, violet, yellow-gold, green, brown, and blue, and in various places the chiselling and engraving of the metalwork reveals the silver underneath the gold plating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Calice di Guccio di Mannaia|last=De Chirico|first=Fabio|publisher=Edizioni Musei Vaticani|year=2014|isbn=9788882713300|editor-last=Callori di Vignale|editor-first=Flavia|location=Città del Vaticano|pages=11|language=Italian|chapter=Introduzione|quote=|editor-last2=Santamaria|editor-first2=Ulderico}}&lt;/ref&gt; His signature (''Guccius Mannaie de Senis fecit'') as well as the name of the commissioning Pope (''Niccholaus Papa quartus'') are contained in sixteen of the enamels that circumscribe the chalice’s stem. Commissioned by the first Franciscan pope, the chalice with its imagery is part of the vast decorative project that includes the [[fresco]]es and [[Stained glass|stained glass windows]] of the Basilica. An inventory from 1430 of the Basilica, where the chalice is still kept, contains a reference to a [[paten]], now lost, that was decorated with a scene of the Last Supper, similar in style to the chalice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other works attributed to him are done so based only on comparison to the chalice rather than other documentary evidence, and can be found in museums in Florence, Siena, Paris, and Berlin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=i3Od9bcGus0C&amp;pg=PA457&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;dq=works+attributed+to+Guccio+di+Mannaia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wkydSvKgYU&amp;sig=d3tcnZhAxdtY8OCFQPWhZpvAn4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitxPnE3J7RAhXmLsAKHUHEAMkQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=works%20attributed%20to%20Guccio%20di%20Mannaia&amp;f=false|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195189483|volume=1|location=|pages=457|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic legacy ==
Guccio di Mannaia's work would influence many other goldsmiths of the era, and his chalice would become a "fundamental model for the production of chalices in the decades to come."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Tondino di Guerrino]], another goldsmith from Siena, most likely studied under him as an apprentice. An image from one of Guccio's seals, that of the rulers of Siena known as the ''Signori Nove'',&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; was reproduced by [[Simone Martini]] in his grand [[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maesta]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a fresco that covers an entire wall in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|Palazzo Pubblico of Siena]]. Other imagery from this same seal, specifically the orb held by the Madonna and child, can be found also in the gilded-glass panel of a wooden reliquary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.kenyon.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=perejournal|title=A Framework for Devotion in Trecento Siena: a Reliquary Frame in the Cleveland Museum of Art|last=Brilliant|first=Virginia|date=2014|website=|publisher=Peregrinations: Journal of Medieval Art and Architecture (Vol 4, Issue 3)|pages=75–76|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from about 1347. The gilded glass panel is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, while the wooden frame is in the Cleveland Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/explorer/index.php?qu=gilded%20glass&amp;oid=28233|title=Collections Explorer - Object Detail (M.56 &amp; A-1904, id:2)|last=UK.|first=The Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge,|date=2012-01-01|website=webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk|publisher=|language=EN-GB|access-date=2017-01-19|note=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his work would anticipate that of [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] and [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Tesoro della Basilica di San Francesco ad Assisi|last=Liscia Bemporad|first=Dora|publisher=Editrice Francescana|year=1980|isbn=|editor-last=Ciardi Dupré dal Poggetto|editor-first=Maria G.|location=Assisi|pages=125|chapter=Oreficerie e Avorio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookshop was established on [[St. Olaf]]s day on 29 July 1865 by [[bookbinder]] '''Hans Nicolai Jacobsen'''. He was the father of [[Jakob Jakobsen]] (1864-1918), who is one of the most important Faroese [[philologist]]s.

H. N. Jacobsen was one of the initiators of a public meeting in [[Tórshavn]] in 1888, aiming at public support for “the protection and preservation of the [[Faroese language]] and [[tradition]]s”, as the notice announcing the meeting said. This is considered as the official start of the Faroese National Movement.

The original book shop was in the old main street "Gongin", but 1918 it was moved to the Market Square "Vaglið", at the start of Niels Finsens gøta, where it still stands today.

With its characteristic Faroese grass roof and big [[maple trees]] in the foreground, it is a [[landmark]] in Tórshavn.  
In addition, a section of H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil operates an antiquarian bookshop.

The [[Hugo Award]]s are presented every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The award has been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitroHugo"/&gt; The '''Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist''' is given each year for artists of works related to science fiction or fantasy which appeared in low- or non-paying publications such as [[semiprozine]]s or [[fanzine]]s. A [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Hugo Award for professional artists]] is also given. The fan award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually. Beginning in 1996, Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954, although only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received sufficient nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt;

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are those six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]] and in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

[[File:BradFoster.jpg|right|thumb|[[Brad W. Foster]] has received the largest number of awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations.]]
During the 54 nomination years, 70 artists have been nominated; 28 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. [[Brad W. Foster]] has received the largest number of awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations. [[William Rotsler]] and [[Tim Kirk]] have won five awards, from twenty-three and eight nominations respectively. The only other artists to win more than twice are [[Teddy Harvia]], with four out of twenty nominations, [[Alexis A. Gilliland]], with four out of eight, and [[Frank Wu (artist)|Frank Wu]], also with four out of eight.

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the [[54th World Science Fiction Convention|1996 Worldcon]], the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of "Retro Hugos", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Retro Hugos have been awarded six times, for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt; Only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received enough nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.&lt;ref name="Hugo39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;

[[Image:Diptych Barberini Louvre OA9063 whole.jpg|thumb|left|Barberini Ivory on display at the [[Louvre]].]]
[[Image:Ivory Ariadne Bargello.jpg|thumb|Panel of a possible imperial diptych representing the empress [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], [[Bargello]].]]
In [[Late Antiquity]], an '''imperial diptych''' is a theoretical type of [[ivory]] [[diptych]], made up of two leaves of five panels each and each with a central panel representing the emperor or empress.  They are so-named in contrast to [[consular diptych]]s.  They were produced as unique examples, whereas each consular diptych was produced in large numbers to offer to the emperor on certain occasions, principally a nobleman's entry to the consulship.

No complete example of an imperial diptych survives and so their existence is contested.  The ivories specialist R. Delbrück has theorised that the 19 surviving fragments of ivory panels which clearly do not belong to the usual type of consular diptychs constitute evidence of imperial diptychs, despite having many characteristics in common with consular diptychs.  The iconography of these diptychs  obeys a stereotypical scheme, as illustrated by the [[Barberini ivory]], which is the best example of the posited type - an imperial diptych's programme would be made up of a central figure of the emperor or empress, figures of dignitaries on its side panels, an upper register showing a personification of Constantinople or a medallion with a bust of Christ and a lower register showing barbarians making offerings to the emperor.  However, the fact that the Barberini ivory was almost certainly not a diptych, but some kind of imperial [[icon]] without a second panel is a serious argument against the existence of the imperial diptych type.

The two panels representing the empress [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], in the [[Bargello]] in [[Florence]] and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]], also belong to the hypothesied imperial diptych type.  They are the only central panels of such a diptych (other than the Barberini ivory) to survive, since all other fragments of such diptychs are from side panels.

It is a subsidiary of [[Ingram Industries]].&lt;ref name="urlIngram Industries - Company Description - Hoovers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/ingram-industries/--ID__40233--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title=Ingram Industries - Company Description - Hoover's |work= |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's daily activities are handled by Shawn Morin who serves as CEO.  [[John R. Ingram (businessman)|John R. Ingram]] serves as chairman of Ingram Content Group. He also serves as the Vice Chairman of [[Ingram Industries]].

Ingram Content Group’s operating units are Ingram Book Company, Ingram International Inc., Ingram Library Services Inc., Ingram Publisher Services Inc., Ingram Periodicals Inc., Ingram Digital, Lightning Source Inc., Spring Arbor Distributors Inc., and Tennessee Book Company LLC.

During 1999 and 2000, Ingram Industries negotiated a sale to Barnes &amp; Noble which was ultimately withdrawn after pressure from [[independent bookstore]]s and the American Booksellers Association.

In June 2014, the company in conjunction with [[Hachette Book Group USA]], and [[Perseus Books Group]], announced a three-way deal whereby Hachette would buy Perseus and then sell that company's client services businesses to Ingram. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="HachettePerseus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perseus Books Group being acquired by Hachette|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63029-hbg-buying-perseus-ingram-to-get-distribution-biz.html|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=''Publishers Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2016, John Ingram stepped down as CEO, being replaced by Shawn Morin.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Morin Named CEO and President of Ingram Content Group Inc. http://www.ingramcontent.com/news/shawn-morin-named-ceo-and-president-of-ingram-content-group-inc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The company has the industry's largest active book inventory with access to 7.5 million titles. The markets they serve include booksellers, librarians, educators and specialty retailers. Ingram employs approximately 3,000 people worldwide.

Ingram Content Group is used heavily throughout the United States as a major distributor for independent book stores. Ingram has warehouses in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Indiana. They also operate a print on demand business under the [[Lightning Source]] brand with facilities in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, United Kingdom, France and Australia. The company also provides full service distribution including sales and marketing services via its Ingram Publisher Services division.

In addition to print distribution, Ingram also provides digital content services and distribution through CoreSource, [https://www.vitalsource.com VitalSource], and MyiLibrary.

In 2015, Ingram purchased Aer.io which allows websites, in USA only, to sell books from the Ingram catalog.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In June 2017, Ingram purchased Book Network International Limited, a book distributor based in [[Plymouth]], U.K., from [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]&lt;ref name="nashbusinessjournalingrambuysbritish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Eric|title=Ingram buys British distributor|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2017/06/30/ingram-buys-british-distributor.html|accessdate=August 11, 2017|work=Nashville Business Journal|date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">The '''Integrated Circuit Topography Act''' ("An Act to provide for the protection of integrated circuit topographies and to amend certain Acts in consequence thereof", C-37) is legislation passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1990 that regulates the [[intellectual property]] of [[mask work|integrated circuit topographies]]. It came into force in 1993. The Act provides [[exclusive right]]s for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.

Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or '''IC products''' that are configured and interconnected. These creations are protected in Canada by the Integrated Circuit Topography Act, which gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of ten years after registration. Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7950">'''Julia Kwan''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[screenwriter]], director, and occasional producer of her own short and feature films.  She has brought a keen sense of the Chinese-Canadian cultural experience to her films.  Several of the films were made in conjunction with the [[National Film Board of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;"Julia Kwan - NFB." National Film Board of Canada. Accessed October 23, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nfb.ca/explore-all-directors/julia-kwan/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her feature films include ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005), as well as the feature length [[Documentary film]] ''[[Everything Will Be]]'' (2014).  She is also known for her short film ''10,000 Delusions'' (1999) which screened at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Julia Kwan was raised in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] to [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant parents. These childhood experiences would be a strong influence on her feature film [[Eve and the Fire Horse|''Eve and'' ''the Fire Horse'' (2005)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Walker, Susan. "Canada's Sundance kid; Julia Kwan's film is festival's lone Canadian entry Story focuses on Chinese life in Vancouver." ''Toronto Star'', January 27, 2006. Accessed October 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother was a garment factory worker,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; while her father was employed as the head waiter at a Vancouver Chinese restaurant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She studied film at [[Ryerson Polytechnic University]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Eisner, Ken. "VIFF 2014: Julia Kwan’s Everything Will Be Captures Vancouver’s Chinatown in Transition | Georgia Straight Vancouver's News &amp; Entertainment Weekly." Georgia Straight Vancouver's News &amp; Entertainment Weekly. Last modified September 24, 2014. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.straight.com/movies/734976/viff-2014-julia-kwans-everything-will-be-captures-vancouvers-chinatown-transition&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kwan was previously employed as a data entry clerk, and is capable of typing 105 words a minute.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Montagu, Katharine. "Eve and the Horse writer-director may be quiet, but Julia Kwan has plenty of bite." ''Canadian Screenwriter'' 9, no. 1 (October 2006), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, Kwan is in remission from [[Cancer]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Leiren-Young, Mark. "Julia Kwan rediscovers Chinatown; Debut documentary Everything Will Be reflects her love for the community of her childhood." ''Vancouver Sun'', September 25, 2014, D.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kwan was born under the Chinese [[astrological sign]] of the Fire Horse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Kwan did not start making films until her 20s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
Julia Kwan was a director resident at [[Norman Jewison]]'s [[Canadian Film Centre]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Holt, Jim. "Vancouver director Julia Kwan gets warm reception at snowy Sundance." ''Canadian Press Newswire'', January 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  After beginning her career writing and directing two short films, she made her feature ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005).  The film was well received, with [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] declaring it "a finely wrought period piece" and "an exceptional feature debut.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Ken. "Eve &amp; The Fire Horse." ''Variety Magazine'', October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;"   Forty percent of the dialogue in ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005) is spoken in Kwan's native tongue&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Brendan. "The great wide north: Canadian filmmakers broaden their cinema's scope to tackle international issues." ''Variety Magazine'', September 12, 2005. Accessed November 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cantonese]].  The film deals with the issues that arise from the friction between traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs and those of [[Catholicism]] for nine year old Eve (Phoebe Kut) growing up in Vancouver.  The actress has appeared in three of Kwan's films.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The film is "a largely autobiographical tale (of Kwan herself) growing up as a child of immigrants in Vancouver".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She has worked in a diversity of both subjects and genres throughout her filmography. Her short film ''Surfacing'' (2015) had Canadian folk musician [[Sarah McLachlan]] for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;"Surfacing by Julia Kwan - NFB." National Film Board of Canada. Accessed October 24, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nfb.ca/film/surfacing/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the film, McLachlan tells anecdotes from both her childhood and professional career, in first person narration.   Kwan also made a foray into animation with her short film ''Blossom''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (2010).  This short [[Experimental film|experimental]] film showcases the changing of the seasons, as compared with the growth cycle of a child.   Kwan's feature film ''[[Everything Will Be]]'' (2014) was her exploration of the effects of [[gentrification]] in [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver Chinatown]].  In the film, she interviews neighbourhood occupants that represent both the past and the future of the rapidly gentrifying community.  The title of the film was inspired by an artistic installation by [[Martin Creed]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   As of late 2006, Kwan was writing a treatment of [[Douglas Coupland]]'s classic novel [[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture|Generation X]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''L'Ymagier''''', subtitled "A Magazine of Engravings", was a French [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] art magazine edited by [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Remy de Gourmont]] between 1894 and 1895. It ran for five issues and disbanded one year after its first printing, but in that time it published many prints and engravings by influential artists of the time, including [[Henri Rousseau]].

== Beginnings ==
Jarry, a French playwright and artist, and Gourmont, a novelist and poet of the same nationality, had worked in woodcuttings for many years before they joined together to form the magazine, although both men were so poor at times that they were forced to experiment with other mediums, such as [[linoleum]] and soap for their cuttings. Jarry had also been fascinated with the editorial aspects of publication since he, Francois Coulon and Louis Lormel had collaborated on ''L’Art Litteraire'' in 1893–94, which Jarry contributed to and Lormel edited. Jarry and Gourmont founded their own magazine in 1894 with a modest fortune, thus giving them a venue through which they would have complete artistic control over the expression and presentation of both their art and their interests.

=== Symbolism ===

Jarry wrote in ''L’Ymagier'' of the power of the direct and [[archetype|archetypal]] symbol, and set about comparing those symbols, such as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] to the deliberately primitive pieces of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], as well as many of his own works. The theme of the universal, primitive, and often childish forces at work in art and society was one that both Jarry and Gourmont would revisit often in their own writing and artwork, particularly in Jarry’s most famous play "[[Ubu Roi]]." The two also attempted to impress in their magazine the rejection of an optical reality, and instead tried to return art to a place of cult and ritual, hence the heavy religious imagery which peppered several of the issues.

== Publication ==
The first issue was published in October 1894, and was entitled "The Passion" as it contained many woodcuttings depicting the Passion of [[Christ]]. It was filled with elaborate and striking religious imagery, yet it was followed shortly by the shockingly graphic and unusual issue "Monsters" in January 1895. Following that was an issue in April 1895 entitled "The Virgin and [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]]" and then a revisiting of "The Passion" in July of the same year. The final issue, published in October 1895 was the most sparse of all. It was entitled "[[Gingerbread man|Gingerbread Figures]]" and contained only five pictures, four published under the name Alain Jans, Jarry’s nom-de-plume, and one which was unsigned. Shortly after this issue Jarry and Gourmont separated and the magazine quietly died out.

=== Contributors ===
Aside from Jarry and Gourmont, ''L'Ymagier'' published engravings from Gauguin, Bernard, Francois Georgin, a renowned woodcutter of the day, and Henri Rousseau who developed the status of cult artist due to his work in the magazine and was consistently one of its most popular contributors.

== Afterwards ==
Following his father’s death in 1895 Jarry used his inheritance to found ''Perhinderion'', a journal whose title is a [[Breton language|Breton]] word for [[pilgrimage]]. The journal was dedicated to juxtaposing conflicting elements often seen separately in art, such as intellectuality and naiveté, as well as presenting the complete works of [[Albrecht Dürer]], a 15th-century painter and printmaker from Germany. Special attention was paid to Dürer’s ''[[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]'' which is highly symbolist in the way it moves between the formal and the hallucinatory. Jarry declared in the first issue of ''Perhinderion'' that the reproductions of the woodcuts would be [[photoengraving|photoengraved]]&amp;nbsp;... without reducing their size, and struck&amp;nbsp;... on [[laid paper]], which is the most similar to the original paper." This, along with the lavish format, led production costs to be so high that publication was discontinued after only two issues.
Though short lived, Jarry and Gourmont’s work in ''L’Ymagier'' and the magazine’s highly symbolist style influenced many artists and writers of the early 20th century, notably [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Max Jacob]], who would build on Jarry and Gourmont’s work in symbolism through [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]]ism in the 1900s.

'''Miquela Sousa''', better known as '''Lil Miquela''', is a fictional character created by [[Yung Skeeter|Trevor McFedries]] and Sara Decou as a digital art project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/brud.fyi/|title=Brud (@brud.fyi) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7964899/virtual-instagram-miquela-controversy-interview|title=Virtual It-Singer Miquela Says 'Controversy Doesn't Mean Anything': Interview|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Highsnobiety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorsler|first1=Fabian|title=Meet Lil Miquela: Fashion’s First Virtual Instagram Influencer|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-virtual-influencer-instagram/?format=amp|website=Highsnobiety|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPEBEAST"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Isaac|title=Miquela Sousa Is Fashion's First Computer Generated Influencer|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/miquela-sousa-first-computer-generated-fashion-influencer?amp=1|website=HYPEBEAST|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Samantha|title=This Instagram Influencer Is Not Even Human|url=http://footwearnews.com/2018/influencers/technology/miquela-sousa-instagram-virtual-influencer-491637/amp/|website=FN|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miquela is an [[Instagram]] model and music artist claiming to be from [[Downey, California]].

The project began in 2016 as an [[Instagram]] profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lilmiquela-instagram_uk_57c94056e4b085cf1ecdc0af|title=Instagram's Latest 'It' Model Is Confusing The Hell Out Of Everyone|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also details a fictional narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and Decou.

In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7898117/miquela-virtual-singer-instagram-not-mine-song-stream|title=Virtual Singer &amp; Internet Star Miquela Shares Debut Single 'Not Mine'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pivot into a music has been compared to virtual musicians [[Gorillaz]] and [[Hatsune Miku]].&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Origins==
Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick for ''[[The Sims]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Online presence==
Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including [[Diplo]], [[How to Dress Well]], killerandasweetthang founder Eileen Kelly, [[Molly Soda]], [[Nile Rogers]], and [[Samantha Urbani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/|title=*~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and BBC.com.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a [https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI phone interview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shane|title=CONSPIRACY THEORIES &amp; INTERVIEW WITH LIL MIQUELA|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She appeared on the cover of High Snobiety in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-cover-story-issue-16/|title=Meet Lil Miquela, the AI Influencer on the Cover of Our New Print Issue|website=High Snobiety|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Miquela did an Instagram takeover for Prada as part of Milan Fashion Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/prada-instagram-gifs-lil-miquela|title=Prada Launches Instagram GIFs With Help From a Fictional It Girl|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online narratives===
In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving [https://www.instagram.com/blawko22 @Blawko22], and [https://www.instagram.com/bermudaisbae/ @BermudaIsBae], two other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhuruzXHetm/?taken-by=bermudaisbae|title=Bermuda on Instagram: "More emotional than I thought it would be. Despite it all, there’s only three of us out there and we need to stick together. We talked it…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkjEPEuFdp0/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So I pull up to the trail and there she is. No rattlesnakes. No hiking. Just a robot sitting on the curb in skinny jeans and wedges.  She said it’s the only way she could get my attention since I haven’t answered her texts since we went to the mall a couple weeks back.  She just wanted to hang out.  So here we are 'hanging out.'"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BjvhTbylRcD/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So, Brud programmed my memories, claiming I’m from a place called Downey.  It’s right in-between Los Angeles and Disneyland.  Even though that sounds like a dream to me, I had to come check it out for myself..."|website=Instagram|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Miquela has released several singles since her debut with "Not Mine," including "You Should be Alone," "Over You," and a collaboration with [[Baauer]] titled "Hate Me." Her musical style is characterized by the use of [[auto-tune]] and [[trap music|trap]]-influenced production. Her music has been released on [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]]. Miquela's sound is purportedly based off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, [[Evil Dead]].

==Uses==
Many of the designs that are used contain symbological and religious significance to the Ojibwa. Though the practice almost died out, there are an estimated dozen practitioners left in Canada and the United States, some of whom display the craft in contexts outside of their original intentions to show evidence of this ancient practice. Birch bark bitings can be used in storytelling, as patterns for [[quillwork]] and [[beadwork]], as well as finished pieces of art.&lt;ref name="YoungbergHolmlund2003"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XhHUzUwJtA4C&amp;pg=PA250 Inspiring Women: A Celebration of Herstory]''.

The '''National Society of Mural Painters''' ('''NSMP''') is an American artists' organization originally known as '''The Mural Painters'''. The charter of the society is to advance the techniques and standards for the design and execution of mural art for the enrichment of architecture in the United States.    

==Background==
The NSMP was founded in 1895, in an era of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] in America, a time when public architecture was integrated with murals, sculpture, mosaics and other artwork, coordinated and themed to assert the identity of the building.  Parallel organizations associated with the same principles of integrated public art include the [[National Sculpture Society]], which originally included a large percentage of architectural sculptors, and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]], founded in 1916 as the teaching wing of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects.

Still in existence after more than a hundred years, the society presents exhibitions and organizes competitions.  The NSMP is a member of the Fine Arts Federation of New York.

== Past presidents of the Society include ==

'''Ned Kahn''' is an environmental artist and sculptor, famous in particular for museum exhibits he has built for the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].   His works usually involves capturing an invisible aspect of nature and making it visible; examples include building facades that move in waves in response to wind; indoor tornadoes and vortices made of fog, steam, or fire; a transparent sphere containing water and sand which, when spun, erodes a beach-like ripple pattern into the sand surface. In 2003 Kahn collaborated with [[Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc.]] on a piece for the [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]] consisting of hundreds of movable flaps that respond to the wind creating visible patterns.  Kahn  won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation]] "[[genius grant]]" fellowship in 2003, and the [[National Design Award]] for environmental design in 2005. His work is in the collection of di Rosa, Napa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dirosaart.org/collection-in-focus-ned-kahn/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahn lives and works in California.

'''''Niagara Falls, from the American Side''''' is a painting by the American artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]] (1826–1900). Completed in 1867, it is based on preliminary sketches made by the artist at [[Niagara Falls]] and on a sepia photograph. It is Church's largest painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Voyage of the Icebergs: Frederic Church's Arctic Masterpiece |last=Harvey |first=Eleanor Jones |last2=Church |first2=Frederic Edwin |date=2002 |publisher=Dallas Museum of Art |isbn=9780300095364 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is now in the collection of the [[Scottish National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=natgall&gt;{{cite web|title=Niagara Falls, from the American side|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/c/artist/frederic-edwin-church/object/niagara-falls-from-the-american-side-ng-799|website=nationalgalleries.org|publisher=National Galleries Scotland|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church was a leading member of the [[Hudson River School]] of painters.&lt;ref name=craven&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craven|first1=Wayne|title=American art: history and culture|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0071415246|pages=207–209|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The painting depicts the view from the east side of Niagara Falls&amp;nbsp;– the American side. In the spray of the waterfall a rainbow is visible. The painting has been described as giving the impression of the water being in constant motion, rushing down, roaring.&lt;ref&gt;[Linda Lee Revie The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists and Writers at the Falls. — Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2003. — 212 с. — {{ISBN|978-0-889-20433-1}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/great-works-niagara-falls-from-the-american-side-1867-260cm-x-231cm-frederic-edwin-church-7545593.html|title=Great Works: Niagara Falls, from the American Side, 1867 (260cm x 231cm), Frederic Edwin Church|work=The Independent|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Niagara by Frederic Edwin Church, 1857 - Corcoran Gallery of Art - DSC01135.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Niagara (Frederic Edwin Church)|Niagara]]'', 1857. Oil on canvas, 102 × 230 cm. [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Corcoran collection]], [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington]]]]

Church made [[Niagara (Frederic Edwin Church)|his first painting]] of the falls in 1857. He had visited the falls several times in July and late August the previous year, making a number of pencil and oil [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] from different points of view. He elected to paint the scene from the Canadian side, choosing unconventional dimensions for the painting that emphasized the panoramic effect.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niagara|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.166436.html|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This first painting was an immediate success, attracting over 100,000 visitors within the first fortnight of its premiere at a New York gallery. Following this, it was exhibited at major cities on the Eastern seaboard, toured Britain twice and was selected for the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Exposition Universelle]] in Paris. It was purchased by the recently founded [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in 1876, cementing that institution's success. When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was gifted to the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt;

''Niagara Falls, from the American Side'' was commissioned from Church by the American art dealer Michael Knoedler in 1866. It was the third painting of the series and may have been originally destined for the Exposition. Like many of Church's works of the 1850s and 1860s, it was exhibited in New York City, and then sent to London, where a [[chromolithograph]] was made. In 1887 the painting was purchased by [[John S. Kennedy]], who gifted it to his homeland of Scotland.&lt;ref name=natgall/&gt; ''Niagara Falls, from the American Side'' is the only major work by Frederic Edwin Church which is in a public collection in Europe.&lt;ref name=natgall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/14815/Holmstead_american_0008N_10433display.pdf?sequence=1|title=Neither land nor water:Martin Jonson Heade, Frederic Edwin Church and American landscape painting in the nineteenth century |pp=23–26, 36–38, 40 |publisher=WRLC|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Study for "Under Niagara" Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumbnail|One of the studies of the Niagara falls]]

The canvas is painted in the [[Romantic style]] and captures the aesthetic principles of the sublime and the ''[[picturesque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/beautifulsublime.htm|title=The University of Chicago: beautiful, sublime|publisher=csmt.uchicago.edu|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church was a member of the [[Hudson River School]], a group of [[landscape painting|landscape]] artists, whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The Romantic movement validated intense emotions. The movement was placing new emphasis on the sentiments of visionary and transcendental experience. Emotions like [[Awe (emotion)|awe]]&amp;nbsp;– especially that which is experienced in confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– were now entirely new aesthetic categories, and very different from art styles of the same era&amp;nbsp;– the unemotional [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the calm, balanced [[Classicism]]&lt;ref&gt;[Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as a source of [[aesthetic]] experience.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/6378|title=American Sublime |publisher=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sublime (philosophy)|Sublime]] view of nature was as something of a large scale dramatic subject, an expression of the sublime&amp;nbsp;– defined by [[Edmund Burke]] as the strongest emotion that can be felt.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sublime: Landscape Painting in the United States 1820–1880 (exhibition in 2002)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/american-sublime-landscape-painting-united-states-1820-1880|website=tate.org.uk|publisher=Tate Press Office|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica article on Romanticism|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508675/Romanticism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=On the Sublime and Beautiful|url=http://www.bartleby.com/24/2/107.html|website=bartleby.com|publisher=Bartleby|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philistine Bichrome ware''' is an archaeological term coined by [[William F. Albright]] in 1924 which describes pottery production in a general region associated with the [[Philistine]] settlements during the [[Iron Age]] I period in ancient [[Canaan]] (ca. 1200 - 1000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Schreiber|title=The Cypro-Phoenician pottery of the Iron Age |id= (page [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ITEc8yuYu4C&amp;pg=PA204 204]) |accessdate= 2 May 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-12854-5 |page=xxi |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0ITEc8yuYu4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR21 |quote=The history of this cultural terminology begins early in the last century with [[John Myres|J. L. Myres]] and M. Ohnefalsch-Richters Catalogue of the Cyprus Museum of 1899. Myres defines the “Graeco-Phoenician Age" as stretching from the First Introduction of Iron, to the Ptolemaic Conquest of Cyprus in 295 B.C... so named, because throughout it Cyprus was the principal meeting-point of Greek colonists and traders from the West, and of Phoenicians from the East" (Myres &amp; Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, 21-22). This enormous span of time included Iron Age Black-on-Red ware as well as late Mycenaean-influenced Cypriot types (Myres &amp; Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, Pl. IV). In 1924, [[William F. Albright|Albright]] published his excavations at Tell el-Ful ([[Gibeah]]), where he describes “Cypro-Phoenician" pottery concurrent with Aegean Late Bronze Age types and preceding "Philistine" wares (Albright 1924, 16). Albright’s use of the term here appears to describe a general region of pottery production. He uses the same terminology in his subsequent [[Tell Beit Mirsim]] publication of 1932, but there he also distinguishes a “Cypro-Phoenician" form "of the Iron Age type" which he dates to the late century BC (Albright 1932, 54-55, 61). It is from this point it seems that the term “Cypro-Phoenician" for the Iron Age Black-on-Red ceramic particularly the small 'perfume' juglet, enters Palestinian archaeology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have sought to connect Philistine Bichrome ware with imported [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] pottery from [[Cyprus]], and local Canaanite monochrome ware.

==Classification==
Philistine Bichrome ware is believed to be the direct descendant of imported MYCIIIC:1b pottery (MYC = [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]]), which was manufactured in [[Cyprus]] and imported to ancient Canaan, and locally made MYCIIIC:1b or monochrome ware, which was manufactured at settlements in Canaan. 

MYCIIIC:1b or monochrome ware was found in high-distribution during the Iron IA period (1200 - 1140/30 BCE) at the Philistine settlements of [[Ashdod]] (Stratum XIIIb: Area G; in general, Stratum XIII: Area H) and [[Ekron]] (Tel Miqne: Stratum VII).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Amihai Mazar]], "The Emergence of Philistine Material Culture," ''IEJ'' 1985 35:95-107; and [[Israel Finkelstein]], "The Philistine Settlement: When, Where and How Many," Pp. 159-180 in E, Oren, (ed).

Mazar. ''Archaeology of the Land of the Bible: 10,000 - 586 BCE'', Doubleday: New York, 1992, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron analysis==
Neutron analysis of Philistine Bichrome ware has found that it may have been made in the same workshop, locally in Canaan, as its predecessor, MYCIIIC:1b.&lt;ref name="Philistine Bichrome Ware"&gt;[http://www.neohumanism.org/p/po/pottery.html Philistine Bichrome Ware] [Accessed: April 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It first appears in the mid-12th Century BCE, during Iron IB (1140/30 - 1000/980 BCE) at sites such as Ashdod (Stratum XII), Megiddo (Stratum VIB). It was mainly confined to the Philistine settlements with some distribution throughout ancient Canaan.

==Style==
Stylistic features include the use of decoration with red and black paints (thus, bichrome) on a white slip with common Mycenaean motifs of birds, fish, and sailing vessels. While the shape of the pottery retains its Mycenaean roots, Cypriot influence is seen by the use of tall and narrow necks.&lt;ref name="Philistine Bichrome Ware"/&gt; Stylistic representations of birds in the Mycenaean style which are found on Bichrome ware were considered to be sacred and are also featured on the Philistine ships in the reliefs from [[Ramesses III]] ([[20th_Dynasty#Twentieth_Dynasty_timeline|20th Dynasty]]) mortuary temple at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (modern [[Luxor]]), [[Egypt]], which depicts his battle with the [[Sea Peoples]] in the eighth year of his reign known as the [[Battle of the Delta]] ca. 1175 BCE (the traditional date; alternative date of 1178 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;A. Mazar, ''Archaeology of the Land of the Bible: 10,000 - 586 BCE''. Doubleday: New York, 1992, pp. 313-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of pottery lasted until ca. 1000 BCE.

Philistine Bichrome ware is related to [[Cypriot Bichrome ware]]. 'Bichrome Red ware' from Cyprus is also relevant.

[[File:Louvre Grab.JPG|thumb|Life sized pleurants from the [[tomb of Philippe Pot]]]]
[[File:Tien pleurants.jpg|thumb|Pleurants of Isabella of Bourbon]]
'''Pleurants''' or '''weepers''' (the English meaning of ''pleurants'') are anonymous sculpted figures representing [[mourner|mourners]], used to decorate elaborate [[tomb monument]]s, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe.  Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this.  They may be in [[relief]] or free-standing.  In English usage the term "weepers" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the [[tomb effigy]] in Tudor tomb monuments. 

These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known.

In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for [[Margaret of Bourbon (1438–1483)|Margaret of Bourbon]] were not begun until 1526 at the earliest.  But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Burk, Jens Ludwig, "Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for [[Henry Marshal (bishop of Exeter)|Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter]] (d. 1206) in [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452–53. This has the effigy and weepers in [[gilt-bronze]], and still stands in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], with the "xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 207–209; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aKJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 the contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franco-Burgundian examples ==
On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles.  The tomb at [[Royaumont Abbey]] of [[Louis of France (1244–1260)]], son of [[Louis IX of France]], appears to have popularized the type.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Here a side of the chest below the effigy shows eight walking figures in relief in an arcade, led by two mitred clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Louiss1260.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the chest had a relief of the dead prince, covered by a cloth that leaves his face exposed being carried by four bearers.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Cortège des funérailles de Louis de France (1260).jpg|Image, now musée Carnavalet]]. Rather bizarrely, after the Revolution this panel was re-used for the "grave" of [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and [[Héloïse]] at [[Père Lachaise]] cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prix Versailles''' is an annual award dedicated to commercial architecture which was inaugurated in 2015. Discerned at the headquarters of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] in Paris, it encompasses several categories, with the winners being selected by an independent judges panel. It is the world architecture award for stores, hotels and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28fr%29_Prix_Versailles_21-04-2016.pdf {{fr}} Press release from 21 April 2016] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and process==
Following a call for submissions, this award singles out the architects and owners of shops and stores, hotels and restaurants around the world that are found to be particularly remarkable, from a perspective of their exterior architecture and their interior design. The prix focuses on commercial buildings, with the clear aim of fostering a better mix of the economic and cultural sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28en%29_Prix_Versailles_30-05-2016.pdf Press release from 30 May 2016] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irina Bokova]], Director-General of [[UNESCO]], declared on 19 June 2015, "The Prix Versailles is one of the ways to shine light on the intersection between creation, art and economics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28en%29_Prix_Versailles_22-06-2015.pdf Press release from 22 June 2015] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prix de Rome''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁi də ʁɔm|pron}}) or '''Grand Prix de Rome'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Grand orx}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French scholarship for arts students, initially for painters and sculptors, that was established in 1663 during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Winners were awarded a bursary that allowed them to stay in Rome for three to five years at the expense of the state. The prize was extended to architecture in 1720, music in 1803, and engraving in 1804. The prestigious award was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], the Minister of Culture.

==History==
The Prix de Rome was initially created for painters and sculptors in 1663 in France during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual [[bursary]] for promising artists having proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the ''[[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), was open to their students. From 1666, the award winner could win a stay of three to five years at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in Rome at the expense of the King of France. In 1720, the Académie Royale d’Architecture began a prize in architecture. Six painters, four sculptors, and two architects&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. "Prix de Rome", ''Grove Dictionary of Art online''&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to the [[French Academy in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] from 1666.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as two categories: painting and sculpture.  Architecture was added in 1720.  In 1803, music was added, and after 1804 there was a ''prix'' for engraving as well. The primary winner took the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Second Prizes" were awarded to the runners-up.

In 1803, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] moved the French Academy in Rome to the [[Villa Medici]] with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the [[French Revolution]]. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance.

[[Jacques-Louis David]], having failed to win the prize three years in a row, considered suicide. [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Ernest Chausson]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] attempted the Prix de Rome, but did not gain recognition.  Ravel tried a total of five times to win the prize, and the last failed attempt in 1905 was so controversial that it led to a complete reorganization of the administration at the [[Paris Conservatory]].

During World War II (1939–45) the prize winners were accommodated in the [[Villa Paradiso]] in Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://enligne.cg06.fr/jean-moulin/bottaro.html|last=Moulin|first=Jean|year=2014|publisher=Conseil général des Alpes-Maritimes|title=Nice, cité-refuge ?|accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], who was Minister of Culture at the time. Since then, a number of contests have been created, and the academies, together with the [[Institut de France]], were merged by the State and the Minister of Culture. Selected residents now have an opportunity for study during an 18-month (sometimes 2-year) stay at The Academy of France in Rome, which is accommodated in the Villa Medici.

The heyday of the Prix de Rome was during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; It was later imitated by the [[Abd-el-Tif prize|Prix Abd-el-Tif]] and the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]] in Algiers, 1907–1961, and later [[Prix d'Indochine]] including a bursary to visit the [[École des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] in [[Hanoi]], 1920–1939, and bursary for residence at the [[Casa de Velázquez]] in Madrid, 1929–present.

&lt;ref name=Foot1A&gt;Though sent to Rome in 1741.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot01&gt;"After the students present for the architecture competition left, only eight returned to make an ''esquisse'', but none were admitted to continue"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot2A&gt;Noted as Jollivet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot02&gt;Carried over from 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=Foot03&gt;From 1767 through 1772, the winners of the Prix de Rome were deprived of the usual scholarship that funded their trips to Rome; this occurred because of the vengeance exacted by [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]] in an enormous abuse of his power. Having quarreled with the Académie d'Architecture, Poisson de Vendières sent his personal manservants instead to Rome instead of the winners of the Grand Prix.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot04&gt;Carried over from 1771.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot05&gt;In 1773 the funding for the scholarship to Rome was reestablished for architects through the generosity of the Abbé Terray, successor of the Marquis de Marigny.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot06&gt;1775 was the last year that a third prize (Troisieme Prix) was awarded.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot07&gt;Carried over from 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot8A&gt;Fontaine would never win the Prix de Rome; however, a space at the Mancini Palace opened up in 1787 due to the delay in awarding the prize for that year, and Fontaine became the resident ''pensionnaire'', remaining in Rome until 1790.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot08&gt;Carried over from 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot9A&gt;"The projected entrants boycotted the contest by renouncing their status of students until the Académie adopted the changes they demanded in the old regulations.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot09&gt;From 1794–96 no competitions were held, since the Académies established by the Ancien Régime had been abolished by the Republican government. They were re-established by decree of 28 October 1796 under a new body known as the [[Institut de France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prix de Rome (Netherlands)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Netherlands)}}

A Prix de Rome was also established in the [[Kingdom of Holland]] by [[Louis Bonaparte|Lodewijk Napoleon]] to award young artists and architects. During the years 1807–1810 prize winners were sent to Paris and onwards to Rome for study. In 1817, after the [[Netherlands]] had gained its independence, [[William I of the Netherlands|King Willem I]] restarted the prize; though it took until 1823 before the new "Royal Academies" of Amsterdam and Antwerp could organize the juries. Suspended in 1851 it was reinstated in 1870 by [[William III of the Netherlands]]. Since then the winners have been selected by the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam under the main headings of architecture and the visual arts.

==Prix de Rome (Belgium)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Belgium)}}

The Belgian Prix de Rome (Dutch: Prijs van Rome) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French Prix de Rome. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the Grand Prix de Rome. There were distinct categories for architecture, painting, sculpture and music.

'''Santa Costanza''' is a 4th-century church in [[Rome]], Italy, on the [[Via Nomentana]], which runs north-east out of the city. It is a round building with well preserved original layout and mosaics. It has been built adjacent to a horseshoe-shaped church, now in ruins, which has been identified as the initial 4th-century cemeterial [[basilica]] of [[Saint Agnes]]. (Note that the much later [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura|Church of St Agnes]], still standing nearby, is distinct from the older ruined one.)&lt;ref name=Ossian&gt;{{cite book |author=Åsa Ringbom |year=2003 |title=Dolphins and mortar dating – Santa Costanza reconsidered |work=''In:'' Songs of Ossian: Festschrift in honour of Professor Bo Ossian Lindberg |series=Taidehistoriallisia Tutkimuksia – Konsthistoriska Studier (Art Historical Studies) 27 |location=Helsinki |pp=22-42 |url=http://web.abo.fi/fak/hf/konstvet/stcostanza.pdf  |accessdate=1 December 2015|quote=In all this confusion we are certain of one thing: it is premature to claim that Santa Costanza was erected between 337 and 350 as a mausoleum for and by Constantina, daughter of Constantine the Great. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Leland M. |year=1993 |title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning |edition=First |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=0-06-430158-3 |p=249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Costanza and the old Saint Agnes were both constructed over the earlier [[Catacombs of Saint Agnes|catacombs]] in which Saint Agnes is believed to be buried. 

According to the traditional view, Santa Costanza was built under [[Constantine I]] as a [[mausoleum]] for his daughter [[Constantina]], later also known as Constantia or Costanza, who died in AD 354.{{sfn|Lowden|1997|p=41}} However, more recent excavations seem to date the existing church to the time of [[Emperor Julian]] (r. 361-363), who would have built it as a funerary structure for his wife, [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], who died in AD 360, and was herself also a daughter of Emperor Constantine. If that should be the case, then the building was mainly dedicated to Helena and only secondarily to her sister Constantina, whose sarcophagus was brought into the new building from an earlier structure.{{r|Ossian}} Some consider the mausoleum to have initially had a pagan character, noting that parts of the iconography of the mosaic decorations cannot be explicitly connected to Christian motifs,{{r|Ossian}} and that the building was only later reassigned as a church dedicated to Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|pp=95-6}} Fact is that the veneration of Constantina as "Santa Costanza" (Saint Constance) is only known from the 16th century onward, and her name is not included in the [[Roman Martyrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schäfer |first=Joachim |year=2003 |title=Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon - Konstantia |format=CD-ROM |isbn=3-00-012997-9 |language=de |url=https://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienK/Konstantia.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original structure containing the tomb of Helena might be located underneath the current church, as a possibly [[Tetraconch|triconch]]-shaped structure has been partially excavated in 1987 and 1992 and computer-reconstructed by David J. Stanley.{{r|Ossian}} That could suggest that the current church is the second Christian building on the site, and may be some decades later than traditionally thought, being built as a mausoleum for Constantina's sister Helena in the reign of her husband [[Julian the Apostate]]. The larger of the two porphyry sarcophagi there would belong to Helena, and the smaller to Constantina, the opposite of what has been traditionally thought. The earlier triconch building of the 330s was probably indeed built for Constantina, but she later had to take second place to her sister; as Constantina's fame as a saintly figure developed in the Middle Ages, their roles became reversed in the popular mind.{{r|Ossian}}

The mausoleum is of circular form with an ambulatory surrounding a central dome. The fabric of Santa Costanza survives in essentially its original form. Despite the loss of the coloured stone veneers of the walls, some damage to the [[mosaic]]s and incorrect restoration, the  building stands in excellent condition as a prime example of [[Early Christian art and architecture]]. The vaults of the apses and ambulatory display well preserved examples of  Late Roman mosaics. A key component which is missing from the decorative scheme is the mosaic of the central dome. In the sixteenth-century, [[watercolour]]s were made of this central dome so the pictorial scheme can be hypothetically reconstructed.&lt;ref name=Lowden97_43&gt;{{harvnb|Lowden|1997|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The large [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] of either Constantina or her sister Helena has survived intact, and is now in the [[Vatican Museum]] - an object of great significance to the study of the art of Late Antiquity.{{r|Lowden97_43|Ossian}}

==History== 
[[File:Piranesi-2022.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.5|[[giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi's]] 18th-century reconstruction of the original plan of the funerary hall and two mausolea, with Santa Costanza at top (modern views do not support the lower one). The ground slopes away sharply on the right, and there are large buttresses, which survive. [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] would be outside the image below the bottom left corner.&lt;ref&gt;For an updated plan see: {{cite book |last=McClendon |first=Charles B. |year=2005 |title=The Origins of Medieval Architecture: Building in Europe, A.D. 600-900 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-030010688-6 |p=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P572amlqdksC&amp;pg=PA32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Location=== 
Santa Costanza is located a minute's walk to the side of the Via Nomentana, a short way outside the ancient walls of Rome. The road follows the ancient Roman route which runs north-east from Rome to [[Nomentum]] or [[Mentana]]. The area was an Imperial family estate, and the bodies of the sisters were both brought considerable distances to be buried there: [[Ammianus]] records that Constantina's body was brought back from [[Bithynia]], and Helena's from [[Gaul]] (''History'' XIV: 11, 6).{{sfn|Webb|2001|pp=250-1}} 

The mausoleum was built over the [[Catacombs of Saint Agnes|catacombs]] that contained the relics of Saint Agnes, who was martyred as a thirteen-year-old, and which was attached to the ancient basilica of Saint Agnese mid-way along the liturgical north side.&lt;ref name=roth/&gt; The basilica was originally a "funerary hall" rather than a church in the modern sense. Later legend considerably elaborated Constantina's devotion to Saint Agnes, but it now cannot be determined if this was a factor in the choice of location, although in general terms early Christians believed that their souls benefited from being buried close to martyrs, which was almost certainly a major attraction of the funerary hall to those who paid to be buried in it. Attaching an important mausoleum as an annex to a church was a common practice in Rome and can be seen the cases of other Roman churches such as the [[Mausoleum of Helena]] (Constantine's mother, not his daughter), which was attached to the basilica of [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros]], now a ruin.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1979|p=66}} 
[[File:Constantinian Basilica - Sant'Agnese fuori le mura - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright= 1.5|View into the apse of the ruined basilica, from in front of Santa Costanza]]
Of the original Basilica of St Agnese, only about a third of the main outer wall survives, from the north side and the apse at the eastern end, but at less than the original height. By the 7th-century the basilica had fallen into ruins and was too large to be refurbished, and the current much smaller Basilica of [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] was built to replace it, a few metres away.

===Purpose===
It was traditionally thought that construction began during the reign of [[Emperor Constantine I]] or shortly after, as an early history, the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', records that [[Pope Silvester I]] (d. 335) baptized Constantina and her paternal aunt in a [[baptistry]] built by Constantine there at the same time as the funerary hall. This was assumed to be the structure that survives. But excavations in 1992 discovered an earlier building beneath, and the existing building is now dated to it around 350 AD, in the reign of Helena's husband, the Emperor Julian. Constantina had died in 354, and her sarcophagus was perhaps originally placed in the earlier building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2001|p=249}}; for a superimposed plan of the two buildings see [[:File:Santakonstanza mausoleo oinplano.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The structure of Santa Costanza reflects its original function as the mausoleum of one or both Constantine's two daughters, Constantia and Helena, rather than as the church it became much later. The centralized design put "direct physical emphasis on the person or place to be honored"&lt;ref name="MichaelGough"&gt;Michael Gough, ''The Origins of Christian Art'' (New York: Praeger Publishers, Inc., 1973), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular for mausoleums and places of baptisms at this time. Other early Christian buildings with a similar origin and a circular plan include [[Split Cathedral]], built within [[Diocletian's Palace]] as his mausoleum, and the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] (now the Church of St. George]] in [[Thessaloniki]] built as a mausoleum for [[Galerius]].&lt;ref name="MichaelGough" /&gt;

The huge funerary hall or Constantinian basilica gradually fell out of use and into ruins, with the base of the wall now surviving for about a third of the original circuit of exterior walls, but Santa Costanza has survived all but intact. It is documented that [[Pope Nicholas I]] celebrated mass there in 865, the first time that "Santa Costanza" is recorded as its name, but its consecration as a church was not until 1254, by [[Pope Alexander IV]], who had what were believed to be the remains of Constantia removed from the larger sarcophagus and placed under a central altar.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}

==Architecture==
[[File:S Costanza - facciata 1160930.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.25|The facade today]] 
===Structure===
Santa Costanza is a circular, centralized structure, with a circular [[ambulatory]] ringing a high central space topped by a shallow dome, which is raised on a round [[Tholobate|drum]], as can be seen from the exterior. It is built of brick-faced concrete and its structure is basically two rings supported by columns placed around a vertical central axis. The upper ring sits on the columns while the "lower ring encloses a circular ambulatory whose space flows between the columns into the axial cylinder."&lt;ref&gt;William L. MacDonald, ''Early Christian &amp; Byzantine Architecture'' (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1962), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This design essentially creates two spaces or two worlds, that of the ambulatory and that of the upper dome. The screens of the ambulatory and inner ring create a dark contrast to the bright upper space of the dome. This contrast of light can be seen in the picture of the main interior. The single door, flanked by two arched niches, would originally have been an internal arch or doorway leading straight into the Constaninian basilica or funerary hall, half-way along its length. There is a short vestibule inside the door, opening to the ambulatory. 
[[File:Wide angle view - Santa Costanza - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view.]]
An arched arcade with twelve pairs of granite columns decorated with [[composite order|composite capitals]] supports the drum below the dome, and separates the area of the ambulatory beyond, which is much darker, as light from twelve windows in the [[clerestory]] does not reach this area as well. In contrast the central area is well-lit, creating interplay between dark and light in the interior. 

The number of arches, pairs of columns and windows could be a reference to the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Opposite the entrance in this central space there is "a kind of baldacchino...rises above a porphyry plaque which, below the middle arch of the center room, once seems to have carried the princess's sarcophagus".{{sfn|Krautheimer|1979|p=68}} This is where the sarcophagus of Constantina, or perhaps the second one, would have rested. The ambulatory is [[barrel-vault]]ed and is 22.5 meters or 74 feet in diameter.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The ambulatory has most of the surviving mosaics in the church. Larger arches mark the cardinal points in the mausoleum. The walls were probably covered in slabs of colourful marble, as was usual in imperial buildings. Santa Costanza was also to some extent a new type of building. It was different from earlier styles in that the roof, which would previously have been typically flat and made with wood, was instead designed as a dome and vault.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lowrie, ''Monuments of the Early Church'' (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1923), 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration=== 
[[File:RomaSCostanzaInterno1.jpg|thumb|The mosaics of the ambulatory vault and the paired columns]]
====Mosaics====
The mosaics of Santa Costanza are important examples of [[Early Christian art]], and even rarer examples of secular palace ceiling mosaics. The [[apse]]s, central dome, and ambulatory all had mosaic decoration, though that in the dome no longer survives.

====Mosaics in the apses====
[[File:Santa Costanza. Mosaic del S. VII “Traditio Legis” adjusted.JPG|thumb|Mosaic with the ''[[Traditio Legis]]'']]
In the ambulatory wall there are two shallow apses, each with a mosaic showing Christ as the [[Pantocrator]], the earliest surviving examples of this depiction; they probably date to the 5th or 7th century, though there has been much discussion of this.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}} Like many mosaics of the period, both have suffered from restoration and both show elements of Roman imperial imagery, representing early examples of the conflation of this with Christian art. A mosaic with two women wearing white, reported as being behind the sarcophagus in the Renaissance, has now gone and was never drawn.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}

One of the apses shows a ''[[traditio legis]]'': Christ is shown with Saints Peter and Paul giving Peter the scroll representing law, with the inscription, "DOMINUS PACEM DAT," or "The Lord is giving Peace." A few sheep represent his role as shepherd governing and leading his flock. Christ is clothed in golden robes, suggesting his power and supremacy. He is shown rising above paradise, which further shows his dominance over both heaven and earth.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=95}}

In the second apse, Christ appears somewhat more simply but still as supremely powerful. His robes are not quite as rich as in the other apse, but still suggest power. He wears a simple tunic but it is purple and gold. This suggests not only holy power, but human power given that purple is the color of royalty and the gold stripes suggestion a connection to the Roman emperors. Peter also approaches Christ in supplication, like one would approach the Emperor. This is one of the first examples in Christian art of Christ being portrayed in the same way as the emperor or royalty. It is a concept that would later be prevalent in Christian art and architecture. In this apse Christ is not just portrayed as royalty but as the ruler of the world, of all existence. He sits atop a blue sphere, a clear symbol for the world or universe. From this perch he hands keys to Peter. This is a clear sign of Christ, and the power of heaven, giving authority and holy power to man. It is also important to note that Peter was Rome's first bishop so this meant Roman authority was sanctioned by God. This concept and picture of Christ as the almighty ruler and creator of the world would be the norm in the artwork of later churches, but it first appears here at Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=96}}

====Mosaics in the ambulatory====
[[File:RomaSCostanzaMosaici02.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the ambulatory]]
The 4th-century mosaics on the ambulatory vault are contemporary with the building, and show a stark contrast to those in the apses, being essentially secular, with panels containing geometric patterns, small heads or figures within compartmented frames, birds with branches of foliage, vases and other objects, and vine patterns with cherubs harvesting and wine-making. This last type of scene also appears on Constantina's sarcophagus, as it does on the ends of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]]. While the mosaics of the apses have very clear Christian imagery, those in the ambulatory are much more secular and could be considered Dionysiac with their images of grapes, fruit, birds, and mythological figures.&lt;ref name=Beckwith70_12&gt;{{harvnb|Beckwith|1970|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of the floor mosaics which were similar in style to those in the ambulatory, filled with cupids, birds, and Bacchus and grapevines. This shows the merging of pagan and Christian values in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad, ''Medieval Art'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1986), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; These mosaics probably represent the sort of decoration found in the Imperial palaces of the period, and in general have needed little restoration.

====Central dome====
The mosaics of the central dome no longer exist, but a picture of them can still be reconstructed as between 1538 and 1540 [[Francisco de Holanda]] made watercolour copies of what then survived. In these several biblical scenes appear, resembling catacomb paintings from the 3rd century, including Susanna and the Elders, Tobias, the sacrifice of Cain and Abel, the sacrifice of Elias on Mount Carmel, possibly Lot receiving the angels, Moses striking the rock for water, and possibly even Noah building the ark. The upper row of mosaics, largely missing by the 16th century, is thought to have had scenes from the New Testament since it has the Miracle of the Centurion. These mosaics have [[caryatid]]s and acanthus-scrolls and a calendar of saints in the upper row.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} This, in conjunction with the two apses is where the majority of Christian imagery occurs.

===Sarcophagi===
[[Image:0 Sarcofago di Costantina - Museo Pio-Clementino - Vatican (1).JPG|thumb|Sarcophagus of Constantina, [[Vatican Museums]], originally stood in the mausoleum]]
Two large porphyry sarcophagi from the church are now in the Vatican; the larger and more famous (illustrated) in the [[Vatican Museums]], where it was moved during the late 18th century and is on display.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The smaller was moved in St Peter's itself (left transept) in 1606. It is now thought that the larger sarcophagus traditionally related to Constantina may in fact have housed her sister Helena, and the less spectacular one, also removed to the Vatican, was actually Constantina's.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=252}} 

Constantina's sarcophagus has complex symbolic designs in [[relief]]: "the surface is dominated by an intricate pattern of stylized vine-stems into which are fitted cherubs...with this scene of Dionysiac exuberance, and the hope of future blessedness which it implies, two peacocks, birds of immortality, are completely in accord".&lt;ref name=Milburn88_77&gt;{{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene presents an image of nature and plenty complete with grape vines, sheep and birds. The putti are framed in [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] scrolls, above which there are several images of masks. Aside from the natural scene, there are also four portraits including Constantia herself, "on the lid, four graceful portrait heads, one apparently that of Constantina, look calmly out over this assurance that the best is yet to be".{{r|Milburn88_77}} The imagery presented of wine and nature are not inherently Christian but could be perceived as such considering the use of wine in the [[Eucharist]]. Or they could be perceived as a connection to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the God of Wine.{{r|Lowden97_43}} This style of sarcophagus would cease to be used in Rome by the end of the fourth century, and this sarcophagus of Constantia is a prime example of the style.{{r|Milburn88_77}}

The sarcophagus is massive with the chest measuring 128&amp;nbsp;cm or 4&amp;nbsp;ft 2{{frac|3|8}} in high, 233&amp;nbsp;cm or 7&amp;nbsp;ft 7{{frac|1|2}} in long, and 157&amp;nbsp;cm or 5&amp;nbsp;ft 1{{frac|3|4}} in wide.{{r|Lowden97_43}} It is made of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], a hard purple stone, reserved by the Romans for use only by the imperial family, whose colour purple was. It was quarried from only one place, Mons Porphyriticus (Coptos, Egypt), making it even more exclusive.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} It appears, but can not be certain, that the sarcophagus of Constantina is a copy of that of Constantine I, her father, which is now lost. A piece of what is believed to be his sarcophagus is similar in style and of the same material.{{sfn|Beckwith|1970|p=13}} A cast replica has been placed in the church, though in the ambulatory; presumably its original position was in the centre of the church, now occupied by the altar.  There is another in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] in the city.

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

4 December 2013 by D.B.S. Jeyaraj (originally published in the Indian newsmagazine ''Frontline'' on February 13–26, 1999 Vol 16-No 04 as part of the Symposium on Sri Lanka’s Cultural Experience)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil film industry in Sri Lanka is not as developed as [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] or its Indian counterpart, the [[Tamil cinema]] of [[Kodambakkam]], [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. There is a lot of competition from Tamil films from [[Tamil Nadu]], India as well as obstacles from the long run [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic civil war in Sri Lanka]].

Tamils contributed significantly to [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] as well as Indian [[Tamil cinema]]. Only a few [[Tamil language]] films were produced in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Earlier Tamil movies produced were all most destroyed or unrecovered due to civil war. A Sinhalese film was dubbed in Tamil in December 29, 1951.&lt;ref name=search/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thaayagakkalaignarkal.blogspot.com/2007/08/blog-post_16.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie Samuthayam (Society), an adaptation of [[C.N. Annadurai]]’s ''Velaikkari'' was made in 16&amp;nbsp;mm and technicolor. It was shown in 1962 and 1963. Thottakkari (Plantation Woman), released on March 28, 1962, was the first Sri Lankan Tamil film in the standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm format. It included speeches by [[trade unionist]]s S. Thondaman and Azeez and was directed by Krishnakumar who also played the film's male lead.&lt;ref name=search/&gt;

As a rebirth of Sri Lankan Tamil cinema a comedy / thriller movie ‘'[[Komaali Kings]]’' was announced on January 23, 2016. The team says "‘Komaali Kings’ is an attempt to rekindle and re-establish nostalgic memories of the hay days of Sri Lankan Tamil Cinema".

'''Standard manuscript format''' is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works. Even with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally [[typesetting|typeset]], many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the "standard" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.&lt;ref name="Shunn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shunn|first1=William|title=Proper Manuscript Format|journal= Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal|date=December 1998|url=http://www.shunn.net/format/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=5, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[style guide]]s are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation: A Handy Reference to Resolve All Your Grammatical Problems|last= Stevenson|first=Jay|year=2005|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-393-6|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers can add the [[word count]] of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a [[query letter]]. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the [[Margin (typography)|margins]] are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.davidfarland.net/writing_tips/?a=230|title = The Importance of Standard Manuscript Format|date = 2013-06-18|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com/&gt;

==Manuscript handling==
The final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homeschoolmagazinereviews.com/en/dissertation-writing-process|title = Dissertation Writing Process|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page numbers, author's name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-basics-standard-manuscript-format-and-mailing/|title = The Basics of Manuscript Format and Mailing|date = 2010-03-27|accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = Brad R. Torgersen|publisher = |last = Torgersen|first = Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5858">[[Samuel Barber]]'s '''Symphony in One Movement''' ([[opus number|op]]. 9), was completed 24 February 1936. It was premiered by  Rome's [[Augusteo Orchestra|Philharmonic Augusteo Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Bernardino Molinari]] 13 December 1936. It lasts around 21 minutes. The title given in the printed score of the work is '''First Symphony (in One Movement)''' {{harv|Barber|1943}}, and the [[uniform title]] is '''Symphonies, no. 1, op. 9'''.

==History==
Barber commenced his work on the symphony in August 1935 and completed the work at the Anabel Taylor Foundation in Roquebrune in the French Alps. It was dedicated to his long-time companion [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] {{harv|Heyman|1992|loc=140}}. It received its American premiere by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] conducted by Rudolf Ringwall 21 and 23 January 1937 and was performed three times on 24 March 1937 at Carnegie Hall, New York by the [[New York Philharmonic|New York Philharmonic–Symphony Orchestra]] under direction of [[Artur Rodziński]] {{harv|Heyman|1992|loc=143}}. Rodziński was a strong promoter of Barber's work and conducted the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]'s performance of the symphony at the opening concert of the 1937 [[Salzburg Festival]]. It was the first performance of a symphonic work by an American composer at the festival.

==Analysis==
The symphony is a condensed one-movement version of a classical four-movement [[symphony]] and is modeled after [[Sibelius]]' [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7]] ({{harvnb|Heyman|1992|loc=141}}; {{harvnb|Pollack|2000|loc=195}}). The work is divided into four sections:

#Allegro ma non troppo
#Allegro molto
#Andante tranquillo
#Con moto

In the program notes for the New York premiere Barber explained:

{{quote|The form of my Symphony in One Movement is a synthetic treatment of the four-movement classical symphony. It is based on three themes of the initial ''Allegro non troppo'', which retain throughout the work their fundamental character. The ''Allegro ma non troppo'' opens with the usual exposition of a main theme, a more lyrical second theme, and a closing theme. After a brief development of the three themes, instead of the customary recapitulation, the first theme in diminution forms the basis of a scherzo section (''vivace''). The second theme (oboe over muted strings) then appears in augmentation, in an extended ''Andante tranquillo''. An intense crescendo introduces the finale, which is a short passacaglia based on the first theme (introduced by violoncelli and contrabassi), over which, together with figures from other themes, the closing theme is woven, thus serving as a recapitulation for the entire symphony. {{harv|Heyman|1992|loc=140}}
|}}

Barber made some revisions to the work in 1942–43. The revised version was first performed 18 February 1944 by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] conducted by [[Bruno Walter]].

Takht-i-rustam or '''Takht-e Rostam''' or '''Stupa of Takht-e Rostam'''&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;is a [[stupa]]-[[monastery]] complex 2 km south of the town of [[Haibak]]. Built in the 4-5th century AD while the area was part of the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] the complex is carved entirely from the bedrock and "consists of five chambers, two of them sanctuaries. One of them has a domed ceiling with an elaborate lotus leaf decoration. On an adjacent hill is the stupa, surmounted by a harmika, with several more rough caves around the base. A hoard of Ghaznavid coins was found by chance in one of the caves."&lt;ref&gt;mapping Buddhist monestaries, http://monastic-asia.wikidot.com/takht-i-rustam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Following the [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan]] the original purpose of the monastery was lost. Instead the site was incorporated into [[Persian mythology]] in the story of [[Rostam and Sohrab]] which forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. In the story it is said that [[Rostam]] supposedly traveled to the Kingdom of [[Samangan]] and stayed with the king at Takht-i-rustam.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hound of Florence: A Novel''''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Hund von Florenz}}) is a 1923 novel written by [[Felix Salten]]. It is best known today for partly inspiring (and even mentioned in) the 1959 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film, ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', as well as a sequel and remakes. The novel was first translated into English in 1930 by [[Huntley Paterson]], and the translation has illustrations by [[Kurt Wiese]].

''The Hound of Florence'' is an adventure story for young readers, set in early eighteenth-century [[Austria]] and Italy. The adolescent Lukas Grassi has lost his parents and lives in [[Vienna]] in great poverty, longs for his native Italy, and would like to study art in [[Florence]]. By magic, his wish is granted, but every other day he must take the form of a dog, Kambyses,&lt;ref&gt;In the English translation, the names are spelled "Lucas Grassi" and "Cambyses."&lt;/ref&gt; that belongs to the Archduke Ludwig; and alternating daily between human and canine form, he travels from Vienna to Florence along with the Archduke's troops, and there has to lead a unique double life. This is the only book of Salten in which [[supernatural]] elements occur, and they may show influence of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | page=221 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has some "overtly" autobiographical background. In 1890s the journalist Salten had become a friend and confidant of the Austrian archduke [[Archduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria|Leopold Ferdinand]], and in his novel, Salten makes use of his experiences with the archduke and his brothers. He carried the material for twenty-five years before he dared to write the story. In 1907 he mentioned [[Arthur Schnitzler]] that he was then about to finish the manuscript. However it was not until 1921 when the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |pages=33, 87–89, 131, 195–196, 204–205 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain recurring motifs in Saltens œuvre appear also in this book: the deep cleavage between the very rich and the very poor, and the critique of the [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehness (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Salten's biographer Beverley Driver Eddy, the strength of ''The Hound of Florence'' lies in the depiction of the dog Kambyses – a "brilliant portrayal of a dog's character."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Salten himself was a passionate dog lover and kept dogs most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hound of Florence'' is written as one piece. There are no chapter divisions. The 1920s German-language editions, set in [[Fraktur]], however use an embellished dash to divide the text into large sections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1980s edition uses [[asterisk]]s for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Stuttgart | publisher=Klett-Cotta | isbn=3-608-95400-7 | series=Cotta's Bibliothek der Moderne, 42 | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the book differs greatly in the original language and in the English translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of. In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages&lt;ref&gt;From page 230 on, the English translation diverts from and expands the German text.&lt;/ref&gt; has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]]. Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The English-language edition of ''The Hound of Florence'' was out of print for a long time. Only 2014 was a new edition published, this time illustrated by [[Richard Cowdrey]], using the alternate ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence | location=New York | publisher=Aladdin | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4424-8749-9 | others=Illustrated by Richard Cowdrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was translated into [[French language|French]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Le chien de Florence | location=Bruxelles | publisher=Éditions de la Paix | year=1952 | others=Traduit de l’allemand par Maurice Muller-Straus | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish-language]] edition from 2016 includes both endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Koiramme Firenzessä | location=Helsinki | publisher=Books on Demand GmbH | date=2016 | isbn=978-952-330-150-4 | language=Finnish | translator=Markus Lång }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael, een watermolen schetsend Rijksmuseum SK-A-4865.jpeg|thumb|Historical painting of Jacob van Ruisdael sketching a watermill in Gelderland, by [[Gerard Bilders]], a 19th-century landscape painter who was inspired by Ruisdael's work]]
'''''The Watermill''''' (c. 1660) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "146. THE WATER-MILL. View across the mill-pool towards 
the water-mill, which stands amid trees. The same mill as that painted by [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], as, for example, in the two pictures at the Rijksmuseum 
(see Hobbema, 66, 67). The building on the right is roofed with red tiles, and the timbers are grey. To the left is a green hill. There is no distant 
view. On the road to the left is a man, followed by a dog. To the right is a flowering elder bush. To judge from the style, the picture was 
probably painted about the time when Hobbema and Ruisdael worked together (1660-63). 
Signed with the monogram on the left ; canvas, 25 inches by 27 1/2 inches. 

Exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition, London, 1876, No. 80, and 1902, No. 134. 
In the collection of the Right Hon. Lewis Fry, Clifton, Bristol. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/51/mode/1up  Entry 146 (Ruisdael) for ''''The Water-Mill''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael and his pupil Hobbema made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Scholars have tried to locate this specific watermill as it was portrayed so many times, but so far it has only been documented as being "somewhere in [[Gelderland]]."

There are four basic theatrical forms either defined, implied, or derived by or from Aristotle: Tragedy; Comedy; Melodrama; and Drama.  Any number of styles can be used to convey these forms.

A good working definition of, "Style", is ''how'' something is done.  Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, as well as the individual style of the particular artist or artists.  As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue.

==Styles==

There are a variety of '''theatrical styles''' used in theater/drama. These include

'''[[Naturalism (theater)|Naturalism]]'''
Portraying life on stage with a close attention to detail, based on observation of real life.  Cause and effect are central to the script's structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of "nature vs. nurture", the natural order of things, survival, notions of evolution.  The production style is one of everyday reality.  

'''[[Theatrical realism|Realism]]'''
Portraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging.  Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be "normal" life.

'''[[Expressionism]]'''
Anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lying within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an eternal truth or internal emotional conflict.

'''[[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdity]]'''
Presents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that need drive us.

'''[[Epic Theatre]]'''
As devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt.

'''[[Melodrama]]'''
As devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes  to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to '''commedia dell'arte'''.

'''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]'''
As developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation.

'''[[Physical theatre]]'''
A modernist approach to theatre which centralises a performer's movement as the key communicator of a play's storytelling. 

'''[[Poor theatre]]'''
Developed by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light and sound to allow focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterisation and the underlying human relationships.

'''[[Immersive theatre]]'''
Developed by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member's individuality: their personal decisions, opinions and emotions, and how that impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the 'world of the play'. Links to '''Promenade''' and '''Forum''' theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2603">In [[game theory]] an '''uncorrelated asymmetry''' is an arbitrary asymmetry in a game which is otherwise [[symmetric game|symmetrical]].  The name 'uncorrelated asymmetry' is due to [[John Maynard Smith]] who called payoff relevant asymmetries in games with similar roles for each player 'correlated asymmetries' (note that any game with correlated asymmetries must also have uncorrelated asymmetries).  

The explanation of an uncorrelated asymmetry usually makes reference to "informational asymmetry".  Which may confuse some readers, since, games which may have uncorrelated asymmetries are still games of [[complete information]] .  What differs between the same game with and without an uncorrelated asymmetry is whether the players know which role they have been assigned.  If players in a symmetric game know whether they are Player 1, Player 2, ''etc.'' (or row vs. column player in a [[bimatrix game]]) then an uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  If the players do not know which player they are then no uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  The [[information asymmetry]] is that one player believes he is player 1 and the other believes he is player 2.  Therefore, "informational asymmetry" does not refer to knowledge in the sense of an [[Information set (game theory)|information set]] in an [[extensive form game]].

The concept of uncorrelated asymmetries is important in determining which [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] are [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] in discoordination games such as the [[game of chicken]].  In these games the mixing Nash is the ESS if there is no uncorrelated asymmetry, and the pure conditional Nash equilibria are ESSes when there is an uncorrelated asymmetry.  

The usual applied example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is territory ownership in the [[hawk-dove game]].  Even if the two players ("owner" and "intruder") have the same payoffs (i.e., the game is payoff symmetric), the territory owner will play Hawk, and the intruder Dove, in what is known as the 'Bourgeois strategy' (the reverse is also an ESS known as the 'anti-bourgeois strategy', but makes little biological sense).

==Reviews==

[[Trevor Phillips]] reviewed the work for ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Philips, Trevor |title=Books: Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge |website=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Bernadine Evaristo described the book's title as "gloriously provocative", noting that it was "marketing gold" in the climate surrounding the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Evaristo described the work as "timely and accessible", "comprehensive and journalistic" as well as "resolutely unacademic", comparing it to the work of African-American writer [[Roxane Gay]], whose 2014 anthology ''[[Bad Feminist]]'' "treads some of the same ground". However, she critiques Eddo-Lodge for not engaging in enough "rigorous research, particularly into the past" and for the fact that she "completely overlooks" the work of Black British feminist writers like Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe. Evaristo also noted that the book leaves open further questions, such as "What is the responsibility of black people in creating change for ourselves? Without also taking responsibility, we are dependent and powerless. What about the numerous positive developments since [[HMT Empire Windrush#West Indian immigrants|
''Windrush]]''?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=[[Bernardine Evaristo|Evaristo, Bernardine]] |title=Check Your Privilege |website=Times Literary Supplement |date=4 July 2017 |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/reni-eddo-lodge-review/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arifa Akbar reviewed the work for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', noting that Eddo-Lodge "builds on a critical tradition drawn from black American writers" like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[bell hooks]]. Akbar notes that "Not everyone will find the answer to racial inequality in Eddo-Lodge's reliance on white consciousness-raising, but it is an important shift that undermines the idea that racism is the BAME community's burden to carry. The liberation that this book offers is in the reversal of responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Akbar, Arifa |date=26 May 2017 |website=Financial Times |title=Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge — review |url=https://www.ft.com/content/5afdae58-3fe6-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Colin Grant (author)|Colin Grant]] places the book within a wider tradition of "angry warnings to an ignorant white readership", the majority of which have been produced by African-American rather than Black British writers. Grant opined that "Eddo-Lodge accurately takes the temperature of racial discussions in the UK" but that several sections, such as its discussion of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, are too brief, stating that "this kind of book is not designed to delve beyond the headlines in order to draw lessons from the past".&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt;

Reviewing the work for [[NPR]], the journalist Silvia Viñas stated that the work's "boldness" and "straight talk" is what makes it "memorable", also noting that while focusing "on events in Britain, it's still accessible to readers of black American history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Viñas, Silvia |title='Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race' Is A Call To Action |date=14 November 2017 |website=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/14/563728725/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race-is-a-call-to-action }}&lt;/ref&gt;
