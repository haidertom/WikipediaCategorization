The '''All-Japan Association of Photographic Societies''' was founded in 1926 under the auspices of The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a well established Japanese newspaper, and is [[Japan]]'s leading photography enthusiast group. It has about 700 local chapters with a total membership of around 14,000. It has the objectives of advancing and expanding photographic culture, holding photographic competitions and exhibitions, workshops, events and tours.&lt;ref&gt;Toshifumi Hayasaka, Secretary General, The All-Japan Association of Photographic Societies&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The International Photographic Salon of Japan ==
The primary focus of The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' and the AJAPS is on The International Photographic Salon of Japan. The first Salon was held in 1927. It was suspended during the [[World War II]] but resumed after its end. The 75th Salon will be held in 2015.

The '''Apapa Hoard''' is an important collection of medieval bronze jewellery found at [[Apapa]] near [[Lagos]], Nigeria. Dating to the early 16th Century, the hoard has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
Items from the treasure consist entirely of bronze [[jewellery]]. They include a pair of wire bracelets, two bracelets designed in the form of interlocking animals, two [[Staff of office|staff]]-mounts with [[pendant]] bells, two ring-shaped armlets, a group of bells, a ring with cascabels and a [[gorget|breast plate]] in the shape of a ram's head with pendant bells. The latter object is the most prestigious item from the hoard and is one of the finest cast bronzes ever found in southern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=619723&amp;partId=1&amp;place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered by accident in 1907 when a [[Water well|well]] was being dug to a depth of 3 metres. The jewellery would have been worn by an elite member of a local tribe living in 15th-16th centuries and has been attributed by scholars to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Kingdom of [[Owo]], which was for a long time under the control of the [[Benin Empire]]. Soon after its discovery, the hoard was acquired by a private collector who later sold it to the British Museum in 1930.

An '''artist collective''' is an initiative that is the result of a group of [[artist]]s working together, usually under their own [[management]], towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the [[artist]], this can range from purchasing bulk [[List of artistic media|materials]], sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared [[ideologies]], [[aesthetic]] and [[politics|political]] views or even living and working together as an [[extended family]]. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an [[Voluntary association|association]] or a [[company]].

==Overview==
Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on [[Milos]] in Greece and [[Carrara]] in Italy. Collectives featured during both the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the [[French Revolution]] when the [[Louvre]] in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.

More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in [[Art gallery|gallery]] shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales.  Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

'''Artists and repertoire''' ('''A&amp;R''') is the division of a [[record label]] or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of [[recording artist]]s and songwriters.&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&amp;R.

==Responsibilities==

===Finding talent===
The A&amp;R division of a record label is responsible for finding new [[recording artist]]s and bringing those artists to the record company. Personnel in the A&amp;R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&amp;R people are often young and many are musicians, [[music journalists]] or [[record producers]].{{sfn|Albini|1993}}

An A&amp;R executive is authorized to offer a [[record contract]], often in the form of a "deal memo": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company.{{sfn|Albini|1993}} The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival [[entertainment lawyer]]s hired by the musician's [[artist manager|manager]] and the record company.{{sfn|Krasilovsky|Shemel|Gross|Feinstein|2007}}

A&amp;R executives rely mostly on the [[word of mouth]] of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}} They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}}

===Overseeing the recording process===
The A&amp;R division of a record label oversees the [[sound recording|recording]] and format process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e.[[Wiktionary:repertoire|repertoire]]) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&amp;R person will assist in finding songs and songwriters. A&amp;R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing companies]] to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.

As the record nears completion, the A&amp;R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to [[marketing|market]] the record on radio.

===Assisting with marketing and promotion===
Once the record is completed, the A&amp;R department consults with marketing, [[radio promotion|promotion]], the [[recording artist|artist]] and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.

==History and influence==
The tastes of particular A&amp;R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond]] discovered [[Billie Holiday]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating "commercial" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records.{{sfn|Prial|2006}} [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as [[The Tubes]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] during his career. [[David Geffen Company|Geffen Records]]' Gary Gersh signed the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] at a time when [[alternative rock]] music was not considered commercial.{{sfn|Shoemer|1992}} Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings.{{sfn|Goldberg|2009|p=179-180}} In cases like these, A&amp;R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.

This kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&amp;R executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, [[Columbia Records]]' A&amp;R man in the 1950s, [[Mitch Miller]], favored traditional pop singers like [[Guy Mitchell]] and [[Patti Page]], and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]].

This "trend following" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including [[teen pop]] (1998–2001), [[alternative rock]] (1993–1996), [[glam metal]] (1986–1991) and [[disco]] (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Disco boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=15–35}}. Teen pop boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=}}. Knopper discusses the way the industry has overreacted to these waves throughout his book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but business people. Traditionally A&amp;R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – [[Atlantic Records]]'s heads [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] were producers and composers respectively – but an A&amp;R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] being notable recent exceptions.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Richard_Niles_Interview.html |title=Interview with Richard Niles |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=23 Apr 2007 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer and arranger [[Richard Niles]] has said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&amp;R staff are businessmen. They’re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, "Go out and get me anything that's popular now."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hip hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&amp;R executive in their single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", metaphorically likening them to "mountain climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan: 10 of the best|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/wu-tang-clan-10-of-the-best|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan Still Sting|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/wu-tang-clan-still-sting-2151230|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
According to [[Rhythm King Records]] and [[Lizard King Records]] founder Martin Heath, the A&amp;R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MartinHeath.html |title=Interview With Martin Heath |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=12 December 2005 |accessdate=20 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If scouts are chasing a band, you’ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well," he said in an interview with [[HitQuarters]].&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&amp;R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

==Recent changes==
{{See also|2000s in the music industry}}

New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&amp;R.{{sfn|Kusek|Leonhard|2005}} In the wake of [[Music industry in the 21st century|declining record sales]], a large number of A&amp;R staffers have been terminated.{{sfn|Knopper|2009|pp=220–221}} It is unclear whether A&amp;R executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.

'''Van Blarenberghe''' was the name of a dynasty of painters, originally from [[French Flanders]] ([[Lille]]) but some of the most famous descendants also lived in [[Paris]], France. They were all descendants from Joris van Blarenberghe (1612–1670). 

The first two painters were [[Hendrick van Blarenberghe]] (1646–1712) and his son [[Jacques-Guillaume van Blarenberghe]] (1679–1742). Their style was still heavily influenced by the Flemish [[Baroque]] style. Jacques-Guillaume had two painting sons, [[Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe]] (15 July 1716 – 1 May 1794) and [[Henri Désiré van Blarenberghe]] (1734–1812).

Louis-Nicolas had a son who was also a painter and with whom he often collaborated: [[Henri-Joseph van Blarenberghe]] (24 November 1750 – 1 December 1826). Together with his father, they stayed at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where they worked as [[miniaturist]]s for the high society of their day. They were especially famous for their paintings on [[Decorative boxes|snuff boxes]]. Louis-Nicolas also worked as official campaign painter of the French court, following the French army as a [[war reporter]]. Two of his daughters, Catherine-Henriette and Isabelle, were chamber maids to the children of the French kings. The works of Louis-Nicolas and Henri-Joseph were collected in profusion in the 19th century by the [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild family]].  There is a collection of their work on public display at [[Waddesdon Manor]].  An enormous collection of Blarenberghe art was sold in the [[Mentmore Towers]] sale of 1977.

Henri-Joseph painted, besides the miniatures, mainly [[Panoramic painting]]s, often in [[gouache]]. The subjects were, as with his father, often military, and also included the French revolution. He was the drawing teacher of the French princes, and founder and first conservator of the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]].

[[Image:Piling Lotus.JPG|thumb|Example of Chinese Piling painting from the Nantoyōsō Collection, Japan]]

The '''Piling School''' was a genre of [[Chinese painting]], named for its place of origin, now [[Changzhou]] in [[Jiangsu]] province. The style was influenced by contact with Japan, and examples are found almost exclusively in Japan and particularly in collections associated with the great Japanese [[Buddhist monasteries]].

==Origin==
Such paintings and associated art works are a reflection of the vigorous medieval overseas trade between China and Japan.

Piling ({{zh|c=毘陵/毗陵|p=pílíng|l=adjacent to hill (old Name of [[Changzhou]])}}) itself was a part of [[Changzhou]] close to [[Lake Tai]] in Jiangsu Province. Many other genre artists can be associated with this general area. Although their surviving works are few, the clear influence of their painting can be readily seen in shards of Yuan period blue-and-white porcelain from the [[Jingdezhen]] production area.

==Categorization==
Works of the Piling School may be rightly regarded as [[folk art|folk]] or popular works that have no association with named artists. An exception are the [[hanging scroll]]s in the  [[Chion-in Monastery]] collection in [[Kyoto]] that bear  seal designating the “Lotuses and Birds” compositions as done by a “Mr. Yu from Piling.” Mr. Yu is elsewhere identified as a Yu Ziming, active in the late 13th century. Yu was clearly a master of a local tradition of genre painting that specialized in plants, flowers, birds, insects and other genre subjects.

==Manners==
A manner of painting in this school of painting was the ''mogu'' (沒骨) or “boneless” style which eschewed clear outlines in ink for washes in color or monochrome ink itself.

==Examples in Exhibitions==
The “Egrets and Lotuses” scrolls now in the [[Tokyo National Museum]] are typical of works closer to the year 1300. They display a trend toward pattern and professional artisanship, away from the creativity that originally characterized the school.

The "Birds and Lotuses” scroll reproduced with this article can be easily seen as another example of this period work with its exclusive ink wash and stylized positioning of the birds.

The earlier scrolls in the Chion-in Monastery however are examples of works displaying a greater animation and with their use of color a greater sensuous appeal.

'''Coltura''' is an [[Environmentalism|environmental activist]] and arts group based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The group promotes environmental policies and produces street theater and other art aimed at phasing out America's use of gasoline. Coltura has produced several works critical of gasoline use which have been presented in cities in the United States and Canada. The organization advocates for laws to phase out the production and sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mynorthwest.com/774778/coltura-wants-no-gas-cars-after-2030/|title=Advocate wants to force out gas cars in Washington in 2030|last=Monson|first=Dori|date=2017-10-04|work=KIRO Radio 97.3 FM|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coltura has staged [[street theatre]] and [[performance art]] in a tradition akin to [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In September 2016, Coltura staged performances at gas stations, public events, and streets in Seattle to raise awareness about pollution-emitting gasoline vehicles. The performances were inspired by the strategies employed by the Colombian politician [[Antanas Mockus]], who as mayor of [[Bogotá]] hired [[Mime artist|mimes]] to poke fun at drivers who drove past pedestrian crosswalks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coltura performed at Seattle Design Festival, where they displayed an art installation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as performing at the First Thursday Art Walk and [[Bumbershoot]]. Actors billed as "gasoline ghosts", carrying gasoline hoses and nozzles and dressed in white [[leotard]]s, drew attention to the air pollution and [[greenhouse gas]]es created by gasoline use. The "ghosts" showed their affection for gasoline, and comedically chased down cars to inhale their exhaust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 2016, Coltura staged a procession entitled ''Funeral for Gasoline'' as part of No Gasoline Day, in which actors carried a casket containing a [[Fuel dispenser#Fuel nozzles|fuel nozzle]] from the [[Space Needle]] to [[Downtown Seattle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coltura won the 2017 [[Sustainable Seattle]] Arts and Culture Award for their No Gasoline Day performance and "for helping change cultural norms about the use of gasoline through mobile and interactive live performance, social media, and imagery and videos challenging the cultural status quo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/boomerconsumer/2017/03/10/sustainable-seattle-names-2017-award-winners-citing-regions-advances-in-sustainability/|title=Sustainable Seattle names 2017 award winners, citing region’s advances in sustainability|last=Robison|first=Rita R.|date=2017-03-10|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the group exhibited ''The Gas Trap'', a 25-foot high clear vinyl bubble connected to the tailpipe of a gasoline-powered car, accompanied by a theatrical piece. The work was a collaboration between Metz, Samaj, the Seattle Design Nerds, Alyssa Norling and Grace Orr.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/arts/956861/gas-trap-takes-dramatic-look-consequences-gasoline-use|title=The Gas Trap takes a dramatic look at the consequences of gasoline use|last=McKenzie-Sutter|first=Holly|date=2017-08-29|work=Georgia Straight|access-date=2018-01-27|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityartsmagazine.com/waiting-inhale/|title=Waiting to Inhale|date=2017-06-26|work=City Arts Magazine|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the performance first staged in [[Westlake Park (Seattle)|Westlake Park]] in Seattle, the performers appeared to be trapped inside and gasping for breath as artificial smoke filled the bubble.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The performance was staged again in Canada on September 10 at the Roundhouse Community Arts and Recreation Centre in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancourier.com/gas-trap-bursting-the-carbon-bubble-1.22521662|title=Gas Trap: Bursting the carbon bubble|last=Zeschky|first=Jan|date=2017-09-07|work=Vancouver Courier|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coltura held a mural contest in 2017 and collaborated with the artist Craig Cundiff to produce a large mural in the industrial [[Georgetown, Seattle|Georgetown]] district of Seattle. It depicts a boy wearing a mask over his mouth and nose, with a view of Seattle's congested highways, hazy sky and setting orange sun in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattlemag.com/arts-and-culture/new-georgetown-protest-mural-takes-climate-change-south-seattle-air-pollution|title=New Georgetown Protest Mural Takes on Climate Change, South Seattle Air Pollution|last=Rietmulder|first=Michael|date=2017-11-17|work=Seattle Magazine|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2018, Coltura released a report, named ''Recharge Required'', on the status of the State of Washington's varies agencies adherence to a 2007 law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/editorial-local-governments-ignoring-law-on-electric-cars/|title=Local governments ignoring law on electric cars|last=Editorial Board|date=2018-06-10|work=The Daily Herald|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring "vehicles in government fleets to run on electricity or biofuel… 'to the extent practicable'".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/gas-guzzling-cities-state-blow-past-deadline-electric-vehicles|title=Gas-guzzling cities, state blow past deadline for electric vehicles|last=Ryan|first=John|date=2018-06-01|work=KUOW News|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, in contrast to the 100% adherence set as the goal by the deadline on June 1, 2015, less than 6% of vehicles in use by county and city agencies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/washington-state-ordered-agencies-to-buy-electric-cars-theyre-falling-short-report-says/|title=Washington law ordered public agencies to buy electric cars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">A '''cultural manager''' ({{lang-es|'''gestor cultural'''}}) is a person who is motivated by the improvement of [[art]], works independently and professionally with knowledge of the subject, and develops work as a mediator between governmental and/or private cultural institutions with artists from different areas to articulate their work in the market with promotion and national and international dissemination.&lt;ref name=uoc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gestiocultural.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/06/28/que-es-un-gestor-cultural-gestion-cultural/ |title=¿Qué es un gestor cultural? |trans-title=What is a Cultural Manager? |publisher=[[Open University of Catalonia]] |language=Spanish |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural manager works by looking for specific measures of success, always intending to improve the level of culture, seeking active cohesion between society, the governmental sector, the private sector, and the artists. The work of culture management poses learning challenges in diverse areas such as the administration of economic resources, training, and artistic communication.&lt;ref name=uoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.educaweb.com/profesion/gestor-cultural-334/ |title=Gestor cultural |publisher=Educaweb |language=Spanish |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural management is a new profession. A person who is dedicated to this work is characterized by having abilities to visualize and interpret talent, knowing how to establish a dialogue with artists to link them to cultural projects to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hHxeCA_ecYC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Gestión cultural: Entre conceptos lejanos y realidades cercanas |trans-title=Cultural Management: Between Distant Concepts and Nearby Realities |chapter=Acercando realidades a través de la gestión cultural |trans-chapter=Bringing Together Realities Through Cultural Management |first1=Silvia |last1=Aballay |first2=Carla Fernanda |last2=Avendaño Manelli |publisher=Eduvim |isbn=9789871518968 |pages=13-16 |language=Spanish |year=2010 |access-date=18 April 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dancing Through Life''''' is a [[public art]] work by artist [[Schomer Lichtner]]. It is installed on the  [[Milwaukee Riverwalk|Riverwalk]] in Pere Marquette Park in downtown [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

==Description==
The steel sculpture depicts a [[ballerina]] "poised prettily" on a [[cow]].&lt;ref name=Auer&gt;{{cite news|last=Auer|first=James|title=Whimsy marked Lichtner's long artistic career|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow is painted green, purple, blue and yellow, with a black face, white triangular nose and red horns. The ballerina bends one knee to rest on the back of the cow and kicks her other leg overhead. She wears a red and white [[polka dot|polka-dotted]] [[leotard]], white [[ballet tutu|tutu]] and red [[ballet slippers]]. Both arms extend aloft, and she holds a blue fan above her head in one hand. The entire composition incorporates folds and [[assemblage art|assemblage]] to create a sense of angularity and dynamism.

==Location==
''Dancing Through Life'' occupies a prominent location at the southern entrance to Pere Marquette Park. Lichtner collaborated with the Riverwalk District BID to contribute to its [[RiverSculpture!]] program by placing the sculpture at this location.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams-Ng|first=Stacey|title=Milwaukee artists Grotenrath, Lichtner were the power couple of brush and easel|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/119956394.html#!page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''design sprint''' is a time-constrained, five-phase process that uses [[design thinking]] with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. It has been developed through independent work by many designers, including those within [[GV (company)|GV]] (formerly, Google Ventures), and those at Boston-Based User Experience Agency Fresh Tilled Soil. Two books have been published on the approach so far - one by Jake Knapp with co-authors John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprintbook.com/|title=About|website=The Sprint Book by Jake Knapp with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another by C. Todd Lombardo, Richard Banfield, and Trace Wax&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640422|title=Design sprint : a practical guidebook for building great digital products|last=Richard,|first=Banfield,|others=Lombardo, C. Todd,, Wax, Trace,|isbn=9781491923146|edition= First|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=922640422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[GV (company)|GV]], the Design Sprint concept developed from a vision to grow UX culture and the practice of design leadership across the organization. Multiple teams within Google experimented with different methods from traditional UX practice, IDEO, the Stanford dSchool and a range of other disciplines. 
The process aims to help teams to clearly define goals, validating assumptions and deciding on a product roadmap before starting development. It seeks to address [[Business strategy|strategic issues]] using interdisciplinary, rapid [[Software prototyping|prototyping,]] and [[Usability testing|user testing]]. This design process is similar to [[Sprint (software development)|Sprint]]s in an [[Agile software development|Agile]] development cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/getting-started-with-design-sprints/|title=Off To The Races: Getting Started With Design Sprints – Smashing Magazine|website=Smashing Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible uses ==

Claimed uses of the approach include

* Launching a new product or a service.
* Extending an existing experience to a new platform.
* Existing [[Minimum viable product|MVP]] needing revised [[User experience design]] and/or [[User interface design|UI Design]].
* Adding new features and functionality to a digital product.
* Opportunities for improvement of a product (e.g. a high rate of [[Abandonment rate|cart abandonment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shopify.com/blog/8484093-why-online-retailers-are-losing-67-45-of-sales-and-what-to-do-about-it|title=Why Online Retailers Are Losing 67.45%  of Sales and What to Do About It – Shopify|website=Shopify's Ecommerce Blog - Ecommerce News, Online Store Tips &amp; More|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Opportunities for improvement of a service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/service-design-sprints-deliver-speedy-improvements/|title=Service design sprints deliver speedy solutions|website= reminetwork|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phases ==
The creators of the Design Sprint approach, recommend preparation by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools working with six key 'ingredients'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672889/from-google-ventures-the-6-ingredients-you-need-to-run-a-design-sprint|title=From Google Ventures, The 6 Ingredients You Need To Run A Design Sprint|website=Co.Design|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Understand:''' Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define [[Key Performance Indicator|metrics of success]].
# '''Diverge:''' Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
# '''Converge:''' Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding.
# '''Prototype:''' Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people.
# '''Test:''' Conduct 1:1 [[Usability testing|user testing]] with (5-6) people from the product's primary [[target audience]]. Ask good questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/03/11/ask-good-questions|title=Ask good questions|last=Matveeva|first=Maria|date=March 10, 2015|website=Dockyard|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deliverables ==
The main deliverables after the Design sprint:
* Answers to a set of vital questions
* Findings from the sprint (notes, user journey maps, storyboards, information architecture diagrams, etc.)
* Prototypes
* Report from the user testing with the findings (backed by testing videos)
* A plan for next steps
* Validate or invalidate hypotheses before committing resources to build the solution

== Team ==
The suggested ideal number of people involved in the sprint is 4-7 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GV|title=Kevin Rose talks 'Sprint' with GV's Jake Knapp and Daniel Burka|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1HBqlxQjZI|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they include [[Facilitator|the facilitator]], [[designer]], a decision maker (often a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] if the company is a [[Startup company|startup]]), [[product manager]], [[engineer]] and someone from companies core business departments (Marketing, Content, Operations, etc.).

'''Eleanor Rigby''' is a statue in [[Stanley Street, Liverpool|Stanley Street]], [[Liverpool]], England, designed and made by the entertainer [[Tommy Steele]].  It is based on the subject of [[The Beatles]]' song ''[[Eleanor Rigby]]'', which is credited to the [[Lennon–McCartney]] partnership.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;

==History==
When Tommy Steele was performing in a show in Liverpool in 1981, he made an offer to [[Liverpool City Council]] to create a sculpture as a tribute to the Beatles.  His fee for the commission would be three pence.{{efn|This was an allusion to Steele's [[musical show]] and film ''[[Half a Sixpence]]''.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;}}  The offer was accepted by the Council, as it would be expected to increase the tourist trade of the city, and they made a donation of £4,000 towards its cost.  The statue took nine months to make, and it was unveiled by Tommy Steele on 3 December 1982.&lt;ref name=cav&gt;{{Citation | last = Cavanagh| first = Terry | author-link = | year = 1997| title = Public Sculpture of Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Liverpool University Press| pages = 213–214 | format = | id = | isbn = 978-0-853-23711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The statue consists of a bronze figure on a stone bench.  The bronze figure is 128&amp;nbsp;cm high, 120&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and 96&amp;nbsp;cm deep.  It depicts a seated woman with a handbag on her lap, a shopping bag on her right, and a copy of the newspaper the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' on her left.  Poking from the shopping bag is a milk bottle, and on the newspaper is a [[sparrow]] and a piece of bread.  The woman is looking down at the sparrow.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;

On the wall behind the figure is an inscribed plaque which originally read
&lt;poem&gt;{{centre|ELEANOR RIGBY}}
{{centre|DEDICATED TO}}
{{centre|"ALL THE LONELY PEOPLE..."}}
{{centre|This statue was sculpted and donated to the City of Liverpool}}
{{centre|by Tommy Steele as a tribute to the Beatles.}}
{{centre|The casting was sponsored by the Liverpool Echo.}}

but this has since been replaced.

'''Elizabeth Kirby''' (1823–1873) and '''Mary Kirby''' (later '''Mary Gregg''', 1817–1893) were successful writers and illustrators of books for children and books on natural science. Mary Kirby is known particularly for leading the [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] '''Flora of Leicestershire''' and Elizabeth for her children's books. They both had a lifelong writing partnership that popularised science. Mary is thought to be the only British woman to publish a scientific study of the flora of her county in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=creese/&gt;

==Lives==
Mary and Elizabeth Kirby were two sisters of a sometimes prosperous family who were brought up in [[Leicester]]. Mary was six years older than her sister and whilst they were still in their teens their invalid mother Sarah Bentley died. She had been the second wife of their father. Their father, John was a spiritual man who had a hosiery business. When he died in 1848 he left them with no income. He did however leave a journal which Mary continued.&lt;ref name=dave/&gt;
[[File:Golden Tail and Azure Crown Hummingbird by Elizabeth and Mary Kirby.jpg|thumb|left|Golden Tail and [[Azure-crowned hummingbird|Azure Crown Hummingbirds]] by Mary and Elizabeth Kirby.]]
Eventually his assets yielded five thousand pounds.&lt;ref name=dave&gt;[https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/Wykes2volumeLXIV-6sm.pdf Trade Flat Money Scarce Spirits Low], David Wykes, Leicester University, retrieved 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This was the same year as Mary had the first draft of the ''Flora of Leicestershire'' published which she had created with the significant assistance of [[Andrew Bloxam]]&lt;ref name=Kirb50&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirby|1850|pp=vi–vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her sister who added supporting non-botanical information. The book was cleverly crowd-sourced in 1848 as every other page was left blank.&lt;ref name=creese/&gt; The plan, which proved successful, was to ask early purchasers to make notes on the blank pages.&lt;ref name=creese/&gt; This enabled the main edition published in 1850 to list 939 different species and the book was complimented by the leading naturalist Sir [[William Jackson Hooker|William Hooker]]. Mary is thought to be the only woman in the nineteenth century to write a book about the flora of her county.&lt;ref name=creese&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary R. S. Creese|title=Ladies in the Laboratory?

With no long term income the sisters' ambitions turned to becoming professional writers.&lt;ref name=lightman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Bernard|title=Victorian popularizers of science designing nature for new audiences|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226481174|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226481174}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had both been well educated and Mary had knowledge of languages and she had made use of the lectures at the local [[mechanics institute]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
[[File:St Michael and All Angels, Brooksby - geograph.org.uk - 1229595.jpg|thumb|St Michael and All Angels, Brooksby]]
Over 25 years the sisters created books including a number that popularised science.&lt;ref name=lightman/&gt; They also wrote articles for magazines, school books, fiction as well as the natural science guides that were complete with illustrations. Their inheritance and their earnings enabled them to buy "the living" of [[Brooksby]] church for the Reverend Henry Gregg who Mary had married in 1860. Up to this time the sisters had been living in Norfolk where they had published ''Plants of Land and Water'' in 1857. After Mary's marriage the three lived together at [[Melton Mowbray]] in Leicestershire. From their purpose built house called ''Six Elms'' they worked through a number of different publishers under either their joint names or occasionally Elizabeth published her own books. Elizabeth died in 1873.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

The following year lightning struck the steeple on Brooksby Church and Mary and her husband had to handle that difficulty. The initial strike was said to have just taken a "bite" out of the steeple but eventually the whole structure collapsed. Undeterred by the damage, Gregg arranged for temporary repairs whilst services continued in parallel.&lt;ref name=leaflets&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/leafletsfrommyl00kirbgoog/leafletsfrommyl00kirbgoog_djvu.txt Leaflets from my Life], Mary Kirby, pp. 234&amp;ndash;240, retrieved 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The church was restored by 1874 by R.W.Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooksbyhall.co.uk/index.php/weddings/brooksby-church/ Brooksby Hall], retrieved 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Gregg died in 1881 and Mary had to again study her finances. Mary died in 1893 after completing her autobiography. She was buried in the same grave as both her marital partner and her writing partner at Brooksby church. Mary left her money to a surviving sister.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Ann B.

'''Eyebeam''' is a not-for-profit art and technology center in New York City, founded by John S. Johnson III with co-founders David S. Johnson and Roderic R. Richardson.

Originally conceived as a digital effects and coding [[atelier]] and center for youth education, Eyebeam has become a center for the research, development, and curation of [[new media]] works of art and [[open source technology]]. Eyebeam annually hosts up to 20 residents and co-produces youth educational programs, exhibitions, performances, symposia, workshops, [[hackathon]]s and other events with these residents as well as with partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyebeam.org/about |title=About |author=Eyebeam Art + Technology Center |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects developed at Eyebeam have received awards and recognition including [[Webby Awards]], [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], and the [[Prix Ars Electronica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Eyebeam, originally called Eyebeam Atelier, was first conceived as a collaboration between David S. Johnson, a digital artist, and John S. Johnson III, a filmmaker and philanthropist.  The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages.  The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, [[John Seward Johnson II]] and the [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] collective.  After observing [[new media]] as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jana |first1=Reena |year=2002 |title=Johnson and Johnson Heir Founds Digital Art Museum |journal=Carrindex Gabrius }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Elegant Marriage of Inside and Outside |author=Herbert Muschamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/arts/design/21MUSC.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new [[media literacy|media education]], was founded in 1998; in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Allan |year=1998 |title=Eyebeam Atelier |journal=TheBlowUp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of [[bioart]], [[Urban Interventionism|urban interventionism]], [[game design]], and [[wearable technology]].

Eyebeam’s first forum, “Interaction,” took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by [[UCSD]] professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an [[email list]] called &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt;, was hosted by [[Brian Holmes]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and [[Gregory Ulmer]], and included [[Lev Manovich]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[Saskia Sassen]], [[Matthew Slotover]], [[Ken Goldberg]], [[Geert Lovink]], [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]], [[Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger]], [[Mark Tribe]], and [[Critical Art Ensemble]] among the participating  artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt; were compiled into a book titled “Interaction: Artistic Practice on the Network” and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flagan |first1=Are |year=2001 |title=Interaction – Artistic Practice in the Network – Review |journal=Afterimage |issue=July/August }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Avant-Garde Design For A New Media Center |author=Julie V. Iovine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/arts/an-avant-garde-design-for-a-new-media-center.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 21, 2002 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro|Diller + Scofidio]]’s “Olympic class” design named the winner of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Kevin |title= Building the Better Mousetrap |pages=Issue No. 315 |publisher=Time Out New York |date= October 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyebeam held its first [[open studio]]s for artists in residence and fellows in 2002. [[Alexander R. Galloway]], [[G. H. Hovagimyan]], [[Tony Martin (artist)|Tony Martin]], [[Yael Kanarek]], [[M.River &amp; T.Whid Art Associates|MTAA]], [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], [[Jem Cohen]], [[Cory Arcangel]], and [[Michael Bell-Smith]] were among the inaugural exhibitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Among the projects on display was Galloway’s Carnivore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r-s-g.org/carnivore/|title=Carnivore|work=r-s-g.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=8785/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rojas |first1=Pete |year=2003 |title=Digital Details: Internet Surveillance Tools Make For Unlikely Inspiration |journal=Surface |issue=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnivore takes its name and function from [[Carnivore (software)|DCS1000]], a surveillance system used by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]].

During their R&amp;D Fellowships, [[Theo Watson]] and [[Zachary Lieberman]] continued to develop [[openFrameworks]], a C/C++ library originally created at [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons]]. Together with [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]], openFrameworks became one of the most popular platforms for [[creative coding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/qa-with-zach-lieberman-founder-of-openframeworks-pt-i |title=Q&amp;A With Zachary Lieberman, Founder of openFrameworks (pt.1) |author=Julia Kaganskiy |date=August 3, 2010 |work=The Creators Project |publisher=VICE Media |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the [[Graffiti Research Lab]]. Founded by [[James Powderly]] and [[Evan Roth]] during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Writing's on the Wall.

(Free Art and Technology) Lab]], a collective dedicated to the merging of [[open source]] technology and [[popular culture]], with [[Theo Watson]], Chris Sugrue, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/net-art-powerhouse-fat-lab-featured-on-pbs-arts-video |title=Net Art Powerhouse F.A.T.

Eyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spare Times |author=Melena Ryzik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/arts/16wspare.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event, “Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),” was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] and [[Wards Island]] by media artist [[Benton C Bainbridge]]. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City’s underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including [[Dam Funk|DāM-FunK]], [[Paper Rad|Extreme Animals]], [[CHERYL]], and [[D-Fuse AV]]. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. 
In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in [[Talk to Me (exhibition)|''Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects'']] at the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir’s littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=145485 |title=MoMA – The Collection – Ayah Bdeir. littleBits. 2008. |date= |work=The Museum of Modern Art |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the first ever [[Wikipedia:Meetup/ArtAndFeminism|Art + Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon]] was hosted at Eyebeam and co-organized by fellow [[Laurel Ptak]] in conjunction with more than 30 satellite edit-a-thons internationally across the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

In July 2014 Eyebeam left their Chelsea space and now operates out of an interim space in [[Industry City]] in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]].

Since November 2017 Eyebeam has been located at 199 Cook Street in Brooklyn. This coincides with their 20th anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/408850/eyebeam-new-bushwick-home-at-20/|title=As Eyebeam Turns 20, the Arts Nonprofit Moves to Bushwick|date=2017-11-01|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an organization which was celebrated in Spring 2018.

'''Foster + Partners''' is a British international studio for architecture and [[integrated design]], with headquarters in London. The practice is led by its founder and chairman, [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], and has constructed many high-profile glass-and-steel buildings.

==History==

[[File:Foster and Partners London Office.jpg|thumb|Foster + Partners London office]]

Established by Norman Foster as '''Foster Associates''' in 1967 shortly after leaving [[Team 4]], the firm was renamed '''Sir Norman Foster and Partners Ltd''' in 1992 and shortened to '''Foster &amp; Partners Ltd''' in 1999 to more accurately reflect the influence of the other lead architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/01644989|title=Foster + Partners Limited|publisher=[[Companies House]]|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the private equity company [[3i]] took a stake in the practice. This was bought back by the practice in June 2014 to become wholly owned by the 140 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=David|title=Foster's buys out private equity stake|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/fosters-buys-out-private-equity-stake/5069471.article|website=[[Building Design]]|accessdate=2 July 2014|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In June 2008, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an article highly critical of planned real estate development in a pristine seacoast area in [[Bulgaria]] which is currently under [[Natura 2000|EU environmental protection]]. The paper cited environmentalists' concerns over the impact of the planned 15,000 inhabitant resort facilities. The Bulgarian partner, Georgi Stanishev, is the brother of Sergei Stanishev, Leader of Bulgarian Socialist Party, Prime Minister of Bulgaria between 17 August 2005 and 27 July 2009 [[Sergei Stanishev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/14/greenbuilding.climatechange|title=Bulgarian eco town 'the biggest mistake of Norman Foster's career', say protesters|author=Kate Connolly | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Giacomo Joyce''''' is a posthumously-published work by Irish writer [[James Joyce]]. Written in 1914, following the publication of ''[[Dubliners]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://theoxenofthesun.blogspot.com/2009/05/giacomo-joyce-by-james-joyce-love-me.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[Faber and Faber]] from sixteen handwritten pages by Joyce. In the free-form love poem, presented in the guise of a series of notes, Joyce attempts to penetrate the mind of a "dark lady", the object of an illicit love affair.

"Giacomo" is the Italian form of the author's forename, [[James (name)|James]].

[[Image:DoubleJettiedBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|A double jettied [[timber framing|timber-framed]] building. The ends of the multiple [[cantilever]]ed joists supporting the upper floors can easily be seen.]]

'''Jettying''' (jetty, jutty, getee (obsolete) from Old French getee, jette)&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. 1989. Jetty&lt;/ref&gt; is a building technique used in [[medieval]] [[timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings in which an upper floor projects beyond the dimensions of the floor below. This has the advantage of increasing the available space in the building without obstructing the street. Jettied floors are also termed ''jetties''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/943487 Illustration of a jettied house]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.plus.com/houses/page4.html Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the most common surviving colonial version of this is the [[Garrison (architecture)|garrison]] house.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George, and M. Margaret Geib. Wood, brick, and stone: the North American settlement landscape. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Most jetties are external, but some early Medieval houses were built with internal jetties.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, N. A., Michael Laithwaite. "Medieval Houses in Devon and Their Modernization". ''Medieval Archaeology'' vol. 17 (1973), 100–125.
http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol17/17_100_125.pdf accessed 01/08/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Hildesheim-Markt-Knochenhaueramtshaus.Detail.01.JPG|thumb|The under-side of jetties in Germany are sometimes decorated and called a windbrett (wind board). This is an example of a jetty supported on brackets.]]
A jetty is an upper floor that depends on a [[cantilever]] system in which a horizontal beam, the jetty bressummer, supports the wall above and projects forward beyond the floor below (a technique also called  ''oversailing'').{{dubious|This is just one way of hadling a jetty, and one not used by one -half, that is, of the illustrations.|date=December 2015}} The [[bressummer]] (or breastsummer) itself rests on the ends of a row of jetty beams or [[joist]]s which are supported by jetty plates. Jetty joists in their turn were slotted sideways into the diagonal [[dragon beam]]s at angle of 45° by means of [[mortise and tenon]] joints.

The overhanging corner posts are often reinforced by curved jetty brackets.

The origins of jettying is unclear but some reasons put forward for their purpose are:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Richard. Discovering timber-framed buildings. 2d ed. Aylesbury: Shire Publications, 1979. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To gain space.
* The structural advantage of the jettied wall counteracting forces in the joists or tying a stone wall together
* To shelter the lower walls of the house from the weather.
* To simplify joinery.
* Uses shorter timbers, a benefit due to timber shortages and difficult handling of long timbers especially in city streets.
* As a status symbol&lt;ref&gt;Garvan, Anthony N. B., Architecture and Town Planning in Colonial Connectucut (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; or "...symbol of wealth and status."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Richard. Discovering timber-framed buildings. 2d ed. Aylesbury: Shire Publications, 1979. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jetties were popular in the 16th century but banned in Rouen in 1520 relating to air circulation and the plague, and London in 1667 relating to the great fire. They are considered a Gothic style.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Structurally, jetties are of several types:
* Framed on multiple joists.
* Framed on a few beams.
* Framed on [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s added to the posts.
* Hewn jetty also called a false jetty: Framed on projections of the posts rather than on cantilevered beams (or brackets).&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. Dictionary of architecture and building construction. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008. 144. false jetty.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical elements==
[[File:Paul Revere House Boston MA.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere House]] Boston, MA built 1680. This is framed on a few cantilevered beams.]]
[[File:Glattfelden - Klingelehaus (Gottfried-Keller-Zentrum), Gottfried-Keller-Strasse 8 2011-09-15 13-49-20 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|An example of a hewn jetty in Glattfelden, Switzerland]]
The vertical elements of jetties can be summarized as:
* the more massive corner posts of the timber frame that support the dragon beam from the floor below and are supported in their turn by the dragon beam for the extended floor above.
* the less substantial [[Wall stud|studs]] of the [[close studding]] along the walls above and below the jetty.

==Horizontal elements==
[[File:Dragon-encorbellement-Prieuré de Saint-Arnoult-21-09-2007.jpg|thumb|Jetties in French are called an encorbellement and may be decoratively carved. Prieuré de Saint-Arnoult, France]]
The horizontal elements of jetties are:
* the jetty breastsummer (or bressummer), the sill on which the projecting wall above rests; the bressummer stretches across the whole width of the jetty wall
*the dragon-beam which runs diagonally from one corner to another, and supports the corner posts above and is supported in turn by the corner posts below
*the jetty beams or joists which conform to the greater dimensions of the floor above but rest at right angles on the jetty-plates that conform to the shorter dimensions of the floor below. The jetty beams are morticed at 45° into the sides of the dragon beams. They are the main constituents of the cantilever system and they determine how far the jetty projects
*the jetty-plates, designed to carry the jetty-beams or joints. The jetty-plate itself is supported by the corner posts of the recessed floor below.

==Cantilever==
{{Main|Cantilever}}
Jettying was used for timber-framed buildings, but was succeeded by cantilever which are used for the same reason as jettying, to maximise space in buildings. This is often utilised on buildings which are on a narrow plot and space is at a premium.

==Forebay==
The [[Pennsylvania barn]] in the U.S. has a distinctive cantilever called a forebay, not a jetty.&lt;ref&gt;Ensminger, Robert F.. "Origin." The Pennsylvania barn: its origin, evolution, and distribution in North America. 2nd ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mediterranean area==
The traditional Turkish house is a [[Timber framing#Half-timbering|half-timber]]ed house with a cantilevered or supported overhang called a cumba.

In the North African Maghreb, houses in medieval city Kasbahs often featured jetties. Contemporary examples still survive in the [[Casbah of Algiers]].

The House of [[Opus craticum|Opus Craticum]] built before AD 79 in Roman [[Herculaneum]] has a supported cantilever.

'''''Jungle Jitters''''' is a [[1938]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].

==Plot==
[[File:Jungle Jitters.ogv|thumb|left|Jungle Jitters]]
[[File:Una escena de la caricatura 'Jungle Jitters'.png|thumb|left|A scene from the film.]]
In an African jungle, the natives are going about their day, with the jungle elements being intertwined with modern-day elements; for example, the people dancing around a tent when it turns into a makeshift merry-go-round, to the tune of ''[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]'' which has since become the longtime ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theme song.

A traveling dog-like salesman named Manny (a parody of [[Al Pearce]]'s character Elmer Blurt) comes by to offer them the latest in "assorted useful, useless, utensils".  The natives capture him, throw him into a pot of boiling water, and ransack his goods.  They proceed to familiarize themselves with vacuum cleaners, batteries, light bulbs, etc.

When the salesman is introduced to the village queen (depicted as a chicken-like white woman, possibly to avoid any problems with the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays code]] over the issue of [[miscegenation]]), she takes a liking to him, imagining Manny the salesman as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  The salesman finds himself with the choice between a forced marriage with the homely queen, or the boiling pot of water.  He chooses the pot, and in a closing shot as he sinks into the broth, hopes "they all get indigestion."

==Availability==
*''Jungle Jitters'' fell into the [[public domain]] in 1966, and is available on many public domain home video collections.

==See also==
*[[List of animated films in the public domain in the United States]]

==Notes==
*Because of the [[ethnic stereotyping|racial stereotypes]] used against [[African-American|black people]] throughout the short, it prompted [[United Artists]] to withhold it from [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] within the United States in 1968. As such, the short was placed it into the so-called [[Censored Eleven]], a group of eleven ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' shorts withheld from television distribution in the United States since 1968 due to heavy stereotyping of black people.&lt;ref&gt;The Straight Dope.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The short was also referenced in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short, ''[[The Ducksters]]'' (1950), but is not related to what [[Daffy Duck]] was talking about because he mentioned a gorilla and the original short did not feature a gorilla.

===Historic Royal Palaces commission===
In 2010 Haste was commissioned by [[Historic Royal Palaces]] to create a series of pieces, (thirteen in total), which tell the story of the [[Tower of London#Menagerie|Royal Menagerie]] that had existed at the [[Tower of London]] from 1210 until 1833. Throughout the 600 years that there was a menagerie at the Tower of London, apes and monkeys were always a feature. Baboons roamed the Tower freely until, in 1833, a child was killed by their aggressive behaviour. Soon after, the entire menagerie was moved to [[Regents Park]], to become what is today the [[London Zoo]]. Using research from the Tower of London archives, Haste returned the animals to their original locations around the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/39825/Historic-Royal-Palaces-Awards-Sculpture-Commission-to-Kendra-Haste#.WGqNtFz8N7l|title= Historical Royal Palaces Awards Sculpture Commission to Kendra Haste |publisher=Artdaily.com|date=August 9, 2010|accessdate = December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/news-and-media/press-resources/tower-of-london-press-releases-and-archives/tower-of-london-press-release-archive/may-2011-royal-beasts-return-to-the-tower-of-london/#gs.DFZ2EQI|title= Royal Beasts Return to the Tower of London|last1=|first1=|publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]]|date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/tall-tales-6403251.html|title= Tall Tales|last1=Jeffs|first1=Lotte|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

===Waterloo Elephant===
[[File:6.Haste Waterloo Elephant.jpg|thumb|alt=The elephant at Waterloo Station between two arches.|thumb|left|Haste's ''Elephant'' at London's [[Waterloo station]].]] 
Haste's Waterloo ''Elephant'' was originally commissioned by the [[London Underground]] as part of its [[Platform for Art]] programme and set up at the [[Gloucester Road tube station]]. After the success of Haste's "Underground Safari" pieces, the London Underground purchased the African elephant sculpture and installed it near the ticket hall of a new [[Jubilee line]] extension at the [[London Waterloo station]]. The new location is on the site of the old [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] – sometimes considered the world's first [[circus ring]] – where in 1828 an elephant that was part of the show was frightened and blundered into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2015/02/why-is-there-an-elephant-in-waterloo-station|title=Why is There an Elephant in Waterloo Station|date=October 2015|publisher=[[Londonist]]|last1=Brown|first1=Matt|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/london/things-to-do/unusual-things-to-do-in-waterloo-station/|title=7 Things You Might Not Have Done in Waterloo Station|date=7 November 2016|publisher=Londonist|last1=Hanson|first1=Kyra|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''LafargeHolcim Awards''' is an international competition that seeks projects and visionary concepts in [[sustainable]] construction – irrespective of scale. A total of USD 2&amp;nbsp;million in prize money is awarded in each three-year cycle.&lt;ref name="Holcim Awards Schedule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/prizesandschedule |title=Holcim Awards Schedule|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eligible for entry are projects in: buildings and civil engineering works; landscape, urban design and infrastructure; and materials, products and construction technologies. The LafargeHolcim Awards is conducted by the [[LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction]] based in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="HolcimFoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org |title=Holcim Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries can only be made online.&lt;ref name="OpenForEntries"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/398738/ |title=The 4th Edition of the Holcim Awards Now Open for Entries |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition was known as the Holcim Awards from 2003. Holcim Ltd and Lafarge S.A. completed their global merger and launched [[LafargeHolcim]], a world leader in the building materials industry, in July 2015. The name of the foundation was changed to LafargeHolcim Foundation, and the competition became the LafargeHolcim Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The initiatives of the LafargeHolcim Foundation|url=http://lafargeholcim-foundation.org/AboutPages/initiatives|website=LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction|publisher=LafargeHolcim Foundation|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional and global phase==

The LafargeHolcim Awards competition opens with five regional LafargeHolcim Awards competitions and is followed by the Global LafargeHolcim Awards. The regional LafargeHolcim Awards are based on five geographic areas: [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Africa Middle East]], and [[Asia Pacific]]. Entries in the competition are allocated to a region based on the location of the project.

==LafargeHolcim Awards (main) and “Next Generation” (student) categories==

There are two categories within the competition:&lt;ref name="Award Categories"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/overview |title=Holcim Awards Categories|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holcim Awards Categories 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bustler.net/index.php/article/winners_of_regional_holcim_awards_competition_announced_in_new_delhi/ |title=Awards Categories featured in Bustler.net |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main category of the competition is open to architects, planners, engineers, and project owners that showcase sustainable responses to technological, environmental, socioeconomic and cultural issues affective contemporary building and construction. The fifteen projects that receive LafargeHolcim Awards Gold, Silver or Bronze in the five regions are then qualified for the competition for the Global LafargeHolcim Awards.&lt;ref name="LafargeHolcim Awards Global Winners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/222057/global-holcim-award-2012-winners-announced/ |title=Global Holcim Awards winners 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “Next Generation” category is open to bold ideas and visions of students in between the age of 18 and 30.

==Evaluation criteria==

Submissions in both categories are evaluated by independent juries, using five “target issues” to define sustainable construction.&lt;ref name="TargetIssues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimawards.org/target |title=Target issues for sustainable construction|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these align with the [[triple bottom line|triple bottom line concept]] of balanced social, environmental and economic performance. The two remaining target issues define contextual and aesthetic impact, as well as innovation and transferability.

==Juries==

The independent juries consist of renowned experts from architecture, engineering, planning, and the construction industry.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/awards/5th-cycle/global/JuryGlobal|title=Global LafargeHolcim Awards Jury|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Prizes==

The total prize money for each cycle of the regional and global LafargeHolcim Awards competitions is USD 2 million.&lt;ref name="StepByStep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/prizesandschedule |title=Prizes and schedule |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze Age 'lock-ring' (FindID 269841).jpg|thumb|A lock ring found in Buckinghamshire]]
A '''lock ring''' is the name given by [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[jewellery]] from [[Bronze Age]] [[Europe]].

They are made from gold or bronze and are penannular, providing a slot that is thought to have been used for attaching them as earrings or as hair ornaments. [[Ireland]] was a centre of production in the [[British Isles]] though rings were made and used across the continent, notably by the [[Unetice culture]] of [[Central Europe]].

The technology at the time used a slot in the metal to lock the ring to a jewel. Other features included a decorated face plate and a triangular cross-section. Lock rings have been found in modern-day Ireland, France, and Great Britain. Gold was used for the majority of lock rings that have been found, though other artifacts constructed out of bronze, or clay, gold and bronze composite have been found.

The '''Veveri Madonna''', also called the '''Madonna of Veveri''' ({{lang-cs| Madona z Veveří }}, {{lang-de| Madonna von Eichhorn }} ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/madonna-of-veveri?excludenudity=true&amp;mediatype=photography&amp;phrase=madonna%20of%20veveri&amp;sort=mostpopular Madona of Veveri - Getty images]&lt;/ref&gt; is an tempera painting by the unknown moravian, bohemian (or probably italian) (active in [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian lands]]) artist generally called [[Master of Vyšší Brod]]. The altarpiece was commissioned after 1344 by Margrave [[John Henry, Margrave of Moravia|John Henry of Luxembourg]] for the romanesque church of [[Assumption of Our Lady]], In the neighborhood of [[Veveří Castle|royal Veveří castle]] in [[Brno]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Republic]]. Exhibited in [[Diocesan Museum in Brno]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguemonitor.com/2016/02/17/national-gallery-seeks-review-rare-paintings-return-church National Gallery seeks review of rare painting's return to Church]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/1144848-madona-z-veveri-a-madona-ze-zbraslavi Program in Czech TV on Madona of Veveri as a gem of medieval Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter van Mensch: Museums and their collections - new perspectives on ownership
[http://www.provenienzforschung.info/vanmensch_collection.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The panel was one of the first Madonnas painted by the artist. [[Albert Kutal]] a Czech scholar called it "a truly rare and extraordinary work".&lt;ref&gt;FILIPOVÁ, Marta, The Construction of national identity in the historiography of Czech art.
[http://theses.gla.ac.uk/791/1/2009Filipovaphd.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The painting is in [[tempera]] on [[pine wood]] panel, canvas-covered with gently [[pastiglia]] [[stucco]] relief decoration and of [[Gilding|additional gold metal slices]], measures 79,5&amp;nbsp;cm by 62,5&amp;nbsp;cm. Madonna, Mary is seen half-figure with the Child in her lap, holding the [[Christ Child]]. The latter's left hand is touching his mother's, while under the right hand holds a [[bird]] – [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], (because of the thistle seeds the goldfinch often eats, in [[Christian symbolism]] the goldfinch is associated with [[Christ's Passion]] and his crown of thorns).  The Virgin Mary is [[Coronation|coronated]] by double crown on uncovered loose hair, without a veil. Some [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]-[[Italian art|Italian]] traces notwithstanding, the painting shows a further step in the assimilation of Italian influences, which are adapted in an individually and stylistically balanced manner.

== Painting materials ==
Pigment analysis of Master of Vyšší Brod's masterpiece reveals the usual pigments of the high gothic period such as [[ferric oxide]] mixed with orpiment in the red drapery on top of the painting, [[Ultramarine|natural ultramarine]] mixed with lead white in the blue robe of Madonna (inside).

'''Multimedia translation''', also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of [[Multimodality|multimodal]] and [[multimedia]]l texts into another language and/or culture.&lt;ref&gt;González, Luis Pérez. "Audiovisual Translation", in [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] and Gabriela Saldanha (eds.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies'', London, 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.

==Application==
Multimedia translation can be applied to  various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.

Audiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of [[Social semiotics|semiotic]] resources or ‘modes’.&lt;ref&gt;Baldry, Anthony and Paul J. Thibault. ''Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis'', London &amp; Oakville: Equinox, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  When various modes, such as [[language]], [[image]], [[music]], [[colour]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Multimedia'' [Interview]. Hightech (August 1991): 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Christopher J.|year=2003|title=Multimodal Transcription in the Analysis, Translation and Subtitling of Italian Films|journal=The Translator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1080/13556509.2003.10799153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Academic study of multimedia translation==
The translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of [[translation studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Cintas, Jorge. ''New Trends in Audiovisual Translation''. Bristol/Buffalo/Toronto: Multilingual Matters. 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84769-154-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlović|first=Nataša|year=2004|title=Addressing Power and Solidarity in TV Subtitling|journal=Across Languages and Cultures|volume=5|issue=2|pages=211–232|doi=10.1556/Acr.5.2004.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Modes of translation==
This kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.

[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]], sometimes known as "lip-synchrony", involves both the translation and its [[Synchronization|synchronisation]] as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isabel|first=Ana|last2=Bartolomé|first2=Hernández|last3=Cabrera|first3=Gustavo Mendiluce|year=2005|title=New Trends in Audiovisual Translation: The Latest Challenging Modes|url=http://www.miscelaneajournal.net/images/stories/articulos/vol31/bartolome31.pdf.|journal=Miscelánea|volume=31|pages=89–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the "timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue" as closely as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audiovisual Translation Theories, Methods And Issues|last=Pérez-Gonzalez|first=Luis|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Subtitling ===
The most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys "a target language version of the source speech."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open [[Closed captioning|captions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Voice over ===
[[Voice-over|Voice over]] involves the original [[soundtrack]] and the translation being broadcast simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voice over is considered a "cheap alternative to dubbing" so it is the first choice for translating films in former [[Communist state]]s and some countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Interpreting ===
[[Language interpretation|Interpreting]] is "the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode is usually used in live [[interview]]s and news broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Surtitling ===
[[Surtitles|Surtitling]] is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Becoming more frequent in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] and [[Opera house|operahouses]], the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Free commentary ===
Free commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in [[Children's television series|children's television shows]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], humorous videos, [[Parody|film parodies]] and [[corporate video]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partial dubbing ===
Also known as "half-dubbing" or "concise synchronisation", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Narration ===
[[Narration]] consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It can be pre-recorded or performed live.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Simultaneous translation ===
Also known as "sight translation", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is different from interpretation in that "it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Live subtitling ===
Also known as "real-time subtitling", it differs from regular subtitling in that the [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A "respeaker" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and "respeaks" it into a speech recognition software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Subtitling for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH) ===
[[Subtitle (captioning)#SDH|SDH]] is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to "see" the sound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the "growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements" for [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling companies.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Audio description (AD) ===
[[Audio description|AD]] is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reader, known as an "audio describer", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation has become important in "ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Animation ===
Animation involves translation as well as script writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Double version ===
Double versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Remake ===
Remakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Teaching==
Since the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences|Winterthur]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">The '''Northumbrian Pipers' Society''' is a society, founded to promote both [[Types of bagpipes|types]] of [[Northumbrian]] bagpipes - the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] and the half-long pipes, now generally known as the [[Border pipes]]. There had been several attempts to encourage the pipes and their music during the 19th century, but no society was formed with this specific aim until the [[Northumbrian Small Pipes Society]] in 1893. That society organised a series of competitions, in which [[Richard Mowat]] and [[Henry Clough]] were both prizewinners. However it was short-lived, dissolving around 1899. Today the society is divided into two branches, the main branch based in [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], and the Cleveland branch based in [[Sedgefield]].

The Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded in 1928 in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], under the patronage of the Duke of Northumberland. The first President was G.V.B. Charlton, who had been active in encouraging the playing of the smallpipes, and particularly the revival of the half-long pipes. Its policy aim was to encourage and stimulate 'the younger generation of pipers and beginners in pipe playing'. [[Billy Pigg]], an influential piper, was a Vice-President from 1930, while [[Tom Clough]], known as the 'Prince of Pipers', accepted a Vice-Presidency in 1933. At first they met in each other's homes to exchange tunes and to organise the occasional dance. In 1937 they acquired a permanent home in the [[Morden Tower]] in Newcastle. The Society's regular meetings and annual competitions are currently held the Chantry Bagpipe Museum, in Morpeth. It also holds an annual concert in Morpeth. It publishes a quarterly newsletter and an annual magazine, as well as many important collections of pipe music, including, in 2000 'The Clough Family of Newsham',&lt;ref&gt;The Clough Family of Newsham, {{ISBN|0-902510-20-7}}, edited by Chris Ormston and Julia Say&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed study of the music of [[Tom Clough]] and his family, and, in 1997, 'The Border Minstrel',&lt;ref&gt;Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C. Ross and J. Say, {{ISBN|978-0-902510-30-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-902510-31-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which included all of [[Billy Pigg]]'s known compositions, and some other tunes from his repertoire. Other important recent tunebooks include a new edition of [[John Peacock (piper)|John Peacock]]'s early tunebook,&lt;ref&gt;Peacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999), {{ISBN|0-902510-19-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of [[James Hill (folk musician)|James Hill]]'s hornpipes and other tunes, adapted for the smallpipes,&lt;ref&gt;The Fiddle Music of James Hill, ({{ISBN|0-902510-27-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; and a tunebook and tutor for the [[Border pipes]]. They also published an important book on pipemaking, by [[William Alfred Cocks]] and [[Jim Bryan (piper)|Jim F. Bryan]], 'The Northumbrian Bagpipes', in 1967.

The relative popularity of the instrument today, compared to the small numbers of players in the early 20th century, the wider availability of well-made instruments, and the availability in print of much of the instrument's traditional repertoire, can all be ascribed, directly or indirectly, to the work of the Society.

The Society converted to charitable status on 1 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northumbrianpipers.org.uk/index.php?page=the-northumbrian-pipers-society&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ontario Arts Council''' ('''OAC''') is a publicly funded Canadian organization in the province of [[Ontario]] whose purpose is to promote and assist the development of the arts for the enjoyment and benefit of all Ontarians. Based in [[Toronto]], OAC was founded in 1963 by Ontario's [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] at the time, [[John Robarts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.on.ca/site4.aspx Ontario Arts Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030131950/http://www.arts.on.ca/site4.aspx |date=30 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OAC plays a vital role in fostering the stability and growth of Ontario's arts community. An arm's-length agency of the [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]], OAC offers more than fifty funding programs for Ontario-based artists and arts organizations. Grants provide assistance for a specific activity, support for a period of time, or for ongoing operations. OAC administers the Premier's Awards for Excellence in the Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2015/10/winners-announced-for-premiers-awards-for-excellence-in-the-arts.html|title=Winners Announced for Premier's Awards for Excellence in the Arts|date=12 October 2015|work=News release|publisher=[[Queen's Printer for Ontario]]|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers additional prizes as well as scholarships from private funds, and further supports Ontario's arts community by conducting research and statistical analyses of the arts and culture. OAC staff manage granting programs, while a 12-member volunteer board of directors oversees the fulfilment of the organization's mandate. The board of directors is appointed by the [[Government of Ontario]] for a three-year term (and may be re-appointed for one additional term).

OAC provides grants in three ways:

* Artistic discipline: [[crafts]], dance, theatre, literature; music; [[visual arts|visual]] and [[media arts]].
* Artistic or other activity: arts education; [[community arts]]; touring; residencies; and capacity building/professional development.
* Cultural practice: [[Native American art|Aboriginal Arts]] and [[Franco-Ontarian]] Arts.

The '''Pasadena Society of Artists''', founded in 1925, is one of the longest-running, nonprofit arts organizations in the state of California, USA.

==Overview==
Pasadena Society of Artists, from its founding, attracted practitioners of a variety of artistic styles, including impressionists, modernists, abstract artists and traditionalists.  

During its formative years, the Pasadena Society of Artists was associated with the [[Pasadena Arts Institute]].  As a result, its membership had close ties with the [[Pasadena Museum of Art]] (which later became the [[Norton Simon Museum]]) and the [[Pacific Asia Museum]].

Pasadena Society of Artists continues to hold frequent [[Juried (competition)|juried]] exhibitions of its members works, and its Annual Exhibitions have taken place without interruption since 1925.

==1920s to 1950s==
PSA's formation closely followed the founding of the Pasadena Arts Institute, and many of its first members were involved in the creation of both institutions.  Its first president was landscape artist [[Edward B. Butler]], a successful businessman who retired to pursue his career as an oil painter.  Early members of the Society included nationally-renownded arstists, including California [[impressionists]] [[Alson S. Clark]] and [[Marion Wachtel]], and the noted adherent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] [[Ernest A. Batchelder]], 

From the 1920s into the 1950s, Pasadena Society of Artists was given an office and exhibit space in the [[Grace Nicholson]] Galleries, located at 46 North Los Robles Avenue.  However, the society eventually lost the space when the Nicholson gallery became the [[Pacific Asia Museum]].

== 1960s to Present ==
Despite the lack of a permanent exhibition space, the Society continued to attract professional artists, and to hold juried shows of its members works, often in venues outside the Pasadena city limits.

Today the Society continues to be operated entirely by the voluntary efforts of its artist members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14206">[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|The ''Pashupati seal'', showing a seated and possibly [[tricephalic]] figure, surrounded by animals.]]
{{Saivism}}
The '''Pashupati Seal''' is a [[steatite]] [[Impression seal|seal]] that was discovered at the [[Mohenjo-daro]] archaeological site of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly [[Three-headed|tricephalic]] (having three heads). It was once thought to be [[ithyphallic]], an interpretation that is now mostly discarded. He has a horned headdress and is surrounded by animals. He may represent a [[horned deity]].

It is purported to be one of the earliest depictions of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] ("[[Pashupati]]", meaning "lord of animals", is one of Shiva's [[Epithet|epithets]]) or [[Rudra]], who is associated with asceticism, [[yoga]], and [[linga]]; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads.  The figure has often been connected with the widespread motif of the [[Master of Animals]] found in ancient [[Near East]]ern and Mediterranean art, and the many other traditions of horned deities.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, Hope B., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art'', p. 270, 2006, A&amp;C Black, {{ISBN|0826419135}}, 9780826419132, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iBSDddO-9PoC&amp;pg=PA270 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and description==
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|A view of the Mohenjo-daro excavation site. The DK-G Area where the seal was found lies north-east of the [[Great Bath]] seen in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenoyer|first=Jonathan Mark|title=Mohenjo-daro: Introduction|url=http://www.mohenjodaro.net/mohenjodarointroduction.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201085754/http://www.mohenjodaro.net/mohenjodarointroduction.html|archivedate=2013-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The seal was uncovered in 1928-29, in Block 1, Southern Portion of the DK-G Area of Mohenjo-daro, at a depth of 3.9 meters below the surface.{{sfn|Mackay|1928-29|pp=74-75}} [[Ernest J. H. Mackay|E.J.H. Mackay]], who directed the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, and dated the seal to the Intermediate I Period (now considered to fall around 2350-2000 BCE) in his 1937-38 report in which the seal is numbered 420, giving it its alternate name.{{sfn|Mackay|1937-38|loc=plate XCIV; no. 420}}

[[File:Yogi. Mold of Seal, Indus valley civilization.jpg|thumb|An impression made from the steatite seal]]
The seal is formed of [[steatite]] and measures 3.56&amp;nbsp;cm by 3.53&amp;nbsp;cm, with a thickness of 0.76&amp;nbsp;cm. It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and facing forward. The legs of the figure are bent at the knees with the heels touching and the toes pointing downwards. The arms extend outwards and rest lightly on the knees, with the thumbs facing away from the body. Eight small and three large bangles cover the arms. The chest is covered with what appear to be necklaces, and a double band wraps around the waist. The figure wears a tall and elaborate headdress with central fan-shaped structure flanked by two large striated horns. The human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger to its one side, and a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other. Under the dais are two deer or ibexes looking backwards, so that their horns almost meet the center. At the top of the seal are seven [[Indus script|pictographs]], with the last apparently displaced downwards for lack of horizontal space.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=141}}{{sfn|Marshall|1931|p=52}}

==Identification with proto-Shiva==

===Marshall's analysis===
An early description and analysis of the seal's iconography was provided by archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] who had served as the Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and led the excavations of the Indus Valley sites. In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as [[ithyphallic]], while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] (or, his Vedic predecessor, [[Rudra]]), who also was known by the title [[Pashupati]] ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}} In a 1928&amp;ndash;29 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:
{{quote|My reasons for the identification are four. In the first place the figure has three faces and that Siva was portrayed with three as well as with more usual five faces, there are abundant examples to prove. Secondly, the head is crowned with the horns of a bull and the ''[[trishul (weapon)|trisula]]'' are characteristic emblems of Siva. Thirdly, the figure is in a typical yoga attitude, and Siva was and still is, regarded as a ''mahayogi''&amp;mdash;the prince of ''[[Yogi]]s''. Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the "Lord of Animals" (''Pasupati'')&amp;mdash;of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word ''pashu'', no less than that of domesticated cattle.{{sfn|Mackay|1928-29|pp=74-75}}}}
Later, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of ''[[linga]]'', and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}}{{sfn|McEvilley|pp=45-46}} Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis "has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism".{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}} Writing in 1976, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that "no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto-{{IAST|Śiva}} character of the seal has been accepted."{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76|p=47}} And [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] noted that, following Marshall's analysis, "nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|p=399}}

===Objections and alternate interpretations===
A lot of discussion has taken place about this seal.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"&gt;Bryant, Edwin, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections.&lt;ref&gt;See e. g. James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', vol. 2: N–Z. The Rosen Publishing Group, New York 2002, p. 633, who doubts the connection of the seal to Shiva, given the supposedly late age of the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]]  Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=180-181}} Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399-432}} However, Mahisha strikingly resembles Mahesha, an epithet of Shiva Pashupati, besides recalling his vehicle, or vahana Nandi, the bull. This seems to provide further evidence for the interpretation of the Pashupati seal as a proto-Shiva archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Chitgopekar, Nilima. ''Book of Durga.''  Penguin Books India, [2009] p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the  Vedic deities: [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], Mahisha, [[Varuna]], Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, [[Rishyasringa|Ŗșyaśŗnga]] (sage with horns) who is a contemporary of Dasarataand{{fact|date=June 2017}}; and  some non-aryan deities, including the unlikely Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"/&gt;

===Current opinion===
Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would "go too far."{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141-144}}

'''Picasso's African Period''', which was three years long, lasted from 1906 to 1909, was the period when [[Pablo Picasso]] painted in a style which was strongly influenced by [[African sculpture]] and particularly [[traditional African masks]]. This [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period following [[Picasso's Blue Period]] and [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose Period]] has also been called the Negro Period,&lt;ref&gt;Howells 2003, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; or Black Period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and period ==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|upright|This 19th-century [[Beti-Pahuin peoples|Fang]] mask is similar in style to what Picasso encountered in Paris just prior to ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''.]]
In the early 20th century, African artworks were being brought back to [[Paris]] museums in consequence of the expansion of the [[French colonial empire|French empire]] into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The press was abuzz with exaggerated stories of [[cannibalism]] and exotic tales about the African kingdom of [[Dahomey]]. The mistreatment of Africans in the [[Belgian Congo]] was exposed in  [[Joseph Conrad]]'s popular book ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. It was natural in this climate of African interest that Picasso would look towards African artworks as inspiration for some of his work; his interest was sparked by [[Henri Matisse]] who showed him a mask from the [[Gio people|Dan people]] of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse may have purchased this piece from Emile Heymenn's shop of non-western artworks in Paris, see [http://www.pablopicasso.org/africanperiod.jsp PabloPicasso.org].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May or June 1907, Picasso experienced a "revelation" while viewing [[African art]] at the [[ethnographic]] museum at [[Palais du Trocadéro]].&lt;ref&gt;Picasso, Rubin, and Fluegel 1980, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso's discovery of African art influenced the style of his painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (begun in May 1907 and reworked in July of that year), especially in the treatment of the two figures on the right side of the composition. 

Although ''Les Demoiselles'' is seen as a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-cubist]] work, Picasso continued to develop a style derived from African art  before beginning the [[analytic cubism]] phase of his painting in 1910. Other works of Picasso's African Period include the ''Bust of a Woman'' (1907, in the National Gallery, Prague); ''Mother and Child'' (Summer 1907, in the [[Musée Picasso]], Paris); ''Nude with Raised Arms'' (1907, in the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]], Madrid, Spain); and ''Three Women'' (Summer 1908, in the [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg).

''Made by Colin Torode, Lionheart replicas. Image by the Digital Pilgrim Project.''|alt=]]
'''Pilgrim badges''' were worn in the later [[medieval]] period by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] pilgrims. Typically made of lead alloy, they were sold as souvenirs at sites of [[Christian pilgrimage]] and bear imagery relating to the saint venerated there. The production of pilgrim badges flourished in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries, but declined after the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the mid-16th century. Tens of thousands have been found since the mid-19th century, predominantly in rivers. Together they form the largest corpus of medieval art objects to survive to us today.

Pilgrimage sites housed a saint's [[relic]]s: sometimes the whole body, sometimes a body part or significant object owned or touched by the saint. For example, St [[Thomas Becket]] was martyred at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England in 1170 and his body remained there, becoming the epicentre of an enormously popular cult. In 1220 it was translated into a costly shrine. The pilgrim souvenirs associated with his cult have a particularly diverse array of imagery, including that of his shrine, his head [[reliquary]] and scenes from his life. Other major sites that produced badges were [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]], [[Cologne Cathedral|Cologne]], Our Lady of Rocamadour and Jerusalem. Their badges bore images that were iconic and easily recognisable, such as the [http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_de_las_peregrinaciones/insignia_de_peregrino.html scallop shell], the [http://blog.museumoflondon.org.uk/journey-magi-three-kings-cologne-london/ Adoration of the Magi], the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49954&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39435&amp;plaA=39435-2-11&amp;page=8&amp;sortBy=&amp;view=list St Peter] or the [[Jerusalem cross|Jerusalem Cross]]. Shrines to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] were common all over Christendom, as are badges associable with her.[http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/29149.html] They often show her holding the Infant Christ, or represent the first letter of her name.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ampulla Menas Louvre AF7035.jpg|thumb|4th-7th century clay pilgrim flask or ampulla. Pilgrims used ampullae like this to carry water or oil from the pilgrimage site for Saint Menas: a late-third-century Egyptian Roman soldier who was martyred for his Christian faith. He is shown between the two camels who returned his body to Egypt for burial]]
Various cultural practices converged to bring about the pilgrim badge. Pilgrims had long sought natural souvenirs from their destination to commemorate their trip and bring home some of the site's sanctity. The earliest and still iconic pilgrim 'badge' was the scallop shell worn by pilgrims to the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Along with badges, vendors at holy sites sold [[ampulla]]e, small, tin vessels designed to carry holy water or oil from the site. The later metal examples derive from clay ampullae sold from the [[Early Middle Ages]] to pilgrims to the Holy Land and other sites in North Africa and the Middle East. These often bore images from the saint's life. The main vessel of the early ampullae from the shrine of St Thomas Becket is often textured to appear like a scallop shell, showing how flat, wearable signs and ampullae came to be conflated in the medieval imagination. Badges and ampullae were worn while travelling and allowed others to identify the wearer as a pilgrim and the saint they were visiting. They showed the wearer's special relationship with the saint and could be called upon in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Push me, pull you.

==Manufacture and use==
[[File:Medieval pilgrim badge (FindID 482380).jpg|thumb|A medieval cast lead alloy monogram of Maria pilgrim badge. The badge is in the shape of a Lombardic 'm' with crown above. The crown is formed of three projections; the two outer projections are trefoil and the central is a single collared knop. The outline of the 'm' has a beaded border and in the gaps between the columns of the 'm' the casting seam can be seen. The reverse of the badge is plain; the catchplate has survived intact but only the stump of the pin remains]]
Pilgrim badges were cheaply mass-produced in bronze, cuttle-bone or limestone [[Molding (process)|moulds]] or, less frequently, by [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]-stamping.[https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0|title=Digital Pilgrim 3D model of a Thomas Becket badge mould|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their easy reproducibility and modest media meant that everyone could afford them. British pilgrim badges often have an integral pin and clasp on the reverse whereas continental European badges more usually have sewing loops, but this is not a hard and fast rule. Pilgrims wore badges on their outer clothing and hats or around the neck to show where they had been on pilgrimage.  Some were designed to be fixed to the top of pilgrim staffs.[https://sketchfab.com/models/b7e217b5a8eb45f9b4c0ed64e2bff47e] Freshly cast, lead alloy is shiny and bright but it tarnishes rapidly.

To make thin, lead alloy badges, makers would have to create a eutectic alloy. Only at a specific ratio would lead and tin cast thin enough to make the most of the cheapest metal. The quality of pilgrim badges varied considerably, with some being naive and crudely made and others displaying great craftsmanship and skill. Ampullae, vessels for holy water or oil, were harder to make than badges, necessitating a process called [[Permanent mold casting|slush casting]]. Much rarer examples were made in precious metals for the wealthy; these have mostly been recycled for their valuable materials over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-RdiayZt0QEC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=pilgrim+badge+silver&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mkLkS-eGC5LWmQPB-JVN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pilgrim%20badge%20silver&amp;f=false Viewing Renaissance art]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later Middle Ages, thin, precious metal badges were being produced that were perfectly designed for being sewn into books. Manuscripts survive with badges still in them, or imprints on the pages where they once were.[https://www.kb.nl/en/themes/middle-ages/more-from-the-middle-ages/book-of-hours-with-pilgrim-badges] It is often possible to identify the shrine from the imprint. As artists became increasingly fascinated by illusionism or the [[Trompe-l'œil|trompe l'oeil]] technique, representations of pilgrim badges painted into the margins of prayer books appear.[http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/49/77004]

The most popular shrines sold over 100,000 badges a year, making pilgrim badges the first mass-produced tourist souvenir. In 1520, the church at Regensbury sold over 120,000 badges to medieval pilgrims, after a drastic shortage the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Medieval Pilgrimage|last=Taylor, Craig, Friedman, Izbicki, Tekippe (eds.)|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=522|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Today, most pilgrim badges are recovered in or near rivers. Lynn Museum in Norfolk has a large collection of medieval badges that were collected in the 19th century by children, whom the local antiquarian would pay for their finds.[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC095925][https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/assets/downloads/IS_arch_6_pilgrims_in_medieval_lincolnshire.pdf] It has been suggested that this is because medieval pilgrims believed that the badges would bring good luck if they were thrown into water, however that theory is now contested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/p/pilgrim_badge_depicting_st_geo.aspx Pilgrim badge depicting St George and the dragon in the] [[British Museum]]; J. Lee, Medieval pilgrims’ badges in rivers: the curious history of a non-theory, ''Journal of Art Historiography Number 11'' (2014) [https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pilgrim badges in the collection of [[The Salisbury Museum|Salisbury Museum]] were found when the town's medieval sewers were excavated. This, among other evidence, suggests they were eventually just thrown away.

== Imagery ==
[[File:Becket-pilgrim-badge.jpg|thumb|This badge represents the ornate head reliquary of St Thomas Becket and was probably sold near his shrine in Canterbury]]
Studying the imagery of pilgrim badges quickly leads to an ability to identify the shrine or saint associated with them. For example, [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas of Canterbury]] is often shown being martyred by one of a group of four knights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/7dd81a87e34644f3a0e50aaaf61cad44|title=3D model of a Canterbury pilgrim ampulla:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Scallop#Shell of Saint James|scallop shell associated with pilgrimages]] along the [[Way of St James]] to the shrine of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in modern Spain derived from shells collected by pilgrims on the beach. The relic of [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]]'s head, which was famously venerated at Amiens, is shown as a face on a plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e761b7bbfac94c1d9c49b55e46586fb1|title=3D model of an Amiens pilgrim souvenir:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images are frequentlty related to iconographic types found on monumental artwork, showing how mobile iconographies were across media and social spheres.

Badges were made in the Middle Ages for purposes beyond pilgrim souvenirs; [[livery badge]]s were presented to employees and allies by great figures, and became highly controversial in the decades leading to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  Some political badges have survived, including a fine one for the [[Black Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/f/funerary_badge_black_prince.aspx British Museum badge of the Black Prince]

&lt;/ref&gt;  Other badges, with motifs such as lovers' tokens and mini brooches, were perhaps a form of cheap jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e8644b481aa7494d92c9ce9c9998b9c9|title=3D model of a medieval lover's token inscribed 'Herte be Trewe'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erotic badges showing winged phalluses or vulvas dressed as pilgrims are prolific, although their cultural significance is still debated.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49050&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=phallus+medieval+badge+&amp;page=1] Gazing at a collection of pilgrim souvenirs and medieval badges is to gain an insight into the visual world of medieval Christendom.

In England the tradition of making and wearing pilgrim badges died out in the early 16th century as pilgrimage initially declined in popularity and was then banned completely as the country became [[Protestantism|Protestant]] during the [[English Reformation]], when pilgrimage became regarded as a [[superstition]] and [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. However, the tradition continued in Catholic Europe, in some cases to the present day.

A film '''Production Office''' is the administrative office responsible for managing a [[film production]]. The office is responsible to the [[film producer|Film Producer]] and includes the [[production manager|Production Manager]], [[Assistant director|Assistant Director]] and one or more [[Production assistant|Production Assistants]]. Typically a ''Production Office'' is established in the [[pre-production]] phase and continues until at least [[post-production]].

The Production Office usually includes positions such as, but not entirely made of, Production Supervisor, Production Office Coordinator, Assistant Production Office Coordinator, Production Secretary and Office Assistants (otherwise known or credited as Office PA's or Staff Assistants).

A Production Office will look different for each production depending on many variables including the type of film, the production company producing the film and the size of the budget of the film itself. A Production Office can be as small as one or two people (mostly seen in an independent film structure) or as big as ten or more on a film with a sizeable budget.

''''Senior theatre'''' is a form of [[drama]] designed specifically for older adults, where [[Old age|senior]]s are actively involved.

In 1999, there were 79 companies in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg Bonnie L. (1999), "Senior Theatre Connections", Portland OR, USA, ArtAge Publications&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, there are over 800 groups with many around the world.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Aging Well Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theatre performers want to be on stage when they are older. A good number have never acted before, others have performed when they were young and want to do it again. Some have acted all their lives and they know the joy of performing.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Aging Well Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Seniors have time to explore the theatre.

== Different types of Senior Theatre ==
There are many different types of Senior Theatre including acting classes, [[live theatre]] viewing, play reading, [[improvisation]], [[storytelling]] or theatre productions that are readers theatre, short plays, variety shows, plays from life stories of participants, [[musical theatre]], and topics facing seniors, among others.

Offstage, seniors also work as solo performers, playwrights, or they act in films and commercials. Many help backstage, as ushers, or in the box office. They also take classes in all elements of theatre in colleges, universities, and in the community.

== Techniques of Senior Theatre ==
Senior Theatre uses techniques that accommodate the abilities of older adults.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Aging Well Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular techniques in the field are readers theatre and script-in-hand performances. They allow actors to have easy access to their lines and blocking without having to be concerned about the fear of forgetting. Also, Senior Theatre can be intergenerational by including actors of all ages on stage or in the audience.

== Benefits ==
Performers range from professional to amateur in both rural and urban settings. Ages usually span between 50 and 90 years but most are in their late 60's and 70's.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Aging Well Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; There are many benefits derived from Senior Theatre including physical, mental, psychological, social, and cultural growth. It builds vital social connections for often isolated seniors.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Aging Well Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvisation as a means to create intergenerational communication ==

In theater, it is often difficult for people over the age of 50 to get an opportunity to perform. In Improv where casts rely heavily on comfortable communication, it can be difficult for older people to be accepted. One way of overcoming this problem is for older improvisers to create "over 50" troupes who create their own opportunities to perform. It is especially helpful for cross generational culture if these troupes also seek out active involvement with improvisers of younger generations. Two examples of such troupes are Elderberry Jam Improv and New Tricks. 

 Elderberry Jam Improv billed as "World's Finest Vintage Improv is based in Cambridge Massachusetts. The ensemble includes Ann "Crim" Crimmins, Dave Stern, Hilary Fabre, Eric V. Fields, David Silberman, Miki Manting and Joan Larason. 

NEW TRICKS,founded in 2003,has been described as "the fine wine of improv" and was the first over 50 improv troupe in New England. Troupe members like to boast about their over 462 years (at least) of experience. New Tricks was founded by the late Mike Martin &amp; Jeanne Hillson. Longtime members include: Bari Olevsky,Don Buell,Amy Rubin, Joan Larason &amp; Lanny Rubin.

In the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece]] and [[classical drama]], the '''''skene''''' was the structure at the back of a theatre stage.The word skene means "tent" or "hut," and it is thought that the original structure for these purposes was a tent or light building of wood, and was a [[temporary structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadman, 168&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a very light structure or just cloth hanging from a rope, but over the course of time the skene underwent fundamental changes. First it became a permanent building, whose roof could sometimes be used to make speeches and as time passed it was raised up from the level of the orchestra, creating a proskenion, or "space in front of the ''skene''".  The facade of the proskenion was behind the orchestra, and provided a space for supporting stage scenery. During the Roman Period the skene had become a large and complex, elaborately decorated, stone building on several levels. Actors emerged from the skene and could use its steps and balconies to speak from.  It was also where costumes were stored and to which the [[periaktoi]] (painted panels serving as the background) were connected.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;
== Classical Greece ==
Ancient Greek theatre began in the 6th century B.C. and traces its origins to religious rituals such as the Festival of Dionysus and choral odes to the gods known as dithyrambs. Early Greek theaters were simple open air structures built on the slope of a hill. The Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus in Athens is thought to have been the first purpose-built theatre. Around the middle of the 5th century B.C. the skene began to appear in Greek Theatre. Placing a skene behind the ''orchestra'' where the performers acted, played, and danced broke what is thought to have been the original [[theatre in the round]] nature of Greek theatre.  The skene also served as another "hidden stage." At times some of the action went on inside, in which case it was up to the audience to decide what was happening based on the noises coming from the inside.  It was a convention of the dramas of the classic period that characters never died on stage, instead usually retreating into the skene to do so.

"At some point at Athens in the classical period a small stoa colonnade was constructed behind the scene-building with its back to the theater and would have provided a permanent backdrop for the action."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama|last=Storey|first=Ian|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|location=Malden, MA|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hellenistic Period ==
The Hellenistic period started around the time of Alexander the Great's death in 323 B.C. and lasted until the Roman Victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C. As Ancient Greece began to change from a culture consisting of ethnic and city-state Greeks to one governed by large monarchies, theatre architecture to include the stage buildings began to experience significant changes. In the 4th century B.C. the Skene became a permanent stone structure and the stage was raised off the ground. In surviving examples this stage seems to have been raised by 2.43 m to 3.96 m above the orchestra, and to have been from 1.92 m to 3.96 m deep, terminated by the skene.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Greek chorus]] declined in importance compared to a smaller group of main actors, the chorus remained in the orchestra to perform, while the main actors generally performed from the stage on top of the proskenion. This important change occurred in the [[Hellenistic period]], between the 3rd and 1st century BC.  The skene itself became increasingly elaborate, and was also available as a place for actors to declaim from, so that the performers between them had three levels available. "The roof of the skene was called the ''theologian'' ("god-speaking"), from which one might assume that its primary use was for the advent of deities, either at the start or close of the drama."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Most theaters still standing today date from the Hellenistic period.   

== Roman Period ==
In [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]], [[scaenae frons]] ("facade of the skene") is the term for the elaborately decorated stone screens, rising two or three stories, that the skene had now become. By the 1st century BC, the skene was as elaborate as its Roman development which dispensed with the orchestra altogether, leaving a relatively low ''proscaenium'' facade, often decorated, and a wide stage or ''pulpitum'' behind, ending in an elaborate scaenae frons with three or more doors, and sometimes three stories.  The evolution of the [[actor]], who assumed an individual part and answered to the chorus (the word for actor, hypokrites, means answerer), introduced into drama a new form, the alternation of acted scenes, or [[episode]]s. The skene no longer supported painted sets in the Greek manner but relied for effect on elaborate permanent architectural decoration and consisted of a series of complex stone buildings. To each side there was a ''paraskenion''.  The ''episkenion'' was the upper floor of the skene, which might be deepened to give a third stage level, seen through ''thyromata'' or openings.  The interior of the ''logeion'' ("building") behind the skene facade remained normally outside the view of the audience, and fulfilled the original function as a changing room and place for props.

[[Image:Spookhill.jpg|thumb|right|Spook Hill in [[Lake Wales, Florida]]. One of central [[Florida]]'s lesser known and older attractions.]]

'''Spook Hill''' is a [[gravity hill]], an [[optical illusion]] where cars appear to roll up the spooky hill in [[Lake Wales, Florida]].

Spook Hill is located on the [[Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge|Lake Wales Ridge]], a [[geology|geologically]] significant range of sand and [[limestone]] hills, which were islands from two to three million years ago, when [[sea level]]s were much higher than at present.

The attraction is adjacent to Spook Hill Elementary School, which adopted [[Casper The Friendly Ghost]] as their school mascot. The attraction is also in close proximity to [[Bok Tower Gardens|Bok Tower]].

Spook Hill received national media attention when an article about it appeared on the front page of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on October 25, 1990, and it was featured in a segment on ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Charles Osgood]] on November 5, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabayskeptics.org/Spook_Hill.html Tampa Bay Skeptics: Do cars really roll up Spook Hill?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Workshop was founded in 1937 following the dissolution of the [[Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios]] (LEAR, Revolutionary Writers’ and Artists’ League), a group of artists who had supported the goals of the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Initially called the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular, its founders built off a rich tradition of printmaking in Mexico, particularly the legacy of [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]].

Under President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], the work of the Taller supported the government's policies, including the [[Mexican oil expropriation]].

In 1940, muralist [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] launched an armed assault on the residence of exiled [[Russian Revolution]]ary [[Leon Trotsky]], using the Taller's print shop as a headquarters and including some artists affiliated with the Taller in his squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate =2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some collaboration between the TGP and the artists of the [[New Deal]]-era [[Works Progress Administration]], including [[Rafael Tufiño]].

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Chicano]] and [[African American art]]ists such as [[Elizabeth Catlett]] produced work at the Taller. The Taller became inspiration to many politically active leftist artists; for example, American expressionist painter [[Byron Randall]] went on to found similar artist collectives after becoming an associate member.&lt;ref&gt;Makin, Jean, ed.

The TGP faced financial instability and had to relocate several times, but [[Jesús Alvarez Amaya]] kept it running up to his death in 2010.

==Work==
During its heyday, the Taller specialized in linoleum prints and woodcuts. It produced posters, handbills, banners, and portfolio editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate =2009-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art supported causes such as [[anti-militarism]], [[organized labor]], and [[antifascism|opposition to fascism]].
 
The art was often made through the collaborative process, and the Taller took the anti-commercial policy of not numbering prints, but it sold prints as part of and was the first political publishing workshop in Mexico to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Under the brand ''La Estampa Mexicana'', the TGP sold song lyrics, posters of heroes and Mexican culture and Left movements worldwide, and gave rise to a new generation of ''calaveras'', the Mexican tradition of humorous poetry ridiculing politicians and other popular figures. The [[raised fist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html Mexican posters on social and educational themes]&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as a graphic symbol of resistance and unity.

It still working on art and social issues and it is located in Dr. Villada 46, Colonia Doctores, [[Mexico City]].

'''''The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Michael Lewis]] about the build-up of the [[United States housing bubble]] during the 2000s. The book was released on March 15, 2010, by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]. It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]], and was the basis for a 2015 [[The Big Short (film)|film of the same name]].

==Summary==
''The Big Short'' describes several of the main players in the creation of the [[credit default swap]] market that sought to bet against the [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO) [[economic bubble|bubble]] and thus ended up profiting from the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. The book also highlights the eccentric nature of the type of person who bets against the market or goes against the grain.

The work follows people who believed the bubble was going to burst, like [[Meredith Whitney]], who predicted the demise of [[Citigroup]] and [[Bear Stearns]]; [[Steve Eisman]], an outspoken [[hedge fund]] manager; [[Greg Lippmann]], a [[Deutsche Bank]] trader; Eugene Xu, a [[quantitative analyst]] who created the first CDO market by matching buyers and sellers; the founders of [[Cornwall Capital]], who started a hedge fund in their garage with $110,000 and built it into $120&amp;nbsp;million when the market crashed; and [[Michael Burry]], an ex-[[neurologist]] who created [[Scion Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, [http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 Betting on the Blind Side"], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also highlights some people involved in the biggest losses created by the market crash: like [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill]]'s $300 million mezzanine CDO manager Wing Chau; [[Howie Hubler]], known as the person who lost $9&amp;nbsp;billion in one trade, the largest single loss in history;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler "Stories on Howie Hubler"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823043941/http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler |date=August 23, 2010 }}, ''[[The New York Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Cassano]]'s [[AIG Financial Products]], which suffered over $99&amp;nbsp;billion in losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29455792/ "U.S. offers more funds to help fraught AIG: $30 billion more in loans; $61.7 billion lost in the fourth quarter"], [[MSNBC]], March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was shortlisted for the 2010 [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|''Financial Times'' and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]]. It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} non-fiction bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/2010/2010-10-10.pdf|title=The New York Times Bestseller List|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It also received the 2011 [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFK Center Book Awards|url=http://rfkcenter.org/who-we-are/awards/rfk-book-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thalia''''' is a c.1546 painting by [[Michele Pannonio]], signed by the artist and produced for the 'studiolo' in Belfiore, begun by [[Lionello d'Este]] in 1447 and completed by his brother Borso in 1463. After the palace's destruction by fire in 1632 its paintings were dispersed - ''Thalia'' is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Budapest. 

Long misidentified as [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], the work is one of the few known works by the artist, active in [[Ferrara]] but of Hungarian origins.

'''''The Vision of a Knight''''', also called '''''The Dream of Scipio''''' or '''''Allegory''''', is a small [[egg tempera]] painting on [[Populus|poplar]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], finished in 1504–1505.&lt;ref name=Thones&gt;Thoenes, Christof, Raphael (2005) Ed. Taschen. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Girardi&gt;Girardi, Monica, Raffaello. La ricerca della perfezione e la tenerezza della natura (1999) Ed. Associati. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in [[London]].  It probably formed a pair with the [[Three Graces (Raphael)|Three Graces]] panel, also 17&amp;nbsp;cm square, now in the [[Château de Chantilly]] museum.

There are a number of theories as to what the panel is intended to represent.  Some art historians think the sleeping knight  represents the Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]] (236&amp;ndash;184 BC) who dreamed that he had to choose between Virtue (behind whom is a steep and rocky path) and Pleasure (in looser robes). However, the two feminine figures are not presented as contestants. They may represent the ideal attributes of the knight: the book, sword and flower which they hold suggest the ideals of scholar, soldier and lover which a knight should combine.

The most likely source for the allegory depicted is from a passage in the [[Punica (poem)|Punica]], an epic poem recounting the [[Second Punic War]] by the Latin poet [[Silius Italicus]].&lt;ref name="raphael's iconography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/iconography |title=Iconography &amp;#124; Studying Raphael &amp;#124; Research &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel was moved to England by [[William Young Ottley]] in 1800.

Raphael used an extensive palette of paints to depict this colourful scene.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pigments such as [[lead-tin-yellow|lead-tin yellow]], [[ultramarine]], [[verdigris]] and [[ochres]] have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, [http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-an-allegory/ An Allegory (Vision of a Knight)], illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;
