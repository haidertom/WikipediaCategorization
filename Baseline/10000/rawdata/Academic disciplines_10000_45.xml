'''''A View of Religions''''' is an 18th-century comprehensive survey of world religions by the American author, [[Hannah Adams]]. First published in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1784, it was a pioneering work in that it represented denominations from the perspective of their adherents, without imposing Adams' own preferences. The book was divided into sections and passed through several editions, which included minor changes in the name of the work. It was reprinted in England.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=14}} ''A View of Religions'' was Adams' first and principal literary work. It was the result of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. She began thinking on the subject after reading a manuscript from [[Thomas Broughton (writer)|Thomas Broughton]]'s ''Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times'' (1742).{{sfn|Adams|1817|p=1}}

==Development==
[[File:Hannah Adams BostonAthenaeum.png|thumb|left|Hannah Adams]]
Until she was twenty years of age, Adams's reading had been limited mostly to works of imagination and feeling. She had never been directed to those of a controversial nature, nor to a study of the disputed points between the various sects. Her curiosity being awakened by a small manuscript from Broughton's ''Dictionary'', giving an account of some of the most common of the religious denominations, she began to read all she could find on the subject. At about the age of 30,{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}} becoming disgusted with the intolerance and lack of candor of the authors, she decided to write in a blank book what seemed to her to be the truth. In doing this she had no idea of publication. The work grew upon her hands and became known to her friends. Needing money, she was urged to publish it. But to find a printer to take it without immediate pay was the difficulty. She obtained 395 subscribers, 28 of whom were women, including Rev. [[Nathaniel Emmons]], [[Franklin, Massachusetts]] (six copies), Rev. [[Charles Chauncy (1705–1787)|Charles Chauncy]], D. D., Boston, Dr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], president of [[Rhode Island College]], [[Edmund Quincy (1703–1788) |Edmund Quincy]], Esq., Hon. Oliver Wendell, [[Nathaniel Appleton]], Esq., and [[Samuel Adams]], all of Boston.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} The hard study and close reflection were so difficult, that she was attacked before she finished it by a severe fit of illness, and threatened with derangement.{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}}

==1784 edition==
[[File:An alphabetical compendium of the various sects (1784).png|thumb|''An alphabetical compendium of the various sects'' (1784)]]
A bargain having been made with the printer, the book appeared in 1784. Its motto is, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good." In the Advertisement at the beginning, the author says she intends to "avoid giving the least preference of one denomination above another, to give a few arguments of the principal sects from their own authors as far as possible, to endeavor to represent every sect, and be very careful to enter into the spirit of each author."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

The condition of public opinion is seen when Thomas Prentiss, pastor of the Congregational Church in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]], in the Preface, felt obliged to say:—{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} {{quote|text="The world has been absurdly accustomed to entertain but a moderate opinion of female abilities, and to associate their pretended productions to the craft and policy of designing men; either to excite their admiration or screen their weakness from censure; whereas unbiassed reason must allow, if an invidious comparison between the sexes is in any respect justifiable, it cannot be grounded upon a defect of natural ability, but upon the different and perhaps faulty mode of female education; for under similar culture and with equal advantages, it is far from being certain that the female mind would not admit a measure of improvement that would at least equal, and perhaps in many instances eclipse, the boasted glory of the other Her father, with his other children, was living with a married son, to whom the home and property had been made over. Not wishing to add to the burden of her brother's increasing family expenses, Hannah found this the most trying time of her life, when, as she said, " it was a struggle to live." But though feeble in health, dependent upon herself for support, more or less alone in the world, she found in work her only remedy. She began to prepare additions for the second edition of her book. The task being completed, she applied to some printers for terms of publication. "Though," she says, "I wrote nearly the same letter to all, consisting of a few direct questions, their answers were generally various, prolix and ambiguous." She finally accepted an offer of one hundred dollars in books for an edition of one thousand copies. Going to Boston to attend to the matter, a friend introduced her to the Rev. James Freeman, the newly ordained pastor of King's Chapel. He became interested, transacted the business with the printer, John West Folsom, and helped her obtain some new subscribers. For this generous, personal assistance in a time of need, Adams was most grateful to the end of her life.}}

==1791 edition==
In 1791, appeared under the title of ''A View of Religions'', the second edition of her book first published seven years before. It was enlarged to 410 pages. Part First treated of nearly 300 different religious denominations which had appeared from the beginning of the Christian era; Part Second, of the worship of the Grand Lama, of Mahometans, Jews, Deists and Sceptics, followed by a short review of the religions of the people of the habitable world. A discriminating judgment was noticeable in the work. This second edition was dedicated to [[John Adams]], then [[Vice President of the United States]], a name, she said, "which excites the veneration and gratitude of fellow-citizens, the admiration and esteem of foreign nations."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Of the 400 subscribers to this second edition, 82 of whom were clergymen and 16 women, John Adams headed the list with three copies. [[Samuel Adams]], lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, followed. Among the new names gained were those of [[John Hancock]], of Boston; [[Joseph Willard]], D. D., president of [[Harvard College]]; Right Rev. [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Caroll]], D. D., Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; Hon. [[William Bradford (Rhode Island)|William Bradford]], [[governor of Rhode Island]]; Rev. [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]; [[Christopher Gore]], Esq., Boston; [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]], Boston; Rev. Adoniram Judson, Sr., [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]; Hon. Benjamin Greenleaf, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]; and many others. Mr. [[Moses Brown]], of [[Providence, Rhode Island |Providence]], took fifteen copies, and seven of the subscribers took six each.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Such distinguished names spoke well of Adams's literary ability. The book was pronounced the best of the kind ever written, possibly the first. From its profits, Adams was enabled to pay the debts her sister's illness had contracted, and to put a small sum at interest. In its sale, her father, who was called by the townspeople "Book Adams," was of much help. On horseback, with his saddle-bag full of the books, often reading a volume, he went from place to place, to sell or to distribute them. Of decided literary tastes himself, he was never happier than when making his frequent visits to the library of Harvard College. Once, upon entering it, he lifted up both hands and exclaimed in great earnestness, "I'd rather be librarian of Harvard College than Emperor of all the Russias!" Who knows but that if Thomas Adams could have followed out his early desires, he might have been librarian of Harvard College? Circumstances obliged him to go into business, and he made a failure of it.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

After the publication of the second edition of her book, Adams taught school.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1804 edition==
[[File:A View of Religions (Third edition, 1801).png|thumb|''A View of Religions'' (1801)]]
Two years after the publication of Adams's ''History of New England from the first settlement at Plymouth to the acceptance of the Federal Constitution'', ''A view of religions, in two parts : Part I. Containing an alphabetical compedium of the various religious denominations, which have appeared in the world, from the beginning of the Christian era to the present day. Part II. Containing a brief account of the different schemes of religion now embraced among mankind '' was published, enlarged, and dedicated as before to John Adams. Through the continued kindness of Rev. James Freeman, a bargain was made with the printer whereby she was to receive five hundred dollars in yearly payments, covering a certain period, for the edition of two thousand copies. In 1804 appeared her book of nearly four hundred pages called " Truth and Excellence of the Christian Religion." Her selection of authors and the extracts from their works reveal good judgment and a wide survey of general literature. Not being able to purchase or borrow all the books she needed for this effort, she spent some time in Boston, in order to visit the booksellers' shops. In such places much of the work, as well as the additions to the third edition of her first book, was written. Adams gave this work, with its four hundred subscribers, to the printer for one hundred dollars in books.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1805 edition==
''A View of Religions, in three Parts : Part I. Containing an Alphabetical Compendium of the Denominations among Christians. Part II. Containing a brief Account of Paganism, Mahomedism, Judaism, and Deism. Part III. Containing a View of the Religious of the different Nations of the World. By Hannah Adams. A new Edition, with Corrections and Additions. To which is prefixed, An Essay on Truth, by Andrew Fuller.''  was published in 1805. Griffiths &amp; Griffiths commented:—{{sfn|Griffiths|Griffiths|1807|p=217-}} {{quote|text=The Dictionary appears to be compiled with much fairness; and it contains a long article on the Friends or Quakers, on which peculiar care has been bestowed. To such as are desirous of becoming acquainted with the credenda of this church, the particulars here inserted will be interesting, especially as they are exhibited for the purpose of obviating the representation given by Mr. Evans in his “Sketch of Denominations,” of the similarity of their principles to Sociaianism. The evidence of Barclay is quoted, to prove that the Quakers, while they admit the Scriptures to be of divine authority, do not esteem them “the principal ground of truth, nor the primary rule of faith, but only a secondary rule, subordinate to the spirit.” In the 2d and 3d parts of this work, the reader will meet with curious and amusing accounts of the different religions that now prevail in the several quarters and subdivisions of the globe; and which concludes with stating that the extent of the Christian religion, compared with the parts overspread with Paganism and Mahometanism, is as five to twenty-five.}}

==1817 edition==
[[File:A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations, Jewish, Heathen ... (1817).png|thumb|''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'']]
In 1817 appeared ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'', dedicated as before to John Adams. This was a popular book from the first. It was published in England with a preface and additions by Mr. Andrew Fuller; also in another form by Mr. Thomas Williams, who likewise made alterations. Adams acknowledged herself indebted to both these editions for some of the improvements in her fourth edition. It received the notice of Jared Sparks in the North American Review; he pronounced it the best manual of the kind he knew of. "It has the peculiar merit," he added, "of the strictest candor and impartiality; and so completely has the author divested herself of all in lividual prepossessions, that it may be doubted whether from a single passage in the whole work her own religious sentiments can be inferred. This freedom from personal bias, in exhibiting the views of others, especially on topics rarely touched without calling out private opinion, inspires confidence in her statements, as well as respect for her judgment and Christian charity."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

'''Abdul Aziz bin Ali al-Harbi''' is a [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[Islamic scholar]] and associate professor at [[Umm al-Qura University]] in [[Mecca]]. He is one of the founders and the current president of the Arabic Language Academy at Mecca.&lt;ref name="Harbi"&gt;[http://www.m-a-arabia.com/site/4473.html أ.د / عبد العزيز بن علي الحربي ]. Official website of the Academy, 9 February 2015. Accessed 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A native of Mecca, Harbi [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] the entirety of the [[Qur'an]], the Muslim holy book, at the age of eleven.&lt;ref name=cover&gt;Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Harbi, ''Tawjih mushkil al-qira`at al-'ashariya al-farashiya lughatan wa tasfiran wa i'raban'', back cover. 1st. ed. [[Riyadh]]: Dar Ibn Hazm, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbi earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]], known to Muslims as [[Tafsir]], from [[Islamic University of Madinah]] in 1989.

==Program of studies==
The Academy's curriculum is not unified, and does not operate according to built-in program. Each student selects her/his personal curriculum, consulted by the faculty, reflecting one's proclivities and abilities. The Academy's program is varied in acting and performance methods and styles, attempting to expose the students to a large variety of approaches to theatre and film performance and become, as much as possible, a multi-styled creators and performers. Thus many of the Academy's classes aim both as training workshops as well as performance targeted, leading to a final project finally performed in front of internal or external audience. 
In addition to the regular curriculum, the Academy operates the Academy Theatre which regularly mounts productions of professional standards, involving professional actors, some of whom are the Academy graduates and others graduates of other schools. The Academy also holds public discussions and lectures on cultural and artistic matters, and the Academy bar hosts musical programs and small scale shows. Assembled from donations from various sources, the Academy has one of the largest theatre and culture library in Tel Aviv, and in 2015 the Gideon Tamir reading corner was inaugurated, for the use of students, faculty and the general public.

==Academic degree==
The Academy of Performing Arts, Tel Aviv is not recognized as a higher education institution conferring degrees, yet it collaborates with the Israeli Open University of which it is an official study centre (no. 698). Each semester, according to demand, several classes of the Open University are given, tutored by the faculty of the Open University. Students who graduated from the Academy of Performing Arts, provided they have completed the full curriculum of the Academy, are entitled to apply for recognition of several credits from the studies towards a bachelor's degree. The recommended regular  curriculum of each of the Academy's six semesters consists of at least 20 weekly hours of the Academy classes, plus optional 2 classes from the studies of the open University, all to be selected from the choice of classes offered that semester. 
In addition to the three years full program of studies, the Academy holds shorter programs designed to enable completion of studies for students who studied partial studies at other recognized schools of drama, while recognizing the classes studied in the former frameworks as parts of them full program. Also, the Academy holds on demand basic preparatory programs for students who would like to be admitted later for full programs of studies, whether in the Academy itself or elsewhere.

==Alpha 13 Festival==

As of summer 2017 the Academy theatre has launched the Alpha 13 annual festival, to be held every year celebrating the end of the summer, including a prize competition of stage performances, house and guest productions, as well as music and film events. The 2017 festival consisted of 5 competition shows (selected by an artistic committee from about 30 applying groups and artists), 4 house productions, 7 guest shows and 4 special events of music and film. Most of these shows and events first opened in the festival, and others had their Tel Aviv debut during the four weeks of the festival. The festival major theme was "languages": a frivolous, festive and undisciplined variety of semantic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic and English), of performance styles, and of artistic genres.

==Theatre productions==
Over the years the repertory of the Academy theatre consisted of a variety of shows, covering various areas of theatre and performance. Some of the most successful shows were ''Split Screen'', a combined intertwined dramatization of short stories by Israeli poet Dalia Rabikowitz and Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]; [[Commedia dell'Arte]] adaptations of [[Carlo Goldoni]]'s ''Military Lover'' and Leon Katz' ''The Three Cuckolds'';  ''Krum''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKqxBsxuc4 (Excerpts)] and ''Heffets'' by [[Hanoch Levin]]; [[Federico García Lorca]]'s ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFbsGCxlYUc (Excerpts)]; [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7wzoZx0pmw (Excerpts)]; [[Sarah Daniels]]' ''Neaptide''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAV1eri-bgw (Excerpts)] ''Woyzeck'' by [[Büchner]]; [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' and ''[[Mountain Language]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mUFhoyC6i0 (Excerpts)]; ''Good'' by C. P. Taylor [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX8VUhowpeY (Who by Fire by Leonard Cohen, Hebrew lyrics by Avraham Oz, musical arrangement by Yuval Messner, from the production of ''Good'' at the Academy Theatre)]; Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUR2FLbMYgU (Jessica's departure, to the lyrics of Serge Reggiani's Ma fille)]; Pam Gems' ''Dusa, Fish, Vy, Stas'' (in Arabic); ''Back River'' by Rachel Shalita; ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' by [[Paul Zindel]], [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s ''[[Beautiful Thing (play)|Beautiful Thing]]'', and many others, as well as "playlects" ("play cum lecture"), such as Avraham Oz and his players performing and discussing love, courtship and marriage in Shakespeare [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMF4K1M0Yc (Oz and players in Shakespeare playlect)].

'''Artificial neural membrane''' ('''ANM''') refers to a new class of functional structure developed through research adaptive and evolutionary neural networks and programmable materials.  The greatest interest in ANM structures surround their potential as [[open architecture]] environments for the integration of [[Micrometre|microscale]] and [[Nanometre|nanoscale]] devices.

Originally based on the [[Neurogenesis]] Algorithms developed by [[mathematician]] and engineering [[physicist]] Dr. P. A. Menges.  While working as a postdoctoral research associate at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], Dr. Menges became interested in thin film materials used in specialized sensors also referred to as smart skins.  After leaving the laboratory she established a computational method allowing networks to automatically embed or simulate on other networks based in functional materials. 

Artificial neural membrane technology development has been funded by the [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts, for application to flapping wing flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/abstracts/1121Menges.pdf |title=ARTIFICIAL NEURAL MEMBRANE FLAPPING WING |first=Pamela |last=Menges }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently [[Aerospace Research Systems, Inc]] – the agency that pioneered work in developing artificial neurons for use in control of multifunctional smart structures – is applying the technology to reusable launch vehicles.  Other applications include [[biotechnology]] processes, morphing aircraft and spacecraft, adaptive [[wind turbine|wind generators]], and [[artificial organ]]s.  Recent research also indicates that ANM systems may provide the first truly automated intentional or conceptual programming environment.  The ANM technology has been referred as being as significant as [[semiconductors]] in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

      <comment>Disambiguated: [[propositional constant]] → [[Logical constant]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5707">'''Basic fuzzy Logic''' (or shortly '''BL'''), the logic of [[continuous function|continuous]] [[t-norm]]s, is one of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]]. It belongs to the broader class of [[substructural logic]]s, or logics of [[residuated lattice]]s;&lt;ref name="Ono"&gt;Ono (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; it extends the logic of all left-continuous t-norms [[Monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]].

== Syntax ==

=== Language ===

The language of the propositional logic BL consists of [[countable|countably]] many [[propositional variable]]s and the following primitive [[logical connective]]s:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]])
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (binary). The sign &amp;amp; is a more traditional notation for strong conjunction in the literature on fuzzy logic, while the notation &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; follows the tradition of substructural logics.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]] — a [[Logical constant|propositional constant]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL).
The following are the most common defined logical connectives:
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). Unlike [[Monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]] and weaker substructural logics, weak conjunction is definable in BL as
::&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B \equiv A \otimes (A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: As in MTL, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \otimes (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;

[[Well-formed formula]]e of BL are defined as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

=== Axioms ===

A [[Hilbert-style deduction system]] for BL has been introduced by [[Petr Hájek]] (1998). Its single derivation rule is [[modus ponens]]:
:from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; derive &lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt;
The following are its [[axiom scheme|axiom schemata]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}
  {\rm (BL1)}\colon &amp; (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow C)) \\
  {\rm (BL2)}\colon &amp; A \otimes B \rightarrow A\\
  {\rm (BL3)}\colon &amp; A \otimes B \rightarrow B \otimes A\\
  {\rm (BL4)}\colon &amp;  A \otimes (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B \otimes (B \rightarrow A)\\
  {\rm (BL5a)}\colon &amp;  (A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)) \rightarrow (A \otimes B \rightarrow C)\\
  {\rm (BL5b)}\colon &amp;  (A \otimes B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C))\\
  {\rm (BL6)}\colon &amp;  ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow C) \rightarrow C)\\
  {\rm (BL7)}\colon &amp;  \bot \rightarrow A
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms (BL2) and (BL3) of the original axiomatic system were shown to be redundant (Chvalovský, 2012) and (Cintula, 2005). All the other axioms were shown to be independent (Chvalovský, 2012).
== Semantics ==

Like in other propositional [[t-norm fuzzy logics]], [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for BL, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which the logic is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''BL-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]]
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' BL-algebras — that is, all BL-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]]
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' BL-algebras — that is, all BL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order; they are uniquely determined by the function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any continuous [[t-norm]]

'''Behavioural sciences''' explore the cognitive processes within [[organism]]s and the behavioural interactions between organisms in the natural world. It involves the systematic analysis and investigation of [[human]] and [[animal]] behavior through the study of the past, controlled and [[naturalistic observation]] of the present, and disciplined scientific [[experimentation]] and [[Conceptual model|modeling]]. It attempts to accomplish legitimate, objective conclusions through rigorous formulations and observation.&lt;ref name= "Klemke"&gt;Klemke, E. D., Hollinger, R., and Kline, A. D., (1980), Introduction to the book in 'Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science': Buffalo, New York, Prometheus Books p 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of behavioral sciences include [[psychology]], [[psychobiology]], [[anthropology]], and [[cognitive science]]. Generally, behavior science deals primarily with human action and often seeks to generalize about human behavior as it relates to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Categories==
Behavioural sciences includes two broad categories: neural — ''Information sciences'' and social — ''Relational sciences''.

Information processing sciences deals with [[information processing]] of stimuli from the social environment by cognitive entities in order to engage in decision making, social judgment and social perception for individual functioning and survival of organism in a social environment. These include [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[psychobiology]], [[biological neural network|neural networks]], [[social cognition]], [[social psychology]], [[semantic networks]], [[ethology]], and [[social neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/behavioral-sciences.html|title=What are behavioral sciences? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Relational sciences deals with relationships, interaction, communication networks, associations and relational strategies or dynamics between organisms or cognitive entities in a social system. These include fields like [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological social psychology]], [[social networks]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[agent-based model]] and  [[microsimulation]].

==Applications==
Insights from several pure disciplines across behavioural sciences are explored by various applied disciplines and practiced in the context of everyday life and business. These applied disciplines of behavioural science include: [[organizational behavior]], [[operations research]], [[consumer behaviour]] and [[media psychology]].

== Differentiation from social sciences ==
The term ''behavioural sciences'' is often confused with the term ''[[social sciences]]''.{{Who|date=September 2018}}  Though these two broad areas are interrelated and study systematic processes of behaviour, they differ on their level of scientific analysis of various dimensions of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science%3E|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural sciences abstract empirical data to investigate the decision processes and communication strategies within and between organisms in a social system. This involves fields like psychology, [[social neuroscience]] ethology, and cognitive science. In contrast, social sciences provide a perceptive framework to study the processes of a social system through impacts of social organization on structural adjustment of the individual and of groups. They typically include fields like [[sociology]], [[economics]],  [[public health]], [[anthropology]], [[demography]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Klemke" /&gt;

Many subfields of these disciplines cross the boundaries between behavioral and social sciences. For example, [[political psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]] use behavioural approaches, despite the predominant focus on systemic and institutional factors in the broader fields of political science and economics.

The '''Centro de Relaciones Internacionales''' ('''CRI''', ''International Relations Center'') is an educational and [[research institute]] belonging to [[Mexico]]'s [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM). Founded in 1970, the CRI is attached to UNAM's [[Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales]] (FCPyS, ''Faculty of Political and Social Sciences'') and offers academic degrees in [[international relations]] studies and theory.

==History==
UNAM was the first academic institution in [[Mexico]] to implement study and research programs in the field of international relations studies. Its first university program in the area was created in 1952, called "Diplomatic Sciences Degree". This degree was created to offer  [[multidisciplinary]] studies combining elements from [[History]], [[Law]] and [[Politics]].

In 1968, a reform transformed the degree program to a dedicated "International Relations Degree". In 1970, the CRI was formed as a distinct research and teaching center under the auspices and administration of the political and social sciences faculty (FCPyS) to coordinate UNAM's programs and research in international relations topics.

==Programs==
Currently the CRI divides its teaching and research programs into six areas:

*[[International relations theory|Theory and Methodology of International relations]]
*[[International politics]]
*[[International law]]
*[[International political economy|International economy]]
*[[Foreign relations of Mexico|Mexican Foreign Policy]]
*[[Area studies|Regional Studies]]

{{Main|Asherah pole}}
An Asherah pole is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Asherah|Ugaritic mother-goddess Asherah]], [[Spouse|consort]] of [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; the book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains but his conclusions were not well received in the scholarly press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''asherim'' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and thus objects of contention among competing cults. The insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.&lt;ref&gt;John Day, "Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''105'''.3 (September 1986:385-408) p 401; ''asherim'' are discussed pp 401-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of King Josiah, it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp&lt;/ref&gt; such theories inspire ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known as the friend of [[Indra]]. During his reign, Chedi kingdom  introduced ''Shakrotsava'' festival in his kingdom in the honor of Indra. The festival involved planting of a bamboo pole every year, in honor of Indra. The king will then pray for the expansion of his cities and kingdom. After erecting the pole, people decked it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. (1,63).

{{Main|Maypole|Mære Church}}
[[File:Maypole Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing around the maypole, in [[Åmmeberg]], Sweden]]
A [[maypole]] is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on [[May Day]] or [[Pentecost]] ([[Whitsun]]), although in some countries it is instead erected at [[Midsummer]]. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the [[Germanic paganism]]&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russel|first1=Jefferry Burton|title=Medieval Civilisation|orig-year=1968 |date=22 February 2005 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |location=Eugene|isbn=1-59752-103-5|page=243|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=C05LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Iron Age]] and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the [[Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.&lt;ref name="Kelly Cannon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cannon|first1=Kelly|title=Good Neighbor: Former teacher continues tradition of Maypole dance|url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/good-neighbor-former-teacher-continues-tradition-of-maypole-dance/article_43e9b2fb-2f30-54b6-aeb3-34398c645005.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=From the Good Neighbors series|agency=The Herald Journal's Staff writer|issue=May 21, 2015|publisher=The Herald Journal, 75 West 300 North Logan, UT|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, [[Germanic paganism]] was followed in various forms, has led to speculation that the maypoles were in some way a continuation of a Germanic pagan tradition.&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton" /&gt; One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including [[Thor's Oak]] and the [[Irminsul]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Pagan Europe'' by Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-15804-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-15804-6}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Frazer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|date=1922|page=Chapter 10:: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that, in [[Norse paganism]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] views held that the universe was a [[world tree]], known as [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;'The London quarterly review, Volumes 113-114', Theodore Foster, 1863, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The History of Religions' By Hopkins Edward Washburn, The McMillan Company 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''European paganism: the realities of cult from antiquity to the Middle Ages'' by [[Ken Dowden]], Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-12034-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12034-0}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Nart sagas from the Caucasus: myths and legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs' by [[John Colarusso]], Princeton University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-691-02647-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02647-3}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The early history and antiquities of Freemasonry: as connected with ancient Norse guilds, and the oriental and mediæval building fraternities' by George Franklin Fort, Bradley, 1881, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor of the [[Mære Church]], [[Norway]], was excavated in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Lidén, Hans-Emil. 1969. From Pagan Sanctuary to Christian Church, the Excavation of Mære Church in Trøndelag. Norwegian Archaeological Review. (1969) 2, pp. 3–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and found to contain the remains of a pagan cult structure. The nature of that structure was not clear. Lidén felt this represented the remains of a building, but a critique by Olsen (1969:26) in the same work suggested this may have been a site for pole-related rituals. A recent review of the evidence by Walaker (Norddide 2011: 107-113)&lt;ref&gt;Walaker Nordeide, Sæbjorg. 2011. The Viking Age As a Period of Religious Transformation: The Christianization of Norway from AD 560 to 1150/1200. {{ISBN|2503534805}}, Brepols Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that this site was similar to the site in Hove (Åsen, also in Nord-Trøndelag) and was therefore likely the site of a ceremonial pole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1491">The '''''{{lang|fr|Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure}}''''' ('''CEVNI'''; European Code for Navigation on Inland Waterways) is the European code for rivers, canals and lakes in most of Europe.

Not all European countries use CEVNI for their inland waterways. The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Nordic countries]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]] except [[Croatia]] have their own regulations.

CEVNI contains the core uniform rules applicable to the traffic on inland waterways, such as visual signs on vessels, sound signals and radiotelephony, waterway signs and markings, rules of the road, berthing rules, and prevention of pollution of water and disposal of waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10862">'''Consulting psychology''' is a specialty area of [[psychology]] that addresses such areas as [[psychological evaluation|assessment]] and interventions at the individual, group, and organizational levels. The ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, R.L. (Ed.). (2002). ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; provides an overview of specific areas of study and application within the field. The major journal in the field is ''[[Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research]]''. Consulting psychologists typically work in business or non-profit organizations, in consulting firms or in private practice. Consulting psychologists are typically professionally licensed as psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apadiv31.org/Coop/EducationInOrganizationalPsychology.pdf |title=Education and Training in Organizational and Consulting Psychology |last=Lowman |first=Rodney L. |work=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining consulting psychology==
The [[American Psychological Association]] defines the fields as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Consulting psychology shall be defined as the function of applying and extending the specialized knowledge of a psychologist through the process of consultation to problems involving human behavior in various areas. A consulting psychologist shall be defined as a psychologist who provides specialized technical assistance to individuals or organizations in regard to the psychological aspects of their work. Such assistance is advisory in nature and the consultant has no direct responsibility for its acceptance. Consulting psychologists may have as clients individuals, institutions, agencies, corporations or other kinds of organization."&lt;ref&gt;APA Division 13, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consultation should help individuals and organizations "become more efficient and effective."&lt;ref&gt;Former Div. 13 Chair DeWayne Kurpius, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic model encompasses all kinds of consulting, starting with Entry, moving through Diagnosis and Implementation and ending with an explicit Disengagement.&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Caplan, G. (1970). ''Theory and practice of mental health consultation''. New York: Basic Books.; Caplan, G. &amp; Caplan, R.B. (1993). Mental health consultation and collaboration. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Client-centered===

This approach focuses on an individual client (recipient of service) and helps service providers better help that client.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant functions assesses the client, makes a diagnosis and recommends changes to the consultee, typically a teacher, physician or other care providers.

===Consultee-centered===

This relationship focuses on the consultee rather than a particular client, helping build new skills via training and/or supervision.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant typically does not meet clients directly. Consultees seek consultation to increase knowledge, skills, confidence, and/or objectivity.

===Consultee-centered administrative consultation===

In some cases, the focus is on administrative rather than professional staff. Such relationships are typically longer term.

=== Behavioral consultation model/behavioral-operant ===
In this model, the consultant is an authority figure who assumes primary responsibility for the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan, J.R. &amp; Kratochwill, T.R. (1990) ''Behavioral Consultation and Therapy''. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on problem-solving more than skills development or a particular client.

===Organization consultation===
This model employs systems theory to improve productivity or to streamline the relationship between an organization and its environment.

===Statistical consultation===
A model that focuses on having statistical consultants to research empirical evidence and sophisticated analysis through consulting test and certified projects.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J. &amp; Dang, J.(2010) ''Measurement, Monte Carlo, and music: Why doctorates in psychology and other applied fields make desirable consultants in statistics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation and risk management===
A model used by behavioral scientists who works in jury thought and decision making processes. They are usually reserved to help attorneys and insurance companies to evaluate the risks of lawsuits and/or the application of settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, J. M. (2010) ''Litigation consulting: Expanding beyond jury selection to trial strategy and tactics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,
12–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
Consulting psychology encompasses diverse roles including individual assessment, individual and group process consultation, organizational development, education/training, employee selection/appraisal, research and evaluation test construction, executive/manager coaching, change management, expert technical support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div13.org/about_consulting.aspx |title=Society of Consulting Psychology (Division 13) |publisher=Div13.org |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional education==
The [[American Psychological Association]] publishes professional training guidelines for consulting psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines for education and training at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels in consulting psychology/Organizational consulting psychology (2007). ''American Psychologist'', 62, 980–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Master's programs are available under varying program names (e.g., business psychology). Some psychologists come to the field from areas such as [[clinical psychology]], [[counseling psychology]], or [[industrial and organizational psychology]].

==Consultation in community psychology==
It is often critical to build community relationships to understand the context and enable the collection of appropriate data to supporting the consulting relationship. Strong relationships can increase trust between consultants and clients, leading to more effective interventions. [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]'s model of [[Ecological Systems Theory]] is a framework for navigating the challenges of consulting in community psychology.

===Cultural sensitivity===

{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Consulting psychology can involve providers in communities unlike their own. Success requires sensitivity to cultural variation, including recognition of the consultant's own cultural bias and/or ethnocentrism. This is further complicated by potential differences between the background of the consultee and client. In this context, "culture" involves client’s/consultee’s religious, cultural and family background and value system.

Cultural differences can involve communication styles, attitudes towards conflict, approaches to completing tasks, decision-making and attitudes towards disclosure.

==Notable consulting psychologists==
Consulting psychologists who have helped to develop the field include [[Clayton Alderfer]], Chris Argyris, [[Eliott Jaques]], Harry Levinson, and [[Edgar Schein]]. More recent authors include Arthur Freedman, Dale Fuqua, Richard Kilburg, [[Rodney L. Lowman]], Jody Newman, Ann O'Roark, David Peterson, Sharon Robinson-Kurpius, Peter Sorensen, and Len Sperry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Society of Consulting Psychology==
The field's professional association is the [[Society of Consulting Psychology]], Division 13 of the [[American Psychological Association]]. The [[Society of Industrial–Organizational Psychology]] is another professional association of which many consulting psychologists are members.

The [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] certifies participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3314 |title=ABAP – Organizational and Business Consulting Psychology |publisher=abpp.org |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues==
Consultants face different ethical questions than clinicians:&lt;ref&gt;Fanibanda, D.K. (1976). Ethical issues of mental health consultation. ''Professional Psychology'', 7, 547–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What degree of responsibility does the consultant take for a consultee's behavior and client outcomes?
* To what extent and over what period is the consultee dependent on the consultant?
* How is the consultant's responsibility for resolving conflicts with and among other participants?
* What are acceptable motivations for the consultant to offer consulting services?
* How are financial arrangements handled?
* What is the proper oversight for consulting relationships?
* What are the consultant's responsibilities for maintaining confidentiality?

Consulting relationships differ from traditional counseling and psychotherapeutic relationships in fundamental ways{{vague|date=July 2012}} that require consideration in evaluating ethical questions. As of 2012, formal ethical guidelines specific to the discipline are not available. Existing codes of ethics for the helping professions provide limited guidance for consultation practice.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;Newman, J.L. (1993). Ethical Issues in Consultation. ''Journal of Couunseling and Development'', 72, 148–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical issues are inevitably complicated by the fact that consulting relationships involve three parties: the consultant, the consultee, and the consultee's client system.

Confidentiality depends on the consultant and on the cooperative efforts of perhaps many organizational members. Variable levels of participation means attention to providing only appropriate access to information. Managing information access and confidentiality require negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J.L. &amp; Robinson, S.E. (1991). In the best interests of the consultee: Ethical issues in consultation. ''Consulting Psychology Bulletin'', 43, 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clients' right to informed consent must be maintained in the presence of a consulting relationship. This right is complicated by the corresponding rights of consultees, including the right not to accept consultation.

Power is typically distributed unequally among participants in the consultation process. Power differentials may be real or perceived. Those with greater power must take responsibility for its use and impact.&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt;

Consultants with preexisting personal or professional relationships with participants in the consultation must take care that such relationships do not comprise the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163365">The [[writ]] of '''''coram nobis''''' (also known as ''writ of error coram nobis'', ''writ of coram vobis'', or ''writ of error coram vobis'') is a legal order allowing a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a [[fundamental error]] that did not appear in the records of the original judgment's proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Mixon'', 983 S.W.2d 661, 672 (Tenn. 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "coram nobis" is Latin for "before us" and the meaning of its full form, ''quae coram nobis resident'', is "which [things] remain in our presence".  The writ of coram nobis originated in the [[England and Wales|English]] court of [[common law]] in the [[English legal system]] during the [[16th century|sixteenth century]].

The writ of coram nobis still exists today in a few courts in the United States. In 1907, the writ became obsolete in England and replaced by other means of correcting errors; however, the writ survives in the United States in various forms in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], in sixteen [[State court (United States)|state courts]], and the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia courts]]. For those courts with the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis, the rules and guidelines differ – sometimes significantly.  Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  In other words, the criteria required to issue the writ in one state (or federal) court system are different from the criteria required to issue the writ in a different court system.  A writ can be granted only by the court where the original judgment was entered, so those seeking to correct a judgment must understand the criteria required for that specific court.

==History==

===England===
The ''writ of error coram nobis'' originated in England over 500 years ago. The name of the writ combines three terms: writ, writ of error, and coram nobis. '''Writ''' is an official written command. '''Writ of error''' provides a superior court the means to correct errors of a lower court. Writ of error '''''coram nobis''''' is a variation of the writ of error and provides a court the means to correct its own errors.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward N. [https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&amp;context=dlj ''The Writs of Error Coram Nobis and Coram Vobis''.] Duke Bar Journal 2.1 (1951): 29-39. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edward the Confessor sealed writ.jpg|thumb|A sealed writ of [[Edward the Confessor]], a king of England who died in 1066 – the same year as the Norman Conquest]]

==== Writ ====
Sometime before the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|tenth century]], officials in England began utilizing writs to convey orders.&lt;ref&gt;Harper-Bill, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FaI5tE6z07gC ''Anglo-Norman Studies, XXVII: Proceedings of the Battle Conference, 1994.''] Boydell Press (1995). 114-116.&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[writ]]" was simply a short written command issued by a person in authority. It was customary for the sender to [[Great Seal of the Realm|seal]] this written command as proof of its authenticity. In the days when writing was a rare art, a writ was revered because the person receiving the command was unlikely to deny or question its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, Edward. [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2956&amp;context=ylj ''The Prerogative Writs in English Law''.] The Yale Law Journal 32.6 (1923): 523-534.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066 led to the establishment of a strong, centralized monarchy. The first [[Normans|Norman]] [[King of England]], [[William the Conqueror]], modified writs to become mainly framed in Latin, increased the number of writs to cover additional royal commands, and established the ''[[Curia Regis]] '' in England.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curia Regis'', a Latin term meaning "royal council", consisted of the King of England and his loyal advisors. The ''Curia Regis'' accompanied the King as he travelled. This council administered all of the King's governmental activities, including judicial matters.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law.]'' Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important members of the ''Curia Regis'' was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. The Lord Chancellor led the chancery. [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] is a general term for a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] writing office that was responsible for the production of official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Corèdon, Christopher, and Ann Williams. [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Dictionary_of_Medieval_Terms_and_Phras.html?id=RxJlQgAACAAJ ''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'']. Cambridge, England: D.S. Brewer, 2004. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor wrote writs on behalf of the King, maintained all official documents, and acted as the keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal seal]]. This position, in effect, placed the Lord Chancellor as the head of the English legal system. The King, however, was the ultimate leader of the kingdom; therefore, the Lord Chancellor issued writs under the guidance of what he believed to be the best interests of the King.  Between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Lord Chancellor had a large control over issuance of all original writs. An original writ began a legal proceeding, while a judicial writ was issued during a legal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error ====
One such "original" writ was the writ of error. In medieval England, the word "[[appeal]]" was not the term used to describe a request to review the legality of a lower court's decision. Instead, a "petition of error" requested higher courts to review the legality of an order or sentence.  Petitioners brought a petition of error before the Lord Chancellor. Due to his position and close relationship with the law, the Lord Chancellor could naturally determine if the petition provided sufficient evidence of an error and, if so, the type of writ most appropriate to correct the error. If a lower court committed an error of law, the Lord Chancellor would issue a writ of error. A writ of error required the lower court to deliver the "records"&lt;ref&gt;The record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict. The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury. See Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; of the case to a [[superior court]] where the court reviewed the case for legal errors. Because a writ of error was only available for a higher court to determine if a lower court committed an [[Question of law|error of law]], courts needed another type of writ to correct its own decision upon an [[Question of law|error of fact]]. To rectify this issue, the Lord Chancellor created a new writ - the writ of error coram nobis. Thus, the original writ of coram nobis provided the means to correct errors that the writ of error could not correct. Unlike the writ of error, the writ of coram nobis:
#corrected only factual errors that were not raised in the original case proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7239470899724667152&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bronson v. Schulten''], 104 U.S. 410, 416 (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;
#allowed the same court that presided over the original case to correct its own error, and
#required the original case records to remain with the court that presided over the original case.&lt;ref&gt;Archbold, John Frederick.[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yJVKAQAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=234#v=onepage&amp;q=coram%20nobis&amp;f=false ''The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions, and Ejectment'']. No. 57603-57612. EB Gould, 1827 p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error coram nobis ====
“Coram nobis” is Latin for “before us”. Initially, when the Lord Chancellor issued orders on behalf of the King and the royal court, the word “us” simply referred to the King, the Lord Chancellor, and other judges of this court. The royal court originated within the ''Curia Regis'', which began during the [[England in the High Middle Ages|twelfth and thirteenth centuries]], under the realm of [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] (Henry II). Henry II made writs available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion of writs within the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand of judicial maters before the ''Curia Regis'' in the twelfth century led to the establishment of two central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. These courts became the superior courts to all other courts in England, including local and tribunal courts such as the [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred Courts]] and [[Court of Piepowders]].

*'''The Court of King's Bench''' heard all complaints and pleas addressed to the King. This court was also known as the Court of Queen's Bench during the reign of a female monarch. Members of this court included the King and his closest advisors. This court always travelled with the King as he travelled throughout England and into other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Frederick Bernays. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/abaj59&amp;div=161&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Tracing the Origins of the Court of King's Bench''] ABAJ 59 (1973): 753-754.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of King's Bench, the original full name of the writ was '''''quae coram nobis resident''''' or "Let the record remain before us". The words "let the record remain" indicate the court record of the original case remained with the court of King's Bench, unlike a writ of error, where the record moved to a different court. The words "coram nobis" ("before us") referred to the role of the King who served on the King's Bench. The King's place on the court of King's Bench became increasingly irregular; and by 1421, the King's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King. Although the King's presence was theoretical, the Lord Chancellor and his office continued to issue writs as if the King continued to as part of this court.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''An Introduction to English Legal History''. (2002). Butterworths LexisNexis. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Court of Common Pleas''' was authorized by [[Magna Carta]] to sit in a central, fixed location.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Common Pleas, Court of|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; This court heard complaints and pleas that did not require the King's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. (1977). [https://jstor.org/stable/844792 ''The Origins of Common Pleas and King's Bench'']. The American Journal of Legal History, 21(3), 245.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of Common Pleas, the original full name was '''''quae coram vobis resident''''', or "Let the record remain before you". These words indicate that the records of the original case remained with the judges of the Court of Common Pleas so that it may review a case it previously decided to determine if an error of fact occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, Morgan. [https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&amp;context=lawreview ''The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in California'']. (1990). Santa Clara L. Rev. 30: 1-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the authority to issue writs shifted from the Lord Chancellor to the courts.  Although the King was no longer part of the court issuing the writ, the name "coram nobis" continued because courts associated the name with its function rather than its original Latin meaning. Thus, in English law, the definition of "coram nobis" evolved and is now redefined as a remedy for a court to correct its own error.&lt;ref&gt;Piar, Daniel F. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nkenlr30&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Using Corum Nobis to Attack Wrongful Convictions: A New Look at an Ancient Writ'']. N. Ky. L. Rev. 30 (2003): p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abolition in English courts====
The first case involving the writ of coram nobis is unknown due to incomplete historical records prior to the sixteenth century; however, the first recorded case involving the writ of coram nobis occurred in 1561 in the case of ''Sir Gilbert Debenham and Another v. Bateman''.&lt;ref&gt;2 Dyer 195(b), See also Green, W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0QwAAAAIAAJ The English Reports. ''Debenham v. Bateman''] v4; v. 73. (1907) p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1705, the writ of error was originally a matter entirely up to the discretion of either the monarch or those with the authority to make decisions on behalf of the monarch; but in 1705, the court held that the writ was a matter of right instead of a matter of discretion.  Despite making writs of error a matter of right, courts rarely used these writs because of their cumbersome and impractical procedure.  A writ of error moved the record from the original court to a higher court; however, the record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict.  The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, England abolished all writs of error, including the writs of coram nobis and coram vobis, and replaced them with appellate procedures encompassing all rights previously available through these writs.  Thus, the abolition of the writ of coram nobis in England was due mostly to administration difficulties with the writ of error, and not because of administration difficulties with the writ of coram nobis itself.  The law abolishing the writ in civil cases was the Common Law Procedure Act 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, 15 &amp; 16 Vict., ch. 76, s. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws abolishing the writ in criminal cases was the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Appeal Act 1907, 7 Edw., ch. 23, s. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
After arriving in North America in the [[17th century|seventeenth century]], [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlers]] established [[Thirteen Colonies|English colonies]]. Within these colonies, the settlers created colonial courts that adhered to the [[English Law|English legal system]] and issued writs in the same manner as English courts. After the United States obtained [[American Revolution|independence from England]], state governments, as well as the federal government, [[Reception statute|provided courts the authority to continue to rely]] upon writs as a source of law unless issuing the writ violated the state or federal constitution or if either the state or federal government subsequently enacted a statute restricting the writ.&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, E. (1986).[https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1667&amp;context=faculty_scholarship ''Thinking About Habeas Corpus'']. Case W. Res. L. Rev., 37, 748, 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of allowing courts to issue writs was to fill a void whenever the state constitution, state statutes, the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes did not address an issue to be decided before the court.  Writs were especially important when the federal government, as well as each state, first established its judicial system.  During those times, there were very few (if any) statutes or case laws for courts to rely upon as guidance. In those circumstances, the English writs provided fledgling federal and state courts an important source of law.
Over time, writs became significantly less important as Congress and state legislatures enacted more statutes and further defined rules for its judiciary.  Writs also evolved independently in the federal judicial system and each state's judicial system so that a writ within one judicial systems may have a vastly different purpose and procedures from the same writ in other judicial systems.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, Donald E., ''Federal and State Postconviction Remedies and Relief''. Harrison Company, 2001. p. 55-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Different characteristics of a writ from one judicial system to another is the result of the [[Federalism|federal]] system of government prescribed within the United States Constitution.  [[Federalism in the United States]] is a mixed system of government that combines a [[Federal government of the United States|national federal government]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]].  While federal courts are superior to state courts in federal matters, the Constitution limits the reach of federal courts; thereby, providing state courts general sovereignty and law-making authority over a wider range of topics. This sovereignty allows each judicial system to decide whether to adopt writs and the function and purpose of each writ it adopts. Thus, the use and application of writs, including the writ of coram nobis, can vary within each of these judicial systems.

Legislation authorizes a judicial system to issue the writ of coram under one of two conditions:
#Where legislation permits courts to issue writs, but the legislation does not specifically mention the writ of coram nobis. Courts throughout the United States generally have the authority to issue writs whenever the constitution or statutes encompassing a court's jurisdiction do not address an issue before the court and issuance of the writ is necessary to achieve justice.  This authority was especially important for earlier courts when there were few statutes or case law to rely upon.  Over time, legislatures enacted statutes encompassing almost all issues that could arise before a court.  As a result, courts today rarely need to rely on writs as a source of law to address an issue not covered by statute. One example of a rare issue where courts have the occasion to issue the writ of coram nobis is the issue of former federal prisoners who have new information and this new information would have resulted in a different verdict if the information were available at the time of trial. Whenever this specific issue comes before a federal court, there is no federal statute that specifically guides or regulates how the court must proceed; however, federal courts have determined that the writ of coram nobis is the proper vehicle to achieve justice under this specific issue.
#Where legislation specifically permits courts to issue, by name,  the writ of coram nobis. The use of writs in the United States is more common when legislation has authorized a writ by name and regulated its use by courts.  For earlier courts, the practice of issuing writs was an integral part of the judicial system's proceedings. Therefore, when legislatures enacted laws to regulate issues associated with writs, some legislatures adopted the exact name of the writ within its rules while other legislatures chose to abolish the names of the writ but provided an alternative remedy under a different name.  Tennessee is an example of a state where its legislature enacted a statute expressly authorizing courts to issue, by name, the “Writ of Error Coram Nobis” and regulated how this writ should be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/ Tenn.Code Ann. § 27-7 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other states replaced the writ of coram nobis with other post-conviction remedies. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a law on January 25, 1966 that expressly abolished the name “writ of coram nobis” and encated the state's Post Conviction Relief Act, which is now the sole means for obtaining post-conviction relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4875028688006369069&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Commonwealth v. Descardes'', 136 A.3d 493, 497-502 (Pa. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coram nobis in United States federal courts==
[[File: Coram nobis Timeline in US federal courts.png |thumb|500px|right|Historical dates for the writ of coram nobis in federal courts and post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners.]]
In 1789, Congress passed the Judiciary Act to establish the judicial courts in the United States. This Act also allows courts to issue writs, including the writ of coram nobis. Originally, federal courts applied the writ of coram nobis only to correct technical errors, such as those made by a clerk of the court in the records of the proceedings.  The 1914 Supreme Court case ''United States v. Mayer'', expanded the scope of the writ of coram nobis to include [[fundamental error]]s, but the Court declined in this case to decide whether federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506 ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 35, 69 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors, such as those where discovery of new information is sufficient to prove a convicted felon is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2220 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Morgan'' case, federal courts traditionally issue a writ of coram nobis whenever a former federal prisoner petitions the original sentencing court to set aside the conviction based upon new information that was not available when the petitioner was in-custody and where this new information demonstrates that the conviction was a result of a fundamental error.

===History of the writ of coram nobis in federal courts from 1789 to 1954===
====The Judiciary Act of 1789====
The history of the writ of coram nobis in United States federal courts began in 1789 when Congress enacted the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]]. Under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, federal courts have the authority to issue a [[writ]] whenever the court deems it necessary to achieve justice and whenever no congressional law covers the issues before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=204  1st Congress, 1st Session, 1 Stat. 81-82.]&lt;/ref&gt; This section was known as the “All-Writs Provision” of the Judiciary Act until 1948 when it became more commonly known as the “All-Writs Act” after Congress modified the Judicial Code and consolidated this provision into {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9932283031886059336 ''Pa. Bureau of Correction v. U.S. Marshals Service'', 474 U.S. 34, 40-41 (1985)] Since 1789, there have been only a few subtle amendments to the act, but none of the amendments have significantly changed the substance of the act from its original form.  In 1911, Congress adopted the [[Judicial Code of 1911|Judicial Code]] which organized all laws, or statutes, into the ''Code of Laws of the United States of America'' (commonly known as [[United States Code]] and abbreviated U.S.C.).  In 1948, Congress modified the code for the All Writs Act under 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) where it remains today.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the All Writs Act, federal district courts have the “power to issue writs of [[scire facias]], [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and all other writs not specifically provided for by [[statute]].” Congress had not specifically provided by statute the authority for federal courts to issue a writ of coram nobis; therefore, the All Writs Act provides federal courts this authority.&lt;ref&gt;The All-Writs Act only provides federal district courts the ''authority'' to issue writs; but, it does not provide federal district courts the ''jurisdiction'' to hear and issue writs. District courts have the jurisdiction to entertain writs, including a petition for the writ of coram nobis, under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|3231}} which confers on the district court original jurisdiction over "all offenses against the laws of the United States." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6762057459713035389&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Wilkozek'', 822 F. 3d 364, 368 (7th Cir. 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case in a federal court to address the writ of coram nobis was ''Strode v. The Stafford Justices'' in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;23 F. Cas. 236 (C.C.D. Va. 1810) (No. 13,537). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljhFAAAAYAAJ ''Reports of Cases Decided in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fourth Circuit: (1792-1883)'']. Volume 1. (1837) p. 162-165.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the opinion in this Circuit Court case and held that the writ of coram nobis is distinguishable from the writ of error and therefore not subject to the writ of error's statute of limitations. The first Supreme Court case mentioning the writ of coram nobis (using the term coram vobis) is the 1833 case, ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=134783638943220731&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood'', 32 U.S. 144, 147-148 (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court determined that the writ was available to correct its own errors, but the same remedy was also available using the preferred method of submitting a motion to the court.  Eighty years later, in 1914, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in ''United States v. Mayer''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 55, 67 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, while federal courts confirmed the writ of coram nobis was available to federal courts, this remedy was rarely necessary or appropriate in federal courts throughout the nineteenth century for the following two reasons:
#Courts generally considered the writ of coram nobis to be restricted to correct only technical errors, such as discovery of a defendant being under age, evidence that a defendant died before the verdict, or errors made by the court clerk in the recording of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', at  2220.]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Petitioners could raise a “motion to amend” to correct most of errors also corrected by the writ of coram nobis. Although courts recognized that the writ of coram nobis could also reverse the judgement on such defects, the preferred practice was to present the court with a motion to amend.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Plumer'', 3 Cliff. 28 (Circuit Court of Massachusetts, 1859) published by {{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl1GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA538&amp;lpg=PA538#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Federal Decisions: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court and District Courts of the United States, Volume 1|date=1884|page=541|last=Myer|first=William G.|publisher=The Gilbert Book Company |website=books.google.com |access-date= July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1946 amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure ====
In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enactment of these amendments, Congress reviewed all relief previously provided for civil cases through the writ of coram nobis and adopted those avenues of relief into the rules; therefore, eliminating the need for the writ in federal civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/archives/committee-reports/advisory-committee-rules-civil-procedure-june-1946|title= Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure - June 1946|date= June 1, 1946|website= uscourts.gov|access-date= July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the amendment, Congress expressly abolished the writ of coram nobis in Rule 60(b). Later, in 2007, Congress restructured the format of Rule 60, and moved the language expressly abolishing the writ of coram nobis in civil proceedings from Rule 60(b) to Rule 60(e) in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60] The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure proposed the amendments in June 1946. Congress passed the proposed amendments in December 1946, and the amendments became effective March 19, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of post-conviction remedies available to former federal prisoners from 1789 to 1954===
====Post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners prior to 1867====
In 1790, one year after Congress passed the Judiciary Act establishing federal courts, Congress enacted the [[Crimes Act of 1790|Crimes Act]] which created the first comprehensive list of federal offenses. From 1790 until 1867, there are few, if any, records of individuals challenging a federal criminal conviction after completion of the prison sentence.  Two primary reasons explains the absence of any challenges to a conviction by former federal prisoners:
#The Crimes List provided only twenty-three federal crimes.  Seven of these crimes, including treason and murder, were punishable by death. (In comparison, today there are approximately 3,600 to 4,500 federal statutes that impose criminal punishments.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds|first=Glenn Harlan|date=2015-03-29|title=When lawmakers don't even know how many laws exist, how can citizens be expected to follow them?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/crime-law-criminal-unfair-column/70630978/|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company |access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 500,000 former federal prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bonczar|first=Thomas P.|date=August 2003|title=Prevalence of Imprisonment in the U.S. Population, 1974-2001|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/prisontime.pdf|newspaper=CBS News|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|access-date=2018-07-21}} See also {{cite web |url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_releases.jsp|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Release Numbers|date=June 2018|website=bop.gov|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this large population, recent cases where a former federal prisoner is able to find new information sufficient to reverse the conviction is exceedingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the chances of this type of case arising prior to 1867, when the federal prisoner popular was significantly smaller, are even more remote.&lt;ref&gt;The government first reported a census of prisoners in 1880. In 1880, the federal prison population was 2,162. See {{cite web |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcsus5084.pdf|title=''Historical Corrections Statistics in the United States, 1850- 1984''|page=29|date=December 1986|website=bjs.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics|access-date=July 23, 2018}}. In comparison, the federal prison population in 2013 was 219,298. See {{cite web |url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp|title=''Past Inmate Population Totals''|website=bop.gov|publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons|access-date=July 23, 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#There were few [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral consequences]] stemming from a conviction at this time. Generally, the reason former convicted felons seek a writ of coram nobis is to eliminate collateral consequences ensuing the challenged conviction.  Collateral consequences are indirect consequences of a conviction.  While direct consequences of a conviction are usually issued by a judge in the [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|sentencing]] phase of a case (such as a prison sentence, probation, fines and restitution); indirect consequences of a conviction are not contained within a court sentence. Collateral consequences may include loss of voting privileges, loss of professional licenses, inability to qualify for some employment and housing opportunities, and damage to the person's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/dinovitzer/Publications/Hagan_Dinovitzer_1999.pdf Hagan, J., &amp; Dinovitzer, R. (1999). ''Collateral consequences of imprisonment for children, communities, and prisoners'', Crime and Justice 26 (1999): pp. 121-162.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867====
The [[American Civil War]] is historically significant upon the rights of former federal prisoners in two ways.  First, Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to prevent abuses following the civil war. This Act expanded the writ of habeas corpus to any person, including former prisoners. Second, states began imposing more collateral consequences upon those convicted of crimes; thus, providing more reasons why a person would want to have a wrongful conviction overturned. The loss of voting privileges was one of the most significant collateral consequence of a felony conviction. In 1800, no state prohibited convicted felons from voting; but by end of the U.S. Civil War, nearly eighty percent of state legislatures had passed laws barring felons the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=ustjlpp Clegg, R., Conway III, G. T., &amp; Lee, K. K. (2008). ''The case against felon voting.'' U. St. Thomas JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y, 2, 3 n.17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was legal in the United States until the 1860s.  In the 1860 [[United States presidential election, 1860|U.S. presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], supported the elimination of slavery. This controversial issue was the catalyst for the [[American Civil War]] that began in 1861 following the election of Lincoln and concluded in 1865. On March 3, 1865, President Lincoln signed a joint resolution declaring wives and children of persons in the armed forces to be free; and on December 18, 1865 the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] became effective. This Amendment abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]] in the United States. The purpose of the Habeas Act was to provide "what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wife and children of soldiers of the United States, and also to enforce the liberty of all persons."&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 4151 (1866). See also [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3451&amp;context=uclrev ''The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867: The Supreme Court as Legal Historian''], Mayers L., 33 U.Chi.L.Rev. 31 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 expanded the jurisdiction of the writ of habeas corpus to any person.  As a result, this act eliminated the writ of coram nobis in criminal cases because any person challenging a conviction, regardless of whether the person is in prison or not, could have raised the claim through the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;The writ of coram nobis has many similarities in origin and purpose with the [[writ]] of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]. ''Habeas corpus'' is a Latin phrase meaning "you have the body", where the English courts ordered officials to produce the body or deliver the prisoner to the court. See Robertson, J. (2008). [http://buffalolaw.org/past_issues/55_4/Web_Robertson%20Final%20Book%20Proof.pdf ''Quo Vadis, Habeas Corpus?''], Buffalo L. Rev., 1066.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Act of June 25, 1948====
In 1946, Congress abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases; and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 provided a remedy for jurisdictional and constitutional errors at the trial at any time, regardless of whether the person was in prison or had completed their sentence. For all practical purposes, the writ of coram nobis had no purpose in federal courts.  In fact, the Supreme Court commented on the writ of coram nobis in a 1947 case and determined "it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where this writ would be necessary or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Smith''], 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947). This statement was quoted by the Supreme Court in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Carlisle v. United States''], 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) regarding whether coram nobis petitions are ever appropriate from those who are in custody from the sentence begin challenged. In these cases, [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] are controlling.&lt;/ref&gt; But, on June 25, 1948, Congress passed legislation that would lead to the resurrection of the writ. The Act of June 25, 1948 combined two pieces of legislation:
#Congress passed the Act to organize all laws of the United States into a single source of reference, known as the [[United States Code]] (abbreviated U.S.C.). Any law (or statute) ever passed by Congress can be found in the United States Code.  The U.S.C. is divided into 50 titles. Within each title is a chapter, and within each chapter is a section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/safe_doses_act|title= How the US Code is Built.|website= law.cornell.edu|access-date= July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the titles created in the Act was Title 28 – Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Chapter 153 of this title is the chapter on Habeas Corpus. Section 2255 of this title is the section providing how prisoners can challenge a conviction. In legal documents, this section is commonly abbreviated 28 U.S.C. §2255.
#Congress passed the Act to solve a problem with habeas corpus petitions. The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 instructed prisoners to file a writ of habeas corpus with the district court whose territory included the prison.  For example, those imprisoned at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz Island]], California were required to file a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, even if the prisoner's conviction and sentence originated from a federal court in another district or state.  This rule led to administrative difficulties, especially for the district courts whose territorial jurisdiction included major federal prisons. The Act of June 25, 1948 codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and judicial habeas practice at 28 U.S.C. §2255 and changed the jurisdiction from the district of confinement to the district of sentence; however, the jurisdictional change was the only change Congress intended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952)], ("the sole purpose [of §2255 ] was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.")&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite legislative intentions for §2255 to only change the jurisdiction of the district courts, the language of the statute restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. Consequently, former prisoners had no statutory avenue to challenge a conviction.  As a result, this act indirectly resurrected the writ of coram nobis to former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Morgan'' (1954) provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners===
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1954, the United States Supreme Court held in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]
The Act of June 25, 1948 reworded the habeas corpus sections of the United States Code to provide only those individuals in-custody (as a result of a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; For those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in-custody, the question was whether the 1948 Act abolished all post-conviction review of a former prisoner's conviction.

In 1952 Robert Morgan, a former federal prisoner who had completed his sentence, petitioned to have his conviction overturned based on information he claimed to be unavailable at the time of his conviction. Although the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 would have allowed Morgan to challenge his conviction using the writ of habeas corpus, the Act of June 25, 1948 restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. The district court denied his petition because Morgan was no longer in custody for the conviction he sought to overturn. Morgan appealed that decision. In 1953, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and determined that the writ of coram nobis was available to Morgan.  The government appealed the appellate court's decision to the US Supreme Court.

The first question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether Congress intended to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners when it restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. If the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not intend to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners, then the second question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether the writ of coram nobis was available to challenge a conviction after completion of the petitioner's sentence. On January 4, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision. The Court first determined that Congress did not intend within the 1948 Act to eliminate all reviews of criminal convictions for petitioners who had completed their sentence.  Although the 1948 Act restricted former prisoners from challenging a conviction with a writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined by reviewing the legislative notes that Congress did not intend to abolish post-conviction challenges to a sentence from former prisoners.  Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], who authored the [[majority opinion]] for the Court, wrote;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he purpose of § 2255 was "to meet practical difficulties" in the administration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction. [] Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. We know of nothing in the legislative history that indicates a different conclusion. We do not think that the enactment of § 2255 is a bar to this motion, and we hold that the District Court has power to grant [the writ of coram nobis].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', at 510-511 (citations removed)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Congress did exclude former prisoners from challenging a conviction through the writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined that the All Writs Act provides federal courts the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis to former prisoners whenever new evidence proves the underlying conviction was a result of a fundamental error. Thus, ''Morgan'' officially revived the writ of coram nobis as the sole means for post-incarceration judicial review of federal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of rules and procedures governing coram nobis proceedings===
''United States v. Morgan'' provides broad, general guidance to courts on the rules and procedures in coram nobis proceedings, but since the ''Morgan'' case in 1954, the Supreme Court and Congress seldom provide lower courts additional guidance. Thus, Appellate courts generally fill in the gaps and provide guidance for rules and procedures unclarified by Congress and the Supreme Court; however, the interpretations of rules and procedures of coram nobis may differ in each appellate court. Thus, for a former federal prisoner who is attempting to decide whether to file a petition for the writ of coram nobis, it is necessary to understand the source of the rules and procedures.

The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One of the Constitution]] creates the legislature and provides Congress the means to create and enact laws.  [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three of the Constitution]] creates the judiciary and provides courts the means to interpret laws. Other than the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution has no language permitting or restricting courts from issuing specific writs, including the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Section 9 of Article One]] states that “the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congressional enactments====
The [[United States Congress]] enacts laws or [[Statutory law|statutes]], and codifies these statutes in the [[United States Code]].  In contrast to the writ of habeas corpus, Congress has seldom enacted statutes regulating the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;Congress authorized and regulated the writ of habeas corpus in four important acts:
*The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1867|Habeas Corpus Act of February 5, 1867]] expanded federal courts' habeas jurisdiction by extending federal habeas corpus relief to "any person," including state prisoners, detained "in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.
*The Act of June 25, 1948 where Congress established 28 U.S.C. sections 2241 to 2255 which restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners and changed the court where a habeas petition is directed from the district court where the prisoner was held to the district court where the prisoner was sentenced. See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952).]
*In the Act of Nov. 2, 1966, Congress amended habeas statutes to provide “a greater degree of finality of judgments in habeas corpus proceedings.” See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13596761522993185173&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''McCleskey v. Zant'', 499 U.S. 467 (1991).]
*The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] was incorporated to "curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus, and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay and abuse in [[Capital punishment|capital cases]]." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3514851794987003120&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Souter v. Jones'', 395 F. 3d 577, 599 (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes enacted by Congress regulating the writ of coram nobis are:
*In 1789, Congress enacted the Judicial Act.  The [[All Writs Act]] section of the Judiciary Act provides federal courts the authority to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” The All Writs Act gives courts the ability to decide which specific writs utilized in English courts are available and appropriate in U.S. federal courts. While Congress provides federal courts the authority to issue writs, it does not provide courts the authority to issue specific writs by name, such as writs of mandamus or writs of coram nobis. The code for the All Writs Act is {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.
*In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] to abolish the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enacting this statute, Congress reviewed all issues previously addressed by federal courts in writ of coram nobis proceedings, and incorporated remedies for those issues within the procedures. Rule 60(e) of this Procedure originated from this statute and states, “The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In  2002, Congress enacted Rule 4(a)(1)(C) of the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] to resolve a conflict among the federal appellate courts regarding the time limitations to file an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_4 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1)(C)].&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this amendment, the federal appellate courts were divided on whether coram nobis appeals have a 10-day time limit or a 60-day time limit.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)] The United States Court of Appeals for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts determined that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals.  Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 4(a)(1)(C) resolved the conflict and established a 60-day time limit to file the notice of appeal from a district court’s judgement in a coram nobis proceeding.

====United States Supreme Court decisions====
Following the Constitution and Congressional statutes, the next highest source for direction and guidance of rules and procedures is the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. Lower courts, such as federal appellate courts and federal district courts, must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction, meaning the Court chooses to hear cases for reasons it deems “compelling reasons” (such as resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or resolving an important matter of law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://litigation.findlaw.com/legal-system/how-does-the-u-s-supreme-court-decide-whether-to-hear-a-case.html |title= How Does the U.S. Supreme Court Decide Whether to Hear a Case?|website=litigation.findlaw.com|access-date= July 8, 2018}} See also [[Supreme Court of the United States#Case Selection|U.S. Supreme Court Case Selection]]. See also [[certiorari#United States law|certiorari]].&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot override any law enacted by Congress unless the law violates the Constitution. Federal courts also cannot repeal a statute unless Congress clearly intended to repeal the statute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5251920236993815863 ''Branch v. Smith'', 538 U.S. 254, 273 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, ''United States v. Morgan'' provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners.  The Court determined coram nobis relief “should be allowed . . . only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the circumstances must include all three of these conditions:
*to remedy errors ‘of the most fundamental character’
*when “no other remedy [is] then available”
*“sound reasons [exist] for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1286.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1954, the Supreme Court granted review of only one other coram nobis case.  In 2009, the Court clarified that [[Federal tribunals in the United States|Article I military courts]] have jurisdiction to entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2224 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than providing military courts the authority to issue the writ, the Supreme Court has declined to provide federal courts additional guidance in coram nobis proceedings. Appellate courts have occasionally criticized the Supreme Court for failing to provide this additional guidance.  The Seventh Circuit called the writ of coram nobis, “a phantom in the Supreme Court's cases”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2409262715757082555&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v.

Blanton'', 94 F. 3d 227, 232 (6th Cir. 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; The First Circuit wrote that its decision of time limitations “derives from the Morgan Court's cryptic characterization of coram nobis as a ‘step in the criminal case.’”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12743813748652182589&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trenkler v. United States'', 536 F. 3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, the First Circuit writes, “[t]he metes and bounds of the writ of coram nobis are poorly defined and the Supreme Court has not developed an easily readable roadmap for its issuance.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v.

====Federal courts of appeals decisions====
While the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States federal court system, the United States courts of appeals, or circuit courts, are the intermediate appellate courts.  There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals. Eleven courts of appeals are numbered First through Eleventh and have geographical boundaries of various sizes.  For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of all federal courts in only three states: Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of nine western states and two U.S. territories.  There is also a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Other tribunals also have "Court of Appeals" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals in court-martial cases.

Congressional statutes and Supreme Court decisions are controlling over courts of appeals.  Absent statutory rules or Supreme Court case law, a court of appeals decision establishes a binding precedent for the courts in its circuit; however, a court of appeals decision is not binding for courts in other circuits. Generally, when a court of appeals hears an issue raised for the first time in that court, it arrives at the same conclusion as other courts of appeals on identical issues raised before those courts.  However, whenever the courts of appeals arrive at different conclusions on the same issue, it creates a “circuit split”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&amp;context=articles|title=Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits and the Fourth Amendment|date=2012|page=1139|last=Logan|first=Wayne A.|publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review|website=ir.law.fsu.edu|access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each year, but only agrees to hear less than 100 of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16-2_Wachtell.pdf|title=An Empirical Analysis of Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures: The Call for Response and the Call for the Views of the Solicitor General|date=2008|page=241|last= Thompson|first=David C.|last2=Wachtell|first2=Melanie F.|publisher=George Mason Law Review|website=georgemasonlawreview.org |access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to accept a case is to resolve a circuit split. Currently, a circuit split exists in coram nobis cases involves the definition of “adverse consequences”  The Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must demonstrate that adverse consequences exist from the criminal conviction. Some courts of appeals determined adverse consequences occur with any collateral consequence of a conviction while other courts of appeals have limited “adverse consequences” to only a few collateral consequence of a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2880&amp;context=flr |title=Post-McNally Review of Invalid Convictions Through the Writ of Coram Nobis|date=1990|page=986|last=Duszak|first=M. Diane|publisher=Fordham Law Review|website=lawnet.fordham.edu|access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal district court decisions====
District courts must abide by congressional statutes, Supreme Court decisions, and decisions of the court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located. Whenever a district court hears an issue that is not specifically addressed by statute or by case law of a higher court, district courts often “develop the record”. In case of an appeal, the higher courts have the district court's reasoned decision as guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1309191511695911726 ''White v. White'', 886 F. 2d 721, 731 (4th Cir. 1989) (Murnaghan, C.J., dissenting)]&lt;/ref&gt; A developed record not only greatly facilitates the process of appellate review but also ensures that the district court has carefully considered the issues and applied the applicable law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1377706004517212105 ''Jones v. Morris'', 777 F. 2d 1277, 1281 (7th Cir. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for the writ===
====Rules for petitioners====
Writs of coram nobis are rare in U.S. federal courts due to the stringent criteria for issuance of the writ. ''Morgan'' established the following criteria required in a coram nobis [[petition]] in order for a federal court to issue the writ:&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis is a collateral attack on a [[Judgment (law)|judgement]] in a federal criminal case.''' A “collateral attack” is defined as an attack on a judgement in a proceeding other than a [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Appellate review|direct appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13423175293489651929&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Wall v. Kholi'', 131 S. Ct. 1278, 1284 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis in a federal court must seek to vacate a federal criminal conviction.''' A writ of coram nobis is not available in federal courts to challenge a conviction in a state court. The federal government operates its own coram nobis procedures independent from state courts. Those seeking to attack a state judgment must follow the post-conviction remedies offered by that state. A writ of coram nobis is also not available for civil cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.''' A person who is on probation is considered "in custody".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4710853263548376302&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Brown'', 117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir. 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone filing a coram nobis petition while in custody will have their petition either denied for lack of jurisdiction or categorized as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 if the petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition).
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must be addressed to the sentencing court.''' To challenge a conviction, the petitioner must send a request for a writ of coram nobis to the court clerk of the district court where the petitioner's conviction originated. In other words, a petitioner must request for the writ in the sentencing court, rather than any convenient federal court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3493090275204032030&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Rawlins v. Kansas'', 714 F. 3d 1189 (10th Cir.2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide valid reasons for not attacking the conviction earlier.''' Petitioners need to show "reasonable diligence", where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels (such as a §&amp;nbsp;2255 petition while in custody). A delay may be considered reasonable when the applicable law was recently changed and made retroactive, when new evidence was discovered that the petitioner could not reasonably have located earlier, or when the petitioner was improperly advised by counsel not to pursue habeas relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14233123309617983670&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Riedl'', 496 F. 3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' A petition for a writ of coram nobis must raise new issues of law or fact that could not have been raised while the petitioner was in custody.''' In ''Morgan'', the Court announced the writ was available where no other remedy is available. However, petitioners occasionally misinterpret this statement as an opportunity to re-raise arguments from previous post-conviction petitions. Appellate courts have consistently determined that the writ of coram nobis cannot be used as a "second chance" to challenge a conviction using the same grounds raised in a previous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102942438273961168&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Keane'', 852 F. 2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion and it was denied while in custody must obtain authorization from the district court in order to file a coram nobis petition.''' Currently, this rule only applies to those in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In 2018, the Eighth Circuit became the first appellate court to decide whether a petition for writ of coram nobis is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") restrictions on successive relief as defined in § 2255(h)(1) and (2). The Eighth Circuit held that coram nobis petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion, while in custody and the motion was denied while the petitioner remained in custody, is restricted by AEDPA from filing a coram nobis petition without first obtaining authorization from the ''district court'' to file the coram nobis petition. This requirement is different from those in custody who are required to obtain authorization from the ''appellate court'' in order to file a successive § 2255 motion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=970640436455318595&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Baranski v. United States'', 880 F. 3d 951, 956 (8th Cir. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal appellate courts have yet to issue an opinion on this question.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide adverse consequences which exist from the conviction.''' A “circuit-split” exists on this requirement. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts administer a "civil disabilities test" which requires a coram nobis petitioner to prove that his conviction produced ongoing collateral consequences; however, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits have held that the petitioner need not show that he is suffering from an ongoing "civil disability" because "collateral consequences flow from any criminal conviction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]] circuit has granted coram nobis relief without mentioning this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7014365937918134888&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Blanton v. United States'', 94 F. 3d 227, 233 (6th Cir. 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy to correct errors of the most fundamental character.''' The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete [[miscarriage of justice]]. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6561912920734236978&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bereano v. United States'', 706 F. 3d 568, 576-577 (4th Cir. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the same errors that are deemed grounds for Section 2255 habeas relief also justify coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;Wolitz, D. (2009).

Rev., 1277 p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For those claiming actual innocence, a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurs where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of one who is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16402025009521187784&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Murray v. Carrier'', 477 U. S. 478, 495-496 (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Procedural rules in federal district courts====
*'''District court clerks should file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original case number''' In ''Morgan'', the Supreme Court provided that the writ of coram nobis is a step in the criminal case and not the beginning of a separate civil proceeding. As a result, district courts, such as those in the Ninth Circuit, file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original criminal case number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12030576678750000031&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Telink, Inc. v. United States'', 24 F.3d 42, 46 (9th Cir. 1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''District courts should construe incorrectly titled petitions with the appropriate title.''' Whenever a [[United States district court|federal district court]] receives an incorrectly labeled or incorrectly titled petition, the court should construe the petition correctly.  District courts should construe a coram nobis petition from a federal prisoner as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Similarly, district courts should construe a habeas corpus petition from a former federal prisoner as a petition for writ of coram nobis. Federal courts have determined that a person on probation is still a federal prisoner; therefore, petitioners in this category must file a petition for writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8072550880880865091&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Scruggs'', 691 F.3d 660, 662 n.1 (5th Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; A federal prisoner convicted of more than one federal crime may file a petition for writ of coram nobis to challenge any conviction where the sentence is complete; but the prisoner must file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge any conviction where the sentence is not complete.

====Procedural rules in federal appellate courts====
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders are subject to a 60-day filing period''' Until 2002, two provisions in ''Morgan'' divided the [[United States courts of appeals|federal appellate courts]] interpretation on the time limits to file an appeal from a [[United States district court|district court's]] decision on a coram nobis petition. First, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is a step in the criminal case". Second, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is of the same general character as the writ of ''habeas corpus''". This created a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding the time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders. In 2002, Congress added language to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that clarified an application for a writ of error coram nobis is subject to a 60-day filing period.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12743813748652182589&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Trenkler'', 536 F. 3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2008)]. Prior to the 2002 enactment of Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(C), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts have held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals. Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal. [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders do not require a certificate of appealability ''' In 1996, Congress enacted the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") which included language that limits the power of federal judges to grant motions for habeas relief, including motions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. AEDPA requires a [[Certificate of Appealability]] in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a habeas corpus petition. Unlike the writ of habeas corpus, a Certificate of Appealability is not required in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a coram nobis petition. Neither the [[All Writs Act|28 U.S.C. § 1651(a)]] statute making the writ of coram nobis available in federal courts in criminal matters nor any [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure]] requires a certificate of appealability before an appeal may be taken, nor does such a requirement appear in the case law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=404840111229367794&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Baptiste'', 223 F.3d 188, 189 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some prisoners have attempted to file coram nobis petitions if AEDPA prevents the petitioner from filing under § 2255. However, federal courts have consistently held that prisoners may not resort to the writ of coram nobis in order to bypass AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6470098108909325880&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Barreto-Barreto v. United States'', 551 F. 3d 95, 103 (1st Cir. 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The [[standard of review]] from a district court's denial of a coram nobis petition is similar to the standard of review from a district court's denial of a habeas corpus petition.''' Generally, the standard of review is that any district court's determinations on questions of law are reviewed [[Standard of review#De novo|de novo]], but that district court's determinations on questions of fact are reviewed for clear error (or clearly erroneous error).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15607438945352724251&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v.

==U.S. state courts==

Only sixteen state courts and District of Columbia courts recognize the availability of writs of coram nobis or coram vobis. Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. The writ of coram nobis is not available in a majority of states because those states have enacted uniform [[Post conviction|post-conviction]] acts that provide a streamlined, single remedy for obtaining relief from a judgment of conviction, and that remedy is available to petitioners who are no longer in custody.  States that have replaced writs of coram nobis with remedies within their post-conviction proceedings are also independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  These proceedings enacted by state legislatures may either be more or less stringent than the writs it replaced or the post-conviction proceedings of other states.

===Availability===
The following table provides  whether each state's courts are authorized to issue a writ of coram nobis (or a writ of coram vobis), or provides the state statute which replaced or abolished the writ .

===Alabama===
Alabama state courts strictly follow the common law definition of the writ of ''coram nobis'' where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]].  The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The writ has only been applied to juveniles.  The [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines for ''coram nobis'' petitions for state courts in Alabama (citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11531273481429194505&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''W.B.S. v. State'', (2017) ___ Ala. ___ No. CR-15-0956 (decided April 28, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Rule 32, Ala. R. Crim. P. is applicable only to a "Defendant convicted of a criminal offense". Under Alabama law, a juvenile is not convicted of a criminal offense so as to be able to take advantage of the provisions of Rule 32. The writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy known more for its denial than its approval. Even so, Alabama Courts allow the writ of error coram nobis to attack judgments in certain restricted instances.
When no rule or statute controls, "[t]he common law of England, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws and institutions of this state, shall, together with such institutions and laws, be the rule of decisions, and shall continue in force, except as from time to time it may be altered or repealed by the Legislature." § 1-3-1, Ala. Code 1975.
The writ of error coram nobis was one of the oldest remedies of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.
An evidentiary hearing must be held on a coram nobis petition which is meritorious on its face. An evidentiary hearing on a coram nobis petition are required upon meritorious allegations:
*that counsel was denied.
*that the State used perjured testimony.
*that petitioner was not advised of right to appeal or right to transcript.
*of an ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically, failing to present alibi witnesses and failing to subpoena witnesses.
*of the denial of effective assistance of counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8703479901951317264&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Ex parte Boatwright'', 471 So. 2d 1257 (Ala. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A writ of error coram nobis is also the proper procedural mechanism by which a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent may collaterally challenge that adjudication.}}

===Arkansas===
Arkansas state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis for only four types of claims: [[Insanity defense|insanity]] at the time of trial, a coerced guilty plea, material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or a third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal. The [[Arkansas Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Arkansas]] provides the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Arkansas (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson v. State'', 531 S.W.3d 393 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=An Arkansas trial court can entertain a petition for writ of error coram nobis after a judgment has been affirmed on appeal only after the Arkansas Supreme Court grants permission to recall the case's [[Mandate (criminal law)|mandate]]. A writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinarily rare remedy. Coram nobis proceedings are administered with a strong presumption that the judgment of conviction is valid.  The function of the writ is to secure relief from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact that would have prevented its rendition if it had been known to the trial court and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not brought forward before rendition of the judgment. The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error of fact extrinsic to the record. The court is not required to accept at face value the allegations of the petition.

Due diligence is required in making application for relief, and, in the absence of a valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will not suffice. The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6174293652468987304&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Larimore'', 341 Ark. 397, 17 S.W.3d 87 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the writ of coram nobis is that it is addressed to the very court that renders the judgment where injustice is alleged to have been done, rather than to an appellate or other court. The writ is allowed only under compelling circumstances to achieve justice and to address errors of the most fundamental nature.  A writ of coram nobis is available to address certain errors of the most fundamental nature that are found in one of four categories:
# Insanity at the time of trial, 
# A coerced guilty plea, 
# Material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or 
# A third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal.

To warrant coram nobis relief, the petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error extrinsic to the record that would have prevented rendition of the judgment had it been known and, through no fault of the petitioner, was not brought forward before rendition of judgment. Moreover, the fact that a petitioner merely alleges a ''Brady'' violation is not sufficient to provide a basis for coram nobis relief.  To establish a [[Brady disclosure|''Brady'']] violation, three elements are required: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; (3) prejudice must have ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson'' at 396]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===California===
California state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Supreme Court of California]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in California (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Kim'', (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1078, 1091-96]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a non-statutory, common law remedy whose origins trace back to an era in England in which appeals and new trial motions were unknown. Far from being of constitutional origin, the proceeding designated "coram nobis" was contrived by the courts at an early epoch in the growth of common law procedure to provide a corrective remedy because of the absence at that time of the right to move for a new trial and the right of appeal from the judgment. The grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of coram nobis are narrower than on habeas corpus.  The writ's purpose is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court.

The principal office of the writ of coram nobis was to enable the same court which had rendered the judgment to reconsider it in a case in which the record still remained before that court. The most comprehensive statement of the office and function of this writ which has come to our notice is the following: The office of the writ of coram nobis is to bring the attention of the court to, and obtain relief from, errors of fact, such as the death of either party pending the suit and before judgment therein; or infancy, where the party was not properly represented by guardian, or coverture, where the common-law disability still exists, or insanity, it seems, at the time of the trial; or a valid defense existing in the facts of the case, but which, without negligence on the part of the defendant, was not made, either through duress or fraud or excusable mistake; these facts not appearing on the face of the record, and being such as, if known in season, would have prevented the rendition and entry of the judgment questioned.

The writ of coram nobis does not lie to correct any error in the judgment of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.

With the advent of statutory new trial motions, the availability of direct appeal, and the expansion of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases. The statutory motion for new trial has, for most purposes, superseded the common law remedy; and, until recent years, coram nobis was virtually obsolete in California.

The seminal case setting forth the modern requirements for obtaining a writ of coram nobis is ''People v. Shipman''&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9828531622292540314&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Shipman'' (1965) 62 Cal.2d 226]&lt;/ref&gt; which stated the writ of coram nobis may be granted only when three requirements are met:
# The petitioner must show that some fact exists which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment.
# The petitioner must show that the newly discovered evidence does not go to the merits of issues tried; issues of fact, once adjudicated, even though incorrectly, cannot be reopened except on motion for new trial.  This second requirement applies even though the evidence in question is not discovered until after the time for moving for a new trial has elapsed or the motion has been denied.
# The petitioner must show that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ.
Several aspects of the test set forth in ''Shipman'' illustrate the narrowness of the remedy. Because the writ of coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed at the time of judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, the remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law.  Moreover, the allegedly new fact must have been unknown and must have been in existence at the time of the judgment.

For a newly discovered fact to qualify as the basis for the writ of coram nobis, courts look to the fact itself and not its legal effect. It has often been held that the motion or writ is not available where a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge of the facts pleaded guilty or admitted alleged prior convictions because of ignorance or mistake as to the legal effect of those facts.

Finally, the writ of coram nobis is unavailable when a litigant has some other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis is not available where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion for a new trial and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.

The writ was issued by state courts in California in these types of situations:
*Where the defendant was insane at the time of trial and this fact was unknown to court and counsel.
*Where defendant was an infant and appeared by attorney without the appointment of a guardian or guardian ad litem.
*Where the defendant was a feme covert and her husband was not joined.
*Where the defendant was a slave and was tried and sentenced as a free man.
*Where the defendant was dead at the time judgment was rendered.
*Where default was entered against a defendant who had not been served with summons and who had no notice of the proceeding.
*Where counsel inadvertently entered an unauthorized appearance in behalf of a defendant who had not been served with process.
*Where a plea of guilty was procured by extrinsic fraud.
*Where a plea of guilty was extorted through fear of mob violence.
*Where defendants and their counsel were induced by false representations to remain away from the trial under circumstances amounting to extrinsic fraud.

By contrast, the writ of coram nobis was found unavailable by state courts in California in the following situations:
*Where trial counsel improperly induced the defendant to plead guilty to render him eligible for diversion and the trial court eventually denied diversion.
*Where the defendant pleaded guilty to having a prior felony conviction when he was eligible to have the prior reduced to a misdemeanor.
*Where the defendant discovered new facts that would have bolstered the defense already presented at trial. The court concluded that although the new facts would have been material and possibly beneficial to the defendant at trial, they would not have precluded entry of the judgment.
*Where the defendant mistakenly believed his plea to second degree murder meant he would serve no more than 15 years in prison.
*Where the defendant claimed neither his attorney nor the court had advised him before he pleaded that his convictions would render him eligible for civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA).
*Where the defendant challenged the legality of his arrest, the identity of the informant, and the failure of the court to make findings on the prior convictions. Coram nobis denied on the ground that "all of these matters could have been raised on appeal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v.

===Connecticut===
Connecticut state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Connecticut Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Connecticut]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Connecticut (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Henderson'', 259 Conn. 1, 3, 787 A.2d 514 (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law remedy which is authorized only by the trial judge.  The same judge who presided over the trial of the defendant is the only judge with the authority to entertain a writ of coram nobis unless the judge who presided over the case was not available, such as retirement or reassignment. If the original presiding judge is not available, then a judge of the same court must entertain the writ.

The writ must be filed within three years of conviction. This limitation is jurisdictional, so trial courts must dismiss petitions filed after the three-year limitations for lack of jurisdiction. This limitations period for coram nobis petitions has been the law in Connecticut since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;''Jeffery v. Fitch'', 46 Conn. 601, 604 (1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

The facts must be unknown at the time of the trial without fault of the party seeking relief. The writ must present facts, not appearing in the record, which, if true, would show that such judgment was void or voidable.

A writ of coram nobis lies only in the unusual situation in which no adequate remedy is provided by law. Moreover, when habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not lie. Prisoners who are in custody may only attack their conviction or sentence through habeas corpus and they are not eligible to file writs of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Henderson'' at 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===District of Columbia===
District of Columbia courts were established in 1970.  The court's authority is derived from the United States Congress rather than from the inherent sovereignty of the states. District of Columbia courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for District of Columbia courts (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hamid'', 531 A.2d 628, 634 (D.C.1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis in the District of Columbia is similar to the US Federal Court's interpretation of the writ where the writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy that can be used to correct a legal or factual error.

The primary function of the writ of coram nobis at common law was to correct errors of fact on the part of the trial court, not attributable to the negligence of the defendant, when the errors alleged were of the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.  The writ of provides a petitioner the opportunity to correct errors of fact not apparent on the face of the record and unknown to the trial court. In reviewing a petition for such a writ, there is a presumption that the proceeding in question was without error, and the petitioner bears the burden of showing otherwise.

The writ of coram nobis is available under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a) (2006), and the petitioner must show:
# The trial court was unaware of the facts giving rise to the petition; 
# The omitted information is such that it would have prevented the sentence or judgment; 
# The petitioner is able to justify the failure to provide the information;
# The error is extrinsic to the record; and 
# The error is of the most fundamental character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hamid'' at 634]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Maryland===
Maryland state courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Maryland (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok v. State'', 361 Md. 52, 760 A.2d 647 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A convicted petitioner is entitled to relief through the common law writ of coram nobis if and only if:
# The petitioner challenges a conviction based on constitutional, jurisdictional, or fundamental grounds, whether factual or legal;
# The petitioner rebuts the presumption of regularity that attaches to the criminal case;
# The petitioner faces significant collateral consequences from the conviction;
# The issue as to the alleged error has not been waived or "finally litigated in a prior proceeding, [absent] intervening changes in the applicable law"; 
# The petitioner is not entitled to another statutory or common law remedy (for example, the petitioner cannot be incarcerated in a State prison or on parole or probation, as the petitioner likely could then petition for post-conviction relief).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok'' at 661-62 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the Maryland Code (2014 Supp.), § 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article ("CP § 8-401") clarified that the failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Smith'', 443 Md. 572, 576, 117 A.3d 1093, 1097 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A writ denied in a lower state court may be appealed. A writ of coram nobis remains a civil action in Maryland, independent of the underlying action from which it arose.  As a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of the general appeals statute, Code § 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.  An appeal under the general appeals statutes would lie from a final trial court judgment in a coram nobis proceeding.  Although the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in coram nobis cases brought by an incarcerated person "challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of imprisonment", neither the Post Conviction Procedure Act nor any other statute which has been called to our attention restricts the right of appeal for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an error of fact or an error of law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Smith'' at 1097]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nebraska===

The purpose of the writ of error coram nobis is to bring before the court rendering judgment matters of fact which, if known at the time the judgment was rendered, would have prevented its rendition. The writ reaches only matters of fact unknown to the applicant at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment. The writ is not available to correct errors of law.

The burden of proof in a proceeding to obtain a writ of coram nobis is upon the applicant claiming the error, and the alleged error of fact must be such as would have prevented a conviction. It is not enough to show that it might have caused a different result.

A writ of coram nobis reaches only matters of fact unknown to the applicant at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment.

===Nevada===
Nevada state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Supreme Court of Nevada]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Nevada (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7404177734099015049&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trujillo v. State'', 310 P.3d 594, 597 (Nev. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Nevada Revised Statute 1.030, recognizes the applicability of the common law, and the all-writs language in Article 6, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution. This statute provides that the common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or the Constitution and laws of Nevada, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of Nevada. The post-conviction remedy authorized by Nevada statute, NRS 34.724(2)(b), provides that the petitioner must be in actual custody or have suffered a criminal conviction and not completed the sentence imposed pursuant to the judgment of conviction. Therefore, this statute is not available for those who are no longer in custody. Therefore, the common-law writ of coram nobis is available for a person who is not in custody on the conviction being challenged.

The writ of coram nobis may be used to address errors of fact outside the record that affect the validity and regularity of the decision itself and would have precluded the judgment from being rendered. The writ is limited to errors involving facts that were not known to the court, were not withheld by the defendant, and would have prevented entry of the judgment. A factual error does not include claims of newly discovered evidence because these types of claims would not have precluded the judgment from being entered in the first place. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also involves legal error and is therefore not available.

Any error that was reasonably available to be raised while the petitioner was in custody is waived, and it is the petitioner's burden on the face of his petition to demonstrate that he could not have reasonably raised his claims during the time he was in custody.

In filing the petition in the trial court is a step in the criminal process; however, the writ of coram nobis should be treated as a civil writ for appeal purposes. The writ is a discretionary writ and so a lower court's ruling on a petition for the writ is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard in the appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7404177734099015049&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trujillo'' at 597]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Hampshire===
New Hampshire courts may issue a writ of coram nobis to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. It is currently undetermined whether the writ may be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New Hampshire (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''State v. Santamaria'', 169 N.H. 722, 157 A.3d 409 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is an ancient writ that developed in sixteenth century England. The writ addresses errors discovered when the petitioner is no longer in custody and therefore cannot avail himself of the writ of habeas corpus. Granting such an extraordinary writ is reserved for the rarest of cases.

Because the writ of coram nobis existed within the body of English common law prior to adoption of our constitution, it continues to exist as a matter of New Hampshire common law so long as it is not "repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in [our] constitution". N.H. CONST. pt. II, art. 90. The common law writ of coram nobis is available in New Hampshire courts, because it was in force at the time of the New Hampshire constitution and there is no conflict between the writ of coram nobis and the constitution. The standard of appellate review of the denial of coram nobis is the same as the standard of review for a habeas corpus petition.

Coram nobis is available to correct a constitutional violation. A requirement to bringing a petition for a writ of coram nobis is that sound reasons exist for failing to seek appropriate earlier relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''Santamaria'', at 411-412]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Hampshire courts rely upon habeas corpus procedures to guide its approach to coram nobis proceedings, given the similarities between these avenues for relief. Similarly to habeas petitions, a trial court may deny a petition for a writ of coram nobis without holding an evidentiary hearing if the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant is not entitled to coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3522506785478977461&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

===New York===
New York state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals of the State of New York]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New York (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v Syville'', 15 N.Y.3d 391, 400 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In New York courts, the writ of coram nobis is available but its application is considerably different than the writ's application in other courts. In 1971, most of the common-law, coram nobis types of relief were abrogated when the New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (CPL 440.10) was enacted to embrace the deprivation of constitutional rights outside the record; however, the specific category of "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" was not specified by the Legislature at the time of its enactment.

The U.S. Constitution provides that a criminal defendant must be provided a right to appeal an unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel.  Consistent with the demands of due process, a criminal defendant must be allowed to assert that a right to appeal was extinguished due solely to the unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal.

CPL 460.30 contains a significant restriction as it imposes a one-year limit for the filing of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal.  Consistent with the due process mandate, CPL 460.30 should not categorically bar an appellate court from considering that a defendant's application to pursue an untimely appeal whenever:
# An attorney has failed to comply with a timely request for the filing of a notice of appeal and 
# The defendant alleges that the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year period, the time limit imposed in CPL 460.30.

Whenever these two criteria are met, the proper procedure is a coram nobis application to the Appellate Division. After CPL 440.10 was enacted, common-law coram nobis proceeding brought in the proper appellate court became the only available and appropriate procedure and forum to review a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Syville'' at 400]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oregon===
In November 2018, the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] determined that the writ of coram nobis is available in rare cases where newly discovered evidence provides clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence.  The Oregon Court of Appeals provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Oregon (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v. Nooth'', 294 Or. App. 711 (2018)] Note: this is a recent case and is subject to review by the Oregon Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1= The process that now governs Oregon post-conviction relief claims, the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), was enacted in 1959. Before its enactment, Oregon had a complex and confusing array of post-conviction remedies, including writs of habeas corpus (as provided both in the Oregon Constitution and in statutes), writs of coram nobis, motions to correct the record, and motions to vacate the judgment. The PCHA was intended to provide a detailed, unitary procedure to persons seeking postconviction relief.

From the time that it was enacted, there were questions as to whether the PCHA addressed claims of factual mistake based on newly discovered evidence—and the extent to which the PCHA altered the remedies available under preexisting law to a convicted person seeking to establish innocence through evidence discovered after the person's criminal trial. Two lawyers who participated in drafting the bill that became the PCHA, Jack Collins and Carl Neil, authored a law review article shortly after the act was adopted. In it, they suggested that innocence claims predicated on newly discovered evidence of innocence were not covered by the act (unless the evidence had been withheld from the petitioner by the prosecutor in a manner that violated the Fourteenth Amendment.) Collins and Neil observed that one of the remedies abolished by the PCHA, coram nobis, "might have been available" in the case of newly discovered evidence establishing innocence. Coram nobis was a procedural tool to correct errors of fact in judicial proceedings, and it functioned as a delayed motion for a new trial. However, Collins and Neil noted that the PCHA forecloses this possibility by abolishing coram nobis in criminal cases. Collins and Neil suggested that the problem of newly discovered evidence should be the subject of additional legislation. More than a half century has passed, and the legislature has not enacted such additional legislation or amended the text of ORS 138.530. Thus, the statutory bases for relief under the PCHA remain essentially as they were in 1959—with no more clarity as to whether the PCHA provides a mechanism for advancing a claim of innocence based on newly discovered evidence.

To the extent the constitution may protect the right of a convicted person to collaterally challenge a conviction based on new evidence of actual innocence, that remedy likely would take the form of coram nobis, a remedy that, historically, demanded proof of an extraordinary circumstance of innocence based on newly discovered evidence. Thus, in Oregon state courts
*The writ of coram nobis, or "motion in the nature of coram nobis," is an elastic but extraordinary remedy to correct mistakes of fact that occurred at trial. 
*The writ of coram nobis or motion in the nature of coram nobis allows courts to avoid manifest injustice or fraud on the court.
*Coram nobis is available only if it appears from the petition that the facts tendered as a basis for a new trial would have prevented the judgment entered.
*The standard for any cognizable actual-innocence claim under Oregon law, whether based on underlying constitutional or common-law principles, would necessarily reflect the same hesitance toward reopening a criminal proceeding based on anything less than reliable and compelling evidence calling into question, as a factual matter, the convicted person's guilt.
*The principles governing claims of actual innocence in federal court, to the extent those principles foreshadow the parameters of a federal constitutional claim of actual innocence, likewise indicate that a federal claim would be governed by similar exacting standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v.

{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis has traditionally been used to present facts extrinsic to the record in circumstances where no other remedy was available. An elementary restriction to the writ is that it will not permit a new examination of questions previously determined. Nor may it be employed as an alternative for direct appeal or habeas corpus.

In South Dakota, the jurisdiction of a court to grant relief under coram nobis is of limited scope. Any proceeding which is challenged by the writ is presumed to be correct and the burden rests on its petitioner to show otherwise. Relief will be granted only when circumstances compel such action to achieve justice. With one significant exception, coram nobis deals only with errors of fact. The exception is that the writ can reach certain constitutionally significant errors like jurisdictional defects.

The writ permits review of new evidence only if it was discovered after entry of the judgment and could not have been discovered and produced during the period when a statutory remedy was available. Any factual errors which have been, could have been, or should have been reviewed with another available remedy cannot be examined in coram nobis. On the other hand, facts incapable of being brought out earlier due to fraud or coercion may form the basis for coram nobis relief.

Those seeking coram nobis relief must carefully study the procedural history of the case, because past events control over which issues may or may not be raised and trial records have to be examined in order to ascertain whether a claim is barred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18353172842810443075&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Gregory'' at 878]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tennessee===
Tennessee courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment had it been presented at the trial. The [[Tennessee Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Tennessee]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Tennessee (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7728047675978746326&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Nunley v. State'', ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tenn. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Tennessee, the writ of coram nobis was recognized at common law but was not available in criminal cases. In 1858, the Tennessee General Assembly codified the procedure for petitioning for a writ of error coram nobis. This early codification of the writ was very limited in scope and could not be used to challenge judgments in criminal cases. In 1955, Tennessee's General Assembly extended the writ of error coram nobis to apply specifically to criminal proceedings. However, the new statutory writ could not be used to collaterally challenge a conviction based on newly discovered evidence. Finally, in 1978, the legislature broadened the scope of the writ to permit it to be used to challenge a judgment in a criminal case based on newly discovered evidence. Though the writ of coram nobis in civil cases was superseded when Rule 60 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure became effective in 1971, the adoption of Rule 60 did not supersede the statute which extended the writ as an available remedy in criminal proceedings. Currently the Tennessee statute on the writ of coram nobis provides:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without fault in failing to present certain evidence at the proper time, a writ of coram nobis will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been presented at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/section-27-7-102/ TN Code § 27-7-102 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decision whether to grant or deny a petition for writ of coram nobis lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court. The writ of coram nobis is not available for attacking a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13756889861943887747&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Frazier v. State'', 495 SW 3d 246 (Tenn. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Before granting a writ of coram nobis, the trial court must be satisfied with the reliability of the newly discovered evidence and determine that the defendant is without fault in timely discovering such evidence. The trial court must then review the evidence presented at trial and at the coram nobis proceeding and determine whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the result of the proceedings might have been different. Coram nobis claims are not easily resolved on the face of the petition and often require a hearing; however, an evidentiary hearing is not statutorily required in every case. Coram nobis petitions with inadequate allegations are susceptible to summary dismissal on the face of the petition, without discovery or an evidentiary hearing.

The writ of error coram nobis cannot be used to advance claims under ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9550433126269674519 ''Brady v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 83 (1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''Brady'' claim is a claim that a defendant’s right to a fair trial was violated because the State withheld exculpatory evidence that it is constitutionally required to provide to defendants. ''Brady'' claims must instead be litigated through the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act.  Timeliness under the statute of limitations is also an essential element of a coram nobis claim.  Unless time is [[Tolling (law)|tolled]] by a court, a writ of error coram nobis must be filed within one year of the date of a defendant’s conviction.

Since a petition for writ of error coram nobis is untimely unless filed within one year of the time a judgment becomes final in the trial court, a timely petition for writ of error coram nobis will almost always be filed while the defendant’s [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Direct Appeal|direct appeal]] is pending.  Therefore, when a convicted defendant files a petition for writ of coram nobis in the trial court while the direct appeal is pending, he or she must simultaneously file a motion in the appellate court to stay the appeal as of right until conclusion of the coram nobis proceeding in the trial court. On the same day that a petition for writ of coram nobis is filed in the trial court, the petitioner should also file in the appellate court a motion requesting that the appellate proceedings be stayed pending the trial court's decision on the writ of coram nobis. A copy of the petition should be attached to the motion. Under most circumstances, the motion to stay should be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Mixon'', 983 S.W.2d 661, 672 (Tenn. 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the trial court denies a coram nobis petition and the petitioner appeals the trial court's decision, the appellate courts [[Standard of review|review]] such the decision for an abuse of discretion. An appellate court will find an abuse of discretion only when the trial court applied incorrect legal standards, reached an illogical conclusion, based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or employed reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party.}}

===Vermont===
Vermont state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Vermont Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Vermont]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Vermont (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10849612183104217504&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Sinclair'', 191 Vt. 489, 492, 49 A.3d 152, 154 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ was designed to fill this gap somewhat to correct errors of fact affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment. It was commonly used in civil cases, but seldom in criminal cases. Vermont decisions have long recognized the general availability of coram nobis. In 1830, the Vermont Supreme Court explained that a writ of coram nobis will lie for error in fact, but it does not lie for error in law. The function of the writ is to call to the attention of the trial court facts and circumstances outside the record which would have precluded the entry of judgment had such facts been known and established at the time of the conviction.

In 1971, the writ was explicitly abolished in civil cases following adoption of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. When the PCR statute was enacted, it provided a means for those "in custody under sentence" to vacate, set aside or correct an invalid sentence, but the statute does not mention the writ of coram nobis. Similarly, the criminal rules set out various forms of post-judgment relief do not address coram nobis explicitly. Because the Vermont PCR statute and the criminal rules are silent on the issue, the common law remedy of coram nobis is a viable means for challenging criminal convictions. It may be used when no other remedy is available, but may not be used to supplant relief through direct appeal, post-judgment motion or PCR petition.

The Vermont Supreme Court has provided that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must be brought in the court that rendered judgment; however, the court has not reached the question as to the scope of the writ of coram nobis in state courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10849612183104217504&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Sinclair'' at 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Virginia===
Virginia state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram vobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram vobis petitions for state courts in Virginia (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2076285305325782298&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Neighbors v. Commonwealth'', 274 Va. 503, 508, 650 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Virginia, state courts use the term "coram vobis" instead of "coram nobis", although both writs are identical in nature. Virginia state courts are the last remaining courts known to incorporate the five-hundred year-old term, "writ of coram vobis".

The term "coram vobis" is Latin for "before you".  The full name is quae coram vobis resident ("Let the record remain before you"). It was called coram vobis (before you — the king's justices) in Common Pleas, where the king was not supposed to reside. It was called coram nobis (before us) in King's Bench because the king was supposed to preside in person in that court. The difference related only to the form appropriate to each court and the distinction disappeared in the United States when the need for the distinction ended.

In 1776, Virginia incorporated all of English common law by an ordinance of the Virginia convention. With the incorporation of English common law, Virginia recognized two ways in which a litigant could approach a trial court to challenge a final judgment. This could be done by 1) motion or 2) writ of coram nobis. The first Virginia case to recognize that a motion could be used to achieve the result of the writ of coram nobis was the 1795 decision in ''Gordon v. Frazier''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Frazier'', 2 Va. 130 (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gordon'', the use of a motion to have a trial court revisit a final judgment was the general practice at that time, even though the writ of coram nobis was available for the same purpose. It appears that the reason litigants used a motion to challenge a judgment, instead of the writ, was because filing a motion was less expensive than instituting a new proceeding by filing a petition for a writ. The court in Gordon summarized this matter as follows:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|This case tho' depending upon a practice not common in this country is by no means a difficult one. I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon'' at 130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1957, the writ was substantially limited by the General Assembly through Code § 8.01-677, which provides that {{nowrap|"[f]or}} any clerical error or error in fact for which a judgment may be reversed or corrected on writ of error coram vobis, the same may be reversed or corrected on motion, after reasonable notice, by the court."  In other words, the Code restricted a writ of error coram vobis only to clerical errors and certain errors in fact.

The principal function of the writ in Virginia is to afford to the court in which an action was tried an opportunity to correct its own record with reference to a vital fact not known when the judgment was rendered, and which could not have been presented by a motion for a new trial, appeal or other existing statutory proceeding.  In order to qualify for a writ of coram vobis:
* The petitioner must attack his conviction for an error of fact not apparent on the record.
* The discovery of factual errors must not be attributable to the applicant's negligence.
* The facts, if known by the court at the time of trial, would have prevented rendition of the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2076285305325782298&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Neighbors v.

===West Virginia===
West Virginia state courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in West Virginia (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14674575394383273578&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Hutton'', 235 W.Va. 724, 776 S.E.2d 621 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is only granted as a remedy of last resort where an error is of the most fundamental character and there exists no other available remedy. The writ is narrowly limited to extraordinary cases presenting circumstances compelling its use to achieve justice.

In West Virginia, the common law writ of coram nobis was abolished in civil cases in 1960 pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. No provision equivalent to the relief mechanism of Rule 60(b) exists in the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure.

West Virginia courts are authorized to issue the writ in criminal proceeding using criteria similar to the criteria established by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. The criteria established a four-part test. A petitioner seeking this relief must show that:
# A more usual remedy is not available. In other words, a petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.  
# Valid reasons exist for not attacking the conviction earlier. Petitioners need to show reasonable diligence, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels.
# Adverse consequences exist from the conviction; however, West Virginia courts have not yet established what constitutes "adverse consequences"'
# The error is of the most fundamental character. The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14674575394383273578&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hutton'' at 639]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wisconsin===
Wisconsin state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Wisconsin (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen v. State'', 95 Wis. 2d 207, 212, 213-14, 290 N.W.2d 685, 687, 688 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a common law remedy which empowers the trial court to correct its own record. The writ of coram nobis was given statutory recognition by the enactment of the 1949 Revision of the Wisconsin Code of Criminal Procedure. That section 958.07 of this statute provided:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|The writ of coram nobis may be issued by the trial court at any time upon the verified petition of the defendant showing sufficient grounds therefor, which may be supported by one or more affidavits. The petition and writ shall be served on the district attorney, who may move to quash the writ or make return thereto, or both. The court may hear and determine the writ either upon the affidavits submitted by the parties or upon testimony or both, in its discretion. The party aggrieved may have the determination of the trial court reviewed by the supreme court upon appeal or writ of error.}}

The Advisory Committee's comment to section 958.07 expressly acknowledged the fact that sec. 958.07 merely gave "statutory recognition to the common-law writ of coram nobis". This statute prescribed the procedure to be followed in granting the writ of coram nobis but did not state the grounds for issuing the writ, leaving that aspect to be determined from the cases.

The courts have established that the writ of coram nobis is of very limited scope. It is a discretionary writ which is addressed to the trial court.  The purpose of the writ is to give the trial court an opportunity to correct its own record of an error of fact not appearing on the record and which error would not have been committed by the court if the matter had been brought to the attention of the trial court.

In order to constitute grounds for the issuance of a writ of coram nobis there must be shown the existence of an error of fact which was unknown at the time of trial and which is of such a nature that knowledge of its existence at the time of trial would have prevented the entry of judgment. The writ does not lie to correct errors of law and of fact appearing on the record since such errors are traditionally corrected by appeals and writs of error.  Where the writ of habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen'' at 213-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner must establish that no other remedy is available. In other words, the petitioner must no longer be in custody. The petitioner must also establish the factual error that the petitioner wishes to correct must be crucial to the ultimate judgment and the factual finding to which the alleged factual error is directed must not have been previously visited or passed on by the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13451560097554862497&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

==Notable cases==

===Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu===
[[File: Korematsu Yasui Hirabayashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(L-R) [[Fred Korematsu]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]]][[Gordon Hirabayashi]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Fred Korematsu]] are best known for their principled resistance to the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]]. All three had their convictions overturned through writs of coram nobis, and they were each awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration concluded that [[Japanese Americans]] living in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] were a security threat and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which "any or all persons may be excluded". As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being forced into internment camps. Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, who were not acquainted with each other at the time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. Their convictions would be affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] between 1943 and 1944. Four decades after the Court's rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, [[Peter Irons]], re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of newly discovered evidence of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld ''The Ringle Report'', a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration's position of the military actions, as it finally concluded that most Japanese Americans in the West Coast were not a national security threat at the time of Pearl Harbor.

'''Gordon Hirabayashi''' was born in April 1918 in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. He was a senior student at the [[University of Washington]] at the time when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to internment camps. Although he first considered accepting internment, he ultimately defied it. In May 1942, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI. After being convicted in October 1942 for the [[curfew]] violation, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. He also served a one-year sentence at [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island Penitentiary]] for [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] violations when he refused to answer questions which singled out Japanese Americans on the basis of race alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2000-03/45-years-later-apology-us-government ''45 Years Later, an Apology from the U.S. Government''].

Upon the declaration of war, Yasui attempted to report for military duty, but his services were refused nine times. After hearing the news of internment, Yasui planned his legal challenge to the government's policies. In March 1942, he deliberately disobeyed the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew's constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/minoru-yasui-1916-1986/#.WENeto-cG3A Biographies: Minoru Yasui]", ''The Oregon History Project''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted in November 1942.

In December 2014, a writ of ''coram nobis'' was granted by a federal court to posthumously vacate the conviction of [[George Stinney]], a 14-year-old black boy who was convicted of murder and executed in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Campbell|title=South Carolina Judge Vacates Conviction of George Stinney in 1944 Execution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/us/judge-vacates-conviction-in-1944-execution.html|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stinney was convicted in 1944 in a one-day trial of the first-degree murder of two white girls: 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames. After being arrested, Stinney was said to have confessed to the crime; however, there was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy, and no transcript of the brief trial. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed as a result of the conviction. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was posthumously [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] 70 years after his execution, because the federal court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=wis&gt;{{cite web |last=Turnage |first=Jeremy |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |title=George Stinney, 14-year-old convicted of '44 murder, exonerated|publisher=[[WIS]] |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223031/http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The common law writ of error ''contra nobis'' and its equitable equivalent, the supplemental bill of review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; do not appear to have survived the reforms to English law made in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Writs of error as a separate proceeding were abolished by  section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict., c.76), which instead provided that "the Proceeding to Error Shall be a Step in the Cause". Error was finally abolished 23 years later in 1875, when Schedule I, Order 58, rule 1 of the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]] was brought into force and the Court of Appeal was created.

===Fresh evidence===
The modern practice at English law where a litigant seeks to rely upon evidence not known at trial is to bring an appeal.

In civil proceedings, CPR 52.11(1)(b) contains a presumption that civil appeals shall be limited to a review of a decision of the lower court, and CPR 52.11(2)(b) contains a presumption that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence. The Court of Appeal will exercise its discretion to hear fresh evidence according to the over-riding objective in civil cases to deal with cases justly: however, three key criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in ''Ladd v Marshall''&lt;ref&gt;''Ladd v Marshall'', [1954] 1 WLR 1489&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be of relevance:

*the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
*the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;
*the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed; it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.&lt;ref&gt;''Terluk v Berezovsky'' [2011] EWCA Civ 1534&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, where it is "necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice", in "exceptional" circumstances, and where "there is no alternative effective remedy", CPR 52.17(1) permits both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to re-open a final determination of an appeal.

In criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal also has a discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal.  If it does so, the Court must ask itself whether, in light of the fresh evidence, the conviction is unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, s.2(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1968; ''R. v. Pendleton'' [2002] 1 WLR 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special case of fraud===
Soon after the passage of the [[Judicature Acts]], it was thought that, when a judgment had been obtained by wilful fraud of the victorious party, the aggrieved party's proper recourse was to bring a new action for fraud, because to try the alleged fraud required original jurisdiction, which the Court of Appeal did not have.&lt;ref&gt;''Flower v. Lloyd'' (1877) 6 Ch D 297, ''per'' Jessell MR at 300, and approved by the House of Lords in ''Jonesco v Beard'' [1930] AC 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, Jessell MR made specific references to the supplemental bill of review, the equitable equivalent of the writ of error ''contra nobis.'' However, the Court drew an analogy with the old law, rather than preserving it: in agreeing with Jessell MR, James LJ observed, "if it is true that there was a fraud practised upon the Court, by which the Court was induced to make a wrong decree, the way to obtain relief will be to bring a ''fresh action'' to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud" [emphasis added].

Since the coming into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further.  In ''Noble v Owens'',&lt;ref&gt;''Noble v Owens'' [2010] 1 WLR 2491&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that the modern position is that it is now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as part of the appeal proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.&lt;ref&gt;''per'' Smith LJ, para. [29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal cases, the Court of Appeal has allowed appeals and quashed convictions on the basis of misconduct by Crown witnesses analogous to fraud, e.g., where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial;&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cummins and Perks'' (1987) 84 Cr App R 71&lt;/ref&gt; or where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Williams and Smith'' [1995] 1 Cr App R 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent attempts to resurrect the procedure===
In ''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/9.html |website=[[Bailii]] |title=''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'' [2008] EWCA Civ 9 |at=Paras. 78{{ndash}}104 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unsuccessful attempt was made to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. Jacob LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that "it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which 'entirely changes the aspect of the case{{'"}} (para. [100]). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in "exceptional circumstances" and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.

Moreover, in a Northern Ireland case, ''Walsh's Application'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm ''Walsh's Application'' &amp;#91;2012&amp;#93; NIQB 82] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an application was made for a writ of error ''coram nobis'' following an unsuccessful judicial review, Weatherup J followed the Court of Appeal in ''Cinpres'' by observing, "While the Writ developed at Common Law, I doubt if the procedure survived the appeals process introduced by the Judicature (Ireland) Act 1875", before referring to the provision of that Act dealing with the abolition of proceedings in error. The court concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to alter the decision made on judicial review.

The above cases indicate that the Judicature Acts and the Civil Procedure Rules provide for a comprehensive system of appeals which effectively ousts the function served by the former bill of review and writ of error ''coram nobis'', which may now be extinct in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The neurological nature and underlying causes of dyslexia are an active area of research, and the distinction of dyslexia as a condition is a topic of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9752.2008.00653.x|title = Does Dyslexia Exist?|journal = Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume = 42|issue = 3–4|pages = 475–491|year = 2008|last1 = Elliott|first1 = Julian G|last2 = Gibbs|first2 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{main|History of dyslexia research}}
Dyslexia was first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;BERKHAN O. Neur. Zent 28 1917&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'dyslexia' later coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rudolf Berlin: Originator of the term dyslexia |journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=January 1973|first=Rudolph|last=Wagner|volume=23|issue= 1 |pages=57–63|doi= 10.1007/BF02653841}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ophthalmologist]] practicing in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|title = Uber Dyslexie | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie | volume = 15| pages = 276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the twentieth century, dyslexia was primarily seen as a [[phonological deficit]] (specifically phonological awareness) that resulted in a reading deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christo, Catherine|author2=John M. Davis|author3=Stephen E. Brock|title=Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School.|year=2009|publisher=New York: Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ott, Philomena|title=Teaching Children with Dyslexia: A Practical Guide.|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|ISBN= 978-0415324540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|year=2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|ISBN=978-0415430784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia was seen as an issue with reading achievement specifically, caused by deficits in discrimination of written word sounds as opposed to a broader disorder of brain function. However, much research from the 1990s onward has focused on the potential biological bases of dyslexia and understanding dyslexia as a disorder of brain function. One of the first weaknesses of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis for dyslexia was its inability to account for the genetic link of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Reading Disability Research.|author1=McGill-Franzen|first=Anne|author2=Allington|first2=Richard L.|publisher=New York: Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0805853346|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it's been shown that "Relatively high heritabilities were observed for both reading ability and dyslexia indicating substantial genetic influences."&lt;ref name=PractHandbook/&gt; In a large twin study (sample 1031 twins), Gayan and Olson established that dyslexia was highly heritable, while a family study by Pennington (sample 1698 individuals) showed familial risk rates of 35-45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olson, RK|title=Reading Disability: Evidence for a Genetic Etiology|journal=European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=52–55|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1991|title=Evidence for Major Gene Transmission of Developmental Dyslexia|url=|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=266|issue=11|pages=1527–1534|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470110073036|pmid=1880884|via=|vauthors=Pennington BF, Gilger JW, Pauls D, Smith SA, Smith SD, DeFries JC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without a biological explanation for dyslexia, this heritability went unexplained. Not only must the heritability be explained, but also the environmental factors that protected at-risk children from developing dyslexia. Research began to focus on potential biological causes and to center the study of dyslexia in a developmental framework. A second major weakness of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis was its strict definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder. Consequently, the various secondary symptoms were unable to be explained, including automatization deficits of both skill and knowledge acquisition, balance impairments, motor skill/writing deficits, and muscle tone underdevelopment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; New theories of dyslexia began to be a focus of research, with the most well established being the [[biological theories of dyslexia|magnocellular deficit theory]] the [[biological theories of dyslexia|automatization deficit theory]], and the double-deficit hypothesis.&lt;ref name=PractHandbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin,|title= Dyslexia: A Practitioner's Handbook.|year=2016|publisher=Chichester : Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0470760406}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}

==Theories==
Theories of the [[etiology]] of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.

Theories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramus F, Rosen S, Dakin SC |title=Theories of developmental dyslexia: insights from a multiple case study of dyslexic adults |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=841–65 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12615643 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg076 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12615643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nicolson RI, Fawcett AJ |title=Procedural learning difficulties: reuniting the developmental disorders? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=135–41 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17328970 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.02.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebellar theory===
The '''cerebellar theory of dyslexia'''  asserts that the cause of dyslexia is an abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] (a region in the back of the brain), which in turn cause disruption in normal development, which causes issues with motor control, balance, working memory, attention, automatization, and ultimately, reading.&lt;ref name=Mody2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mody|author2=Sillman|title=Brain, Behavior, and Learning in Language and Reading Disorders|year=2008|publisher=London : The Guilford Press|isbn = 978-1593858315}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}   This theory was initially proposed by [[Harold Levinson]] and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later proposed that the [[cerebellum]] contributes to motor control during the [[Manner of articulation|articulation of speech]], and that articulation problems can contribute to the [[phonological]] processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the automatisation of learned behaviors, which may include learning the [[grapheme]]-[[phoneme]] relationships when reading text.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stoodley CJ, Stein JF |title=The cerebellum and dyslexia |journal=Cortex |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages= 101–16|date=October 2009 |pmid=20060110 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.10.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FNSage&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Reid, Gavin|title=The SAGE Handbook of Dyslexia|year=2013|isbn=9781412945134|chapter=Chapter 4:Dyslexia and the Cerebellum|first1=Angela J.|last1=Fawcett|first2=Roderick I.|last2=Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}


In attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories as well as the presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to coordinate in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g., the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g., tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

However, some have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation and phonological deficits appear unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irannejad, S.  |author2=Savage, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Is a cerebellar deficit the underlying cause of reading difficulties?|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=2012|volume=62|pages=22–52|doi=10.1007/s11881-011-0060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Catherine J.|author2=Stein, John F.|title=Cerebellar Function in Developmental Dyslexia|journal=The Cerebellum|date=1 August 2012|doi=10.1007/s12311-012-0407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ramus |first1=F. |last2=Pidgeon |first2=E. |last3=Frith |first3=U. |title=The relationship between motor control and phonology in dyslexic children |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |year=2003|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary hypothesis===
This theory considers that reading is an unnatural act carried out for a very brief period in human evolutionary history. It has only been in the last hundred years that reading a visual form of speech has been promoted as a major form of communication, and subsequently a lack of time for reading behaviors to evolve. In many societies around the world the majority of the population do not use the visual notation of speech as a form of communication and do not use reading skills, and therefore have no dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dalby JT |title=An ultimate view of reading ability |journal=The International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–30 |date=September 1986 |pmid=3759349 |doi=10.3109/00207458608985671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developmental dyslexics significantly compensate for their cerebellar-vestibular
determined symptoms and signs over time and most normal young children evidence age-appropriate "dyslexic-like" symptoms and cerebellar-vestibular(CV) "immaturities." It was thus hypothesized that genetic dyslexia may represent an [[ontogenetic]] [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]] of a pre-reading state in [[phylogeny]] and that [[ontogeny]] extended beyond the embryo into childhood and occasionally beyond, thus perhaps explaining late and even late-late blooming.&lt;ref name="Levinson2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Levinson |first=H.N. |title=The discovery of cerebellar-vestibular syndromes and therapies, a solution to the riddle dyslexia |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag; Stonebridge Publishing |pages=99–100 |year=2000 |isbn=0963930311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of reading and related writing and spelling functioning, as well as the corresponding ontogenetic CV-cerebral developmental lag hypothesis of dyslexia, is indirectly supported by studies suggesting that "the cerebellum has enlarged between three and fourfold in [only] the past million years of evolution [together with a corresponding spurt of the cerebrum]."&lt;ref name="Linas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Linas |first=R. |year=1975 |title=The cortex of the cerebellum |journal=Scientific American |volume=232 |pages=56–71 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0175-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palay"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Palay |first1=S.L. |last2=Chan-Palay |first2=V. |year=1974 |title=Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387062280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnocellular theory===
The Magnocellular theory attempts to unify the Cerebellar Theory, the Phonological Theory, the Rapid Auditory Processing Theory, and the Visual Theory.  The Magnocellular theory proposes that the [[magnocellular part|magnocellular]] dysfunction is not only restricted to the visual pathways but also includes auditory and tactile [[Stimulus modality|modalities]].&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ray NJ, Fowler S, Stein JF |title=Yellow filters can improve magnocellular function: motion sensitivity, convergence, accommodation, and reading |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1039 |issue= |pages=283–93 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15826982 |doi=10.1196/annals.1325.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2010, studies of [[Evoked_potential#Visual_evoked_potential|visual evoked potentials]] have generally supported this theory.  While some studies of contrast sensitivity have supported it. Subjects' age (10-46), differences in experimental design, small sample sizes (&lt;10 dyslexic subjects in prominent studies), and the presence, absence, or failure to assess for comorbid ADHD might explain these contradictory findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulte-Körne|first=Gerd|author2=Bruder, Jennifer|title=Clinical neurophysiology of visual and auditory processing in dyslexia: A review|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|date=1 November 2010|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1794–1809|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2010.04.028|pmid=20570212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming speed deficit and double deficit theories===
The speed with which an individual can engage in the [[rapid automatized naming]] of familiar objects or letters is a strong predictor of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel RG |title=Rapid "automatized" naming (R.A.N): dyslexia differentiated from other learning disabilities |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=471–9 |year=1976 |pmid=995240 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(76)90075-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow naming speed can be identified as early as kindergarten and persists in adults with dyslexia.

A deficit in naming speed is hypothesized to represent a deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: readers with no deficits, readers with phonological processing deficit, readers with naming speed deficit, and readers with double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits are most likely to have some sort of severe reading impairment.

Distinguishing among these deficits has important implications for instructional intervention. If students with double deficits receive instruction only in phonological processing, they are only receiving part of what they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Alphabet knowledge: letter recognition, naming and sequencing |editor=Judith R. Birsh |title=Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills |page=119 |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing |location=Baltimore, Maryland |isbn=978-1-55766-676-5 | oclc = 234335596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual visual-noise exclusion hypothesis===
The concept of a [[Perceptual noise exclusion hypothesis|perceptual noise exclusion]] deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection in the presence of perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Motion-perception deficits and reading impairment: it's the noise, not the motion |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17201786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01825.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Roach NW, Hogben JH |title=Impaired filtering of behaviourally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia |journal=Brain |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=771–85 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17237361 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl353 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17237361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to auditory discrimination tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.&lt;ref name=Sperling2005&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=862–3 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15924138 |doi=10.1038/nn1474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological deficit theory===
The [[phonological deficit]] theory proposes that people with dyslexia have a specific sound manipulation impairment, which affects their auditory memory, word recall, and sound association skills when processing speech. The phonological theory explains a reading impairment when using an [[alphabetic]] writing system which requires learning the [[grapheme]]/[[phoneme]] correspondence, the relationship between the graphic letter symbols and  speech sounds which they represent.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Rapid auditory processing theory===
The rapid auditory processing theory is an alternative to the phonological deficit theory, which specifies that the primary deficit lies in the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds. Support for this theory arises from evidence that people with dyslexia show poor performance on a number of auditory tasks, including frequency discrimination and temporal order judgment.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Visual theory===
The visual theory represents a traditional perspective of dyslexia, as being the result of a visual impairment creating problems when processing information from letters and words from a written text. This includes visual processing problems such as [[binocular vision|binocular]], poor [[vergence]], and visual crowding. The Visual Theory does not deny the possibility of alternative causes of dyslexia&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

==Research==
Various methods and models have been used to study dyslexia.

===Genetics===
High genetic concordance found in [[twin studies]] suggest a significant genetic influence on reading ability, although the degree depends on the definition of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=RK|title=Dyslexia: nature and nurture|journal=Dyslexia|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=143–159|doi=10.1002/dys.228|pmid=12222731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linkage analysis]] and [[genetic association]] studies (typically [[quantitative trait locus]] association studies, which use [[microarrays]] to look at [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] of multiple genes at once) have been used to identify [[candidate gene]]s that may be implicated in dyslexia, which have then been confirmed in various [[Knockout mouse|knockout models]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;

As of 2018 the leading candidate genes included [[DYX1C1]] on [[chromosome 15]], [[DCDC2]] and [[KIAA0319]] on [[chromosome 6]], and [[ROBO1]] on [[chromosome 3]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastry" &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shastry BS |title=Developmental dyslexia: an update |journal=J.

However, these genes account for a small proportion of variance in reading disability, often less than 0.5%.{{mcn|date=November 2018}} Additionally, the findings are not always replicated nor consistently supported by genome-wide association studies.&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt; Therefore, no single gene is definitively implicated in dyslexia. A 2007 review reported that no specific cognitive processes are known to be influenced by the proposed genes and that scientists had begun to include [[neurophysiological]] (e.g., event-related potential) and imaging (e.g., functional [[MRI]]) procedures in their [[phenotype]] characterisation of people with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schumacher J, Hoffmann P, Schmäl C, Schulte-Körne G, Nöthen MM |title=Genetics of dyslexia: the evolving landscape |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17307837 |pmc=2597981 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2006.046516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that multiple genes, as well as the environment, interact to influence reading ability. The [[Generalist Genes Hypothesis]] proposes that many of the same genes are implicated within different aspects of a learning disability as well as between different learning disabilities. Indeed, there also appear to be a large genetic influence on other learning abilities, such as language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stromswold|first=Karin|title=The Heritability of Language: A Review and Metaanalysis of Twin, Adoption, and Linkage Studies.|journal=Language|date=December 2001|volume=77|issue=4|pages=647–723|doi=10.1353/lan.2001.0247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generalist Genes Hypothesis supports the findings that many learning disabilities are [[comorbid]], such as [[speech sound disorder]], language impairment, and reading disability, although this is also influenced by diagnostic overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennington BF, Bishop DVM |title= Relations Among Speech, Language, and Reading Disorders |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year= 2009|volume=60 |pages=283–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163548|pmid= 18652545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) are the main [[neuroimaging]] methods used to study brain structure in people with dyslexia, and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) along with [[EEG]] are used to study brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soriano-Ferrer |first1=M |last2=Piedra Martínez |first2=E |title=A review of the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in the adult population. |journal=Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain) |date=undefined NaN |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50-57 |doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2014.08.003 |pmid=25444408}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual processing ===
Visual processes constitute an important part of higher cortical functioning.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vellutino|first=Frank R.|author2=Fletcher, Jack M. |author3=Snowling, Margaret J. |author4=Scanlon, Donna M. |title=Specific reading disability (dyslexia): what have we learned in the past four decades?|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=1 January 2004|volume=45|issue=1|pages=2–40|doi=10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00305.x|pmid=14959801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding and interpretation of retinal stimulation occur at the neurological level upon reception of afferent input from the eyes. Reading, for example, requires the possession of both adequate vision and the neurological ability to process what is seen. In the past, many researchers have associated anomalies in the visual system as the main cause of dyslexia. While acknowledging that most such theories are untenable, visual system deficits have been shown to contribute to symptoms of dyslexia, such as word reversal and skipping words.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt;

A small subset of dyslexic individuals have been demonstrated to have deficits in the magnocellular visual system.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=John|title=The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia|journal=Dyslexia|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12–36|doi=10.1002/dys.186|pmid=11305228}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromised magnocellular system, responsible for the processing of images with high temporal frequencies and high degree of movement, might be the main contributing factor to the reported "masking" of words reported amongst dyslexic individuals.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"/&gt; Researchers posit that such a "masking" effect is due to the abnormal longevity of the visual trace produced in the magnocellular system, resulting in a lapse in acuity as effected individuals attempt to process connected text.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt; 

Anomalies in saccadic movement, which are instantaneous, fast, oscillating eye movements essential for unimpaired reading have been observed in people with dyslexia. When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders may be due to oculo-motor deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olitsky|first=SE|author2=Nelson, LB |title=Reading disorders in children.|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=February 2003|volume=50|issue=1|pages=213–24|pmid=12713114|doi=10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read. Also, there is no evidence that children with oculomotor impariments are at risk of developing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgetts|first=DJ |author2=Simon, JW |author3=Sibila, TA |author4=Scanlon, DM |author5=Vellutino, FR|title=Normal reading despite limited eye movements.|journal=Journal of AAPOS|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=182–3|pmid=10532756|doi=10.1016/S1091-8531(98)90011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also suspected are convergence insufficiency and poor accommodation, both of which are uncommon in children, can interfere with the physical act of reading but not with decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granet|first=D.

=== Language processing ===
Brain activation studies using PET to study language have found that people with dyslexia have a deficit in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16925477 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn3001_5 |year=2006 |last1=Shaywitz |first1=BA |last2=Lyon |first2=GR |last3=Shaywitz |first3=SE |title=The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging in understanding reading and dyslexia |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=613–32 |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neural basis for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short term memory]] components have been proposed. [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] and [[Broca's area]]s are being recast in terms of localized components of [[phonological]] input and output. Some classical regions, such as the [[arcuate fasciculus]], are having their "classical" roles questioned, while other regions, such as the basal temporal language zone, are growing progressively in terms of their recognized importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9059757 |year=1997 |last1=Chertkow |first1=H |last2=Murtha |first2=S |title=PET activation and language |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=78–86 |journal=Clinical Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=November 2018}}

===Working memory ===
People with dyslexia have been commonly associated with working memory deficits, along with reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berninger|first=Virginia W. |author2=Raskind, Wendy |author3=Richards, Todd |author4=Abbott, Robert |author5=Stock, Pat|title=A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding Developmental Dyslexia Within Working-Memory Architecture: Genotypes, Phenotypes, Brain, and Instruction|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|date=5 November 2008|volume=33|issue=6|pages=707–744|doi=10.1080/87565640802418662|pmid=19005912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observed differences in the neural pattern of people with dyslexia, namely decreased activation in the left &lt;ref name="Wager 255–74"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wager|first=TD|author2=Smith, EE |title=Neuroimaging studies of working memory: a meta-analysis.|journal=Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|date=December 2003|volume=3|issue=4|pages=255–74|pmid=15040547|doi=10.3758/cabn.3.4.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posterior &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasic|first=N|author2=Lohr, C |author3=Steinbrink, C |author4=Martin, C |author5=Wolf, RC |title=Neural correlates of working memory performance in adolescents and young adults with dyslexia.|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2008-01-31|volume=46|issue=2|pages=640–8|pmid=17950764|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; midfrontal gyrus (LMG, PMG) and superior parietial regions of the brain further supports the view that deficits in working memory contribute to dyslexia. LMG and PMG are commonly associated with working memory processes such as memory updating and temporal order memory.&lt;ref name="Wager 255–74"/&gt; Behavioral experiments in dyslexia have largely been supportive of the mediating role assumed by working memory between neurological abnormalities and dyslexic behavior.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 508–11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicolson|first=RI |author2=Fawcett, AJ |author3=Dean, P|title=Developmental dyslexia: the cerebellar deficit hypothesis.|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=9|pages=508–11|pmid=11506881|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
It is difficult to control for [[confounder]]s when attempting to isolate specific causes; for example, the response to instructions by children is itself confounded by a subjects' environments, genetics and socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008/&gt;

==Controversy==

In recent years there has been significant debate on the categorization of dyslexia. In particular, Elliot and Gibbs argue that "attempts to distinguish between categories of 'dyslexia' and 'poor reader' or 'reading disabled' are scientifically unsupportable, arbitrary and thus potentially discriminatory".&lt;ref name='Elliot1'&gt;{{Cite journal

While acknowledging that reading disability is a valid scientific curiosity, and that "seeking greater understanding of the relationship between visual symbols and spoken language is crucial" and that while there was "potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future", they conclude that "there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties".

''The Dyslexia Myth'' is a documentary that first aired in September 2005 as part of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' series produced by British broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The Dyslexia Myth

 |publisher=Channel 4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing only on the reading difficulties that people with dyslexia encounter the documentary says that myths and misconceptions surround dyslexia. It argues that the common understanding of dyslexia is not only false but makes it more difficult to provide the reading help that hundreds of thousands of children desperately need. Drawing on years of intensive academic research on both sides of the Atlantic, it challenged the existence of dyslexia as a separate condition, and highlighted the many different forms of reading styles.

Julian Elliot, an educational psychologist at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom, disputes the characterization of dyslexia as a medical condition, and believes it should be treated simply as a reading difficulty.&lt;ref name='Elliot1' /&gt; According to Elliot, "Parents don’t want their child to be considered lazy, thick or stupid. If they get called this medically diagnosed term, dyslexic, then it is a signal to all that it’s not to do with intelligence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

John Everatt of the [[University of Surrey]] 2007, has suggested that:- 
*dyslexic students can be distinguished from other children with low reading achievement by testing geared to assessing their strengths as well as weaknesses
*dyslexic children tend to score significantly better than other children, including non-impaired children, on tests of creativity, [[spatial memory]], and [[spatial reasoning]]
*dyslexic children also perform better than other reading-impaired children on tests of vocabulary and listening comprehension
*dyslexic children may be better served by educational intervention which includes strategies geared to their unique strengths in addition to skill remediation
and thus recommends more comprehensive evaluation and targeted interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Ecological engineering''' uses [[ecology]] and [[engineering]] to predict, design, construct or restore, and manage [[ecosystem]]s that integrate "[[human society]] with its [[natural environment]] for the benefit of both".&lt;ref name = "Mi 98"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering", In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins, key concepts, definitions, and applications ==
Ecological engineering emerged as a new idea in the early 1960s, but its definition has taken several decades to refine, its implementation is still undergoing adjustment, and its broader recognition as a new paradigm is relatively recent. Ecological engineering was introduced by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others&lt;ref name = "Od 63"&gt;H.T. Odum et al. (1963), ''Experiments with Engineering of Marine Ecosystems'', in: ''Publication of the Institute of Marine Science of the University of Texas'', 9: 374-403.&lt;/ref&gt; as utilizing [[renewable energy|natural energy]] sources as the predominant input to manipulate and control environmental systems. The origins of ecological engineering are in Odum's work with ecological modeling and ecosystem simulation to capture holistic macro-patterns of energy and material flows affecting the efficient use of resources. 

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; summarized five basic concepts that differentiate ecological engineering from other approaches to addressing problems to benefit society and nature: 1) it is based on the self-designing [[carrying capacity|capacity of ecosystems]]; 2) it can be the field (or acid) test of ecological theories; 3) it relies on system approaches; 4) it conserves [[non-renewable energy]] sources; and 5) it supports ecosystem and [[biological conservation]].

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 89"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering" In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to define ecological engineering as designing societal services such that they benefit society and nature, and later noted&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1993), "Ecological Engineering - A Cooperative Role with the Planetary Life Support Systems" in: ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'', 27: 438-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1996), "Ecological Engineering: a new paradigm for engineers and ecologists", In: P.C. Schulze (Editor), ''Engineering Within Ecological Constraints''. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 114-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jørgensen (2003), "Ecological engineering: A field whose time has come", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 20(5): 363-377.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = "MJ 04"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (2004), "Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration". John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the design should be systems based, sustainable, and integrate society with its natural environment.  

Bergen et al.&lt;ref name = "Be 01"&gt;S.D. Bergen et al. (2001), "Design Principles for Ecological Engineering", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 18: 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt; defined ecological engineering as: 1) utilizing ecological science and theory; 2) applying to all types of ecosystems; 3) adapting engineering design methods; and 4) acknowledging a guiding value system.  

Barrett (1999)&lt;ref name = "Ba 99"&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. R. Barrett|year=1999|title=Ecological engineering in water resources: The benefits of collaborating with nature|journal=Water International|volume=24|pages=182–188|doi=10.1080/02508069908692160}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a more literal definition of the term: "the design, construction, operation and management (that is, engineering) of landscape/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities (that is, ecosystems) to benefit humanity and, often, nature."  Barrett continues: "other terms with equivalent or similar meanings include [[ecotechnology]] and two terms most often used in the [[erosion control]] field: soil bioengineering and biotechnical engineering.  However, ecological engineering should not be confused with '[[biotechnology]]' when describing genetic engineering at the cellular level, or '[[bioengineering]]' meaning construction of artificial body parts."

The applications in ecological engineering can be classified into 3 spatial scales: 1) mesocosms (~0.1 to 100s of meters); 2) ecosystems (~1 to 10s of km); and 3) regional systems (&gt;10s of km). The complexity of the design likely increases with the spatial scale. Applications are increasing in breadth and depth, and likely impacting the field's definition, as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between society and nature are explored.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Wetlands, ''Ecological Engineering'', webtext 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of ecological engineering has focused on the creation or restoration of ecosystems, from [[Land degradation|degraded]] [[wetlands]] to multi-celled tubs and [[greenhouse]]s that integrate microbial, fish, and plant services to process human [[wastewater]] into products such as fertilizers, flowers, and [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.J Todd &amp; J.

Diemont and others (2006), "Lancandon Maya Forest Management: Restoration of Soil Fertility using Native Tree Species", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 205-212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Permaculture]] is an example of broader applications that have emerged as distinct disciplines from ecological engineering, where [[David Holmgren]] cites the influence of [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] in development of permaculture.

== Design guidelines, functional classes, and design principles ==

Ecological engineering design will combine [[systems ecology]] with the process of [[engineering design]]. [[Engineering design]] typically involves problem formulation (goal), problem analysis (constraints), alternative solutions search, decision among alternatives, and specification of a complete solution.&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Krik&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal design framework is provided by Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"&gt;M.D. Matlock and others (2001), "Ecological Engineering: A Rationale for Standardized Curriculum and Professional Certification in the United States", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 17: 403-409.&lt;/ref&gt; stating the design solutions are considered in ecological time. In selecting between alternatives, the design should incorporate [[ecological economics]] in design evaluation&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and acknowledge a guiding value system which promotes biological conservation, benefiting society and nature.&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Be 01"/&gt; 

Ecological engineering utilizes [[systems ecology]] with engineering design to obtain a holistic view of the interactions within and between society and nature. Ecosystem simulation with [[Energy Systems Language]] (also known as energy circuit language or energese) by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] is one illustration of this systems ecology approach &lt;ref&gt;Brown, M.T. (2004) A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation. Ecological Modelling 178(1-2), 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;. This holistic model development and simulation defines the system of interest, identifies the system's boundary, and diagrams how energy and material moves into, within, and out of, a system in order to identify how to use renewable resources through ecosystem processes and increase sustainability. The system it describes is a collection (i.e., group) of components (i.e., parts), connected by some type of interaction or interrelationship, that collectively responds to some stimulus or demand and fulfills some specific purpose or function. By understanding systems ecology the ecological engineer can more efficiently design with ecosystem components and processes within the design, utilize renewable energy and resources, and increase sustainability.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified five Functional Classes for ecological engineering designs:
# Ecosystem utilized to reduce/solve pollution problem. Example: phytoremediation, wastewater wetland, and bioretention of stormwater to filter excess nutrients and metals pollution
# Ecosystem imitated or copied to address resource problem. Example: forest restoration, replacement wetlands, and installing street side rain gardens to extend canopy cover to optimize residential and urban cooling
# Ecosystem recovered after disturbance. Example: mine land restoration, lake restoration, and channel aquatic restoration with mature riparian corridors
# Ecosystem modified in ecologically sound way. Example: selective timber harvest, biomanipulation, and introduction of predator fish to reduce planktivorous fish, increase zooplankton, consume algae or phytoplankton, and clarify the water.
# Ecosystems used for benefit without destroying balance. Example: sustainable agro-ecosystems, multispecies aquaculture, and introducing agroforestry plots into residential property to generate primary production at multiple vertical levels.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified 19 Design Principles for ecological engineering, yet not all are expected to contribute to any single design:
# Ecosystem structure &amp; function are determined by forcing functions of the system;
# Energy inputs to the ecosystems and available storage of the ecosystem is limited;
# Ecosystems are open and dissipative systems (not thermodynamic balance of energy, matter, entropy, but spontaneous appearance of complex, chaotic structure);
# Attention to a limited number of governing/controlling factors is most strategic in preventing pollution or restoring ecosystems;
# Ecosystem have some homeostatic capability that results in smoothing out and depressing the effects of strongly variable inputs;
# Match recycling pathways to the rates of ecosystems and reduce pollution effects;
# Design for pulsing systems wherever possible;
# Ecosystems are self-designing systems;
# Processes of ecosystems have characteristic time and space scales that should be accounted for in environmental management;
# Biodiversity should be championed to maintain an ecosystem's self design capacity;
# Ecotones, transition zones, are as important for ecosystems as membranes for cells; 
# Coupling between ecosystems should be utilized wherever possible;
# The components of an ecosystem are interconnected, interrelated, and form a network; consider direct as well as indirect efforts of ecosystem development;
# An ecosystem has a history of development;
# Ecosystems and species are most vulnerable at their geographical edges;
# Ecosystems are hierarchical systems and are parts of a larger landscape;
# Physical and biological processes are interactive, it is important to know both physical and biological interactions and to interpret them properly;
# Eco-technology requires a holistic approach that integrates all interacting parts and processes as far as possible;
# Information in ecosystems is stored in structures.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified the following considerations prior implementing an ecological engineering design: 
* Create conceptual model of determine the parts of nature connected to the project;
* Implement a computer model to simulate the impacts and uncertainty of the project;
* Optimize the project to reduce uncertainty and increase beneficial impacts. 

== Academic curriculum (colleges)==

An academic curriculum has been proposed for ecological engineering,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and institutions around the world are starting programs. Key elements of this curriculum are: [[environmental engineering]]; [[systems ecology]]; [[restoration ecology]]; [[ecological modeling]]; quantitative ecology; economics of ecological engineering, and technical [[Course (education)#Elective and required courses|electives]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diemont, S.W., T.J. Lawrence, and T.A. Endreny. "Envisioning Ecological Engineering Education: An International Survey of the Educational and Professional Community", Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 570-578, 2010. DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.004 &lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this set of courses are prerequisites courses in physical, biological, and chemical subject areas, and integrated design experiences. According to Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; the design should identify constraints, characterize solutions in ecological time, and incorporate ecological economics in design evaluation. Economics of ecological engineering has been demonstrated using energy principles for a wetland.,&lt;ref&gt;S. Ton, H.T. Odum &amp; J.J. Delfino (1998),  "Ecological Economic Evaluation of Wetland Management Alternatives", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 11: 291-302.&lt;/ref&gt; and using nutrient valuation for a dairy farm &lt;ref&gt;C. Pizarro and others, ''An Economic Assessment of Algal Turf Scrubber Technology for Treatment of Dairy Manure Effluent. Ecological Engineering, 26(12): 321-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical scholarship]], the '''''editio princeps''''' ([[plural]]: ''editiones principes'') of a work is the first printed edition of the work, that previously had existed only in [[manuscript]]s, which could be circulated only after being copied by hand.

For example, the ''editio princeps'' of [[Homer]] is that of [[Demetrius Chalcondyles]], now thought to be from 1488. The most important texts of classical Greek and Roman authors were for the most part produced in ''editiones principes'' in the years on either side of 1500, following the invention of the [[printing press]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases there were possibilities of partial publication, of publication first in translation (for example from Greek to Latin), and of a usage that simply equates with [[first edition]]. For a work with several strands of manuscript tradition that have diverged, such as ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''editio princeps'' is a less meaningful concept.

The term has long been extended by scholars to works not part of the Ancient Greek and Latin literatures. It is also used for legal works, and other significant documents.

|Edited by [[Julius Pomponius Laetus]]. An undated edition, the year of print is much debated: often attributed to c. 1470, it has been countered that the printing types used do not precede 1474. Apart from this the text presented is incomplete, as it lacks Book III of ''De compendiosa doctrina'', a lacuna that was repeated in the following Venetian edition printed by [[Nicolaus Jenson]] in 1476. This was first printed in 1511 in [[Pesaro]] and edited by [[Johannes Baptista Pius]].&lt;ref name="EL69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TG25"/&gt;

|Edited by [[Ludovico Carbone]]. The edition does not include all ten books of the ''Epistulae'' but only the first seven and the ninth, for a total of 122 letters of the currently existing 375. These were increased to 236 letters in nine books with the publication of the Roman edition in 1490. Still missing was the tenth book, found by [[Giovanni Giocondo]] between 1495 and 1500 in the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]] near Paris. Giocondo made a transcription, as did briefly after another Italian, Pietro Leandro, who once returned from France gave his partial copy of the tenth book to Girolamo Avanzi who printed the new 46 letters in [[Verona]] in 1502. For an edition of all Pliny's letters it was necessary to wait 1508, when [[Aldus Manutius]] printed in Venice a complete edition taking advantage of the transcript and other Plinian manuscripts Giocondo had given him.&lt;ref name="MVA1155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGNV"&gt;{{it icon}} P.

In Paris in 1852, [[Jean Baptiste François Pitra]] in his ''Spicilegium Solesmense'' completed the ''Genesis'' and also first added ''Exodus'', ''Deuteronomy'' and ''Joshua'' plus parts of ''Leviticus'' and ''Numbers''. Pitra in 1883 in his ''Analecta sacra et classica'' published in Paris and Rome published further findings, i.e. the ''Book of Judges'' and new pieces from ''Leviticus'', ''Deuteronomy'' and ''Numbers''.&lt;ref name="quastern4-312"/&gt;

This is because the manuscripts had fused ''Agamemnon'' and ''Choephoroe'', omitting lines 311-1066 of ''Agamemnon'', a mistake that was corrected for the first time in 1552 in the Venetian edition edited by [[Francesco Robortello|Franciscus Robortellus]]. The separation was not fully successful as the text was not correctly divided, leaving it to the 1557 Paris edition by [[Petrus Victorius]], printed with an appendix by Henricus Stephanus, to finally obtain an adequate edition of Aeschylus' plays.&lt;ref name="JL98-121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grafton10-411"&gt;A.

|A part of Book VI had been already printed in Venice in 1529 by Joannes Antonius de Sabio, edited by [[Janus Lascaris]] with his Latin translation incorporated. The 1530 edition, edited by [[Vincentius Opsopoeus]], only contained Books I–V together with their Latin translation made by [[Niccolò Perotti|Nicolaus Perottus]]. What survived of the rest of Polybius thanks to the ''excerpta antiqua'' of the other Books was first printed by Joannes Hervagius in Basel in 1549 together with a Latin translation by Wolfgang Musculus. Further Polybian excerpts came to light thanks to [[Fulvio Orsini|Fulvius Ursinus]] that in Antwerp in 1582 published [[Constantine VII|Constantinus Porphyrogenitus]]' ''Excerpta de legationibus''. All this additional material was incorporated in [[Isaac Casaubon]]'s 1609 Polybius Paris edition.&lt;ref name="catalogus7-171"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[The Australian Worker|Social workers]] use [[education]] as a key tool in client and community interactions.
These educational exchanges are not always explicit but are the foundation of how social workers learn from their service participants and how social workers can assist with information delivery and skill development.

== Psychoeducation ==

One of the well-known ways in which social workers engage service participants
with valuable information is through [[psychoeducation]].&lt;ref name=Lukens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukens|first=E.P.|author2=McFarlane, W.R.|title=Psychoeducation as evidence-based practice: Considerations for practice, research, and policy|journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention|year=2004|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhh019|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychoeducation "reflects a paradigm shift to a more [[holistic]] and competence-based
approach, stressing health, collaboration, coping, and empowerment".&lt;ref name=Lukens /&gt; This method can be used
within individual and community wide interactions but consistently focuses on service
participant's strengths.&lt;ref name=Lukens /&gt; It is a model that allows the social
worker to provide the service participant with information necessary to make an informed
decision that will allow them to reach their respective goals.

== Education as a tool in community empowerment ==

Within the educational setting, social workers can provide valuable information
through Parent Universities (PU). [[Boston Public Schools|Boston Public School's]] (BPS) Focus on Children
Program facilitates a PU for parents of children in the school district.&lt;ref name=BPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Boston Public Schools|title=What is Parent University?|url=http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/parentuniversity|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PU focuses
on child development, content children are learning in school, parent and child advocacy,
parental leadership and effective parenting skills.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; The goal of the program
is to provide parents with information that is beneficial for their children's academic
success and their own personal and professional development.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; These
classes are free to all parents with children in BPS and take place on select Saturdays
throughout the year.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; A model such as this could be a great forum for social
workers, including school social workers, to work with parents in regards to their child's
academic needs.

Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights (WICIR) is an organization co-founded by [[University of Michigan]] social work professor, Laura Sanders and numerous other community volunteers.&lt;ref name=WICIR&gt;{{cite web|last=Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights|title=Take Action Now|url=http://wicir.com/index.html|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; WICIR has been instrumental in leading the immigrant rights campaign in Washtenaw County, [[Michigan]]. This organization developed a volunteer urgent response team in response to a brutal immigration raid in 2008.  It provides advocacy for families affected by increased immigration enforcement, Know Your Rights education to the immigrant community, ally education, and leads political actions toward local policy changes that affect immigrants and immigration reform.&lt;ref name="WICIR" /&gt;  Recently WICIR has provided training to empower immigrant community members to speak in public and to policy makers on behalf of policy reforms, advocate for the community and help other immigrant families. Educational materials and workshops are provided in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="WICIR" /&gt; WICIR's use of creative and empowering educational sessions, provide in both English and Spanish has allowed them to be inclusive and responsive the community's needs.

== Alternatives ==

The [[National Association of Social Workers|NASW]] Code of Ethics places emphasis on the importance of the Social
Work profession being sensitive, aware and culturally competent (1.05) while
building partnership with participants.&lt;ref name=NASW&gt;{{cite book|last=National Association of Social Workers|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|year=1996|publisher=Washington, DC.|location=Washington, DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of cultural competency is
being discussed; a new terminology suggests using cultural humility vs. cultural
competency.&lt;ref name=Tervalon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tervalon|first=M.|author2=Muray-Garcia, J.|title=Cultural Humility Versus Cultural Competency|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|year=1998|volume=9|issue=2|pages=117–125|doi=10.1353/hpu.2010.0233|pmid=10073197}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that cultural humility
is more sustainable and incorporates a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation
and growth. The importance of bringing this to attention right away is to highlight
that language use is extremely important when interacting with participants.
Checking our use of language as professionals have powerful impacts
on our relationships. Furthermore, our use of language can either perpetuate
hierarchy or help to minimize it. If our goal as Social Workers is to empower participants, minimizing hierarchy is one way to develop more meaningful and equal
relationships.

One way to limit hierarchy and [[cultural imperialism]] together is through
community or peoples education. This form of education differs from that of
dominant education by including voices that are frequently left out. This is
examined and explained in depth by the educator and philosopher Paulo Freire.
In his most influential book " Pedagogy of the Oppressed".&lt;ref name=Paulo&gt;{{cite book|last=Freire|first=Paulo|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|year=1986|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freire pioneered the
critical pedagogy movement. Rather than using a traditional top down approach
while educating, Freire believed in a bottom up approach.&lt;ref name="Paulo" /&gt; With this shift in power-
dynamics, educators including social workers will be more likely to realize the
strengths of the people they are working with, rather than assuming that as
professionals, we hold all the answers. This is extremely important for Social
Workers to be aware of, because this philosophy fosters empowerment. Our role as
Social Workers is not to simply provide services, but to help others develop positive
self-esteem.

Another example of this was [[Howard Zinn]]'s "A People's History of America".
Zinn believed that the dominant narrative being taught in schools was excluding
the voice and contributions of marginalized populations.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of America|year=1995|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While looking for ways to
incorporate people's education, one tool that exists is the Zinn Education Project.
On this website educators can find critical resources which focus on the voices of
oppressed and marginalized groups.  This website contains hundreds of resources
free of charge. Using tools such as this are beneficial for both the Social Worker and
the participant.

When facilitating or participating in education that challenges dominant narratives, it is
important to be aware of one's own social identity. Our identities are extremely
complex and intersect with various aspects of our [[ascribed status]] (one assigned to
you) and our achieved status (one that is "earned"). Reflecting and analyzing our
own identities and status can help us foster a deeper understanding and respect for
those around us. Being critical is an absolute necessity when engaging in alternative
narratives.

While facilitating or educating it is important to set the mood of the group.
This is usually done through having an icebreaker before beginning the educational
activity. This helps individuals warm up and get to know each other before
discussing difficult issues, such as ones that challenge the dominant narrative.
Many resources exist for icebreakers, but you can also develop your own based on
your education plan and the group you are working with. After the discussion it is
important to have some sort of closure for the group. Discussing alternatives to a
dominant narrative can be eye opening, empowering or uncomfortable for some.
It is beneficial to discuss how individuals are feeling so that you can tailor future
discussions to the needs of the group.

== Skills and tools for social workers that educate ==

Several organizations provide supplemental materials and guides for social work professionals that educate. Some of the most comprehensive resources are available from university social work departments and non-profit organizations. Some examples of this include the Council on Social Work Education and the [[State University of New York]] School of Social Work. The CSWE Gero-Ed Center lists a practice guide for social workers educating certain or audiences that includes class exercises, assignments, case studies, and history.

=== Council on Social Work Education ===

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a non-profit association partnership of educational and professional institutions that works to ensure and enhance the quality of social work education and for a practice that promotes individual, family, and community well-being, and social and economic justice.&lt;ref name=CSWE&gt;{{cite web|last=Council on Social Work Education|title=Teaching Tools|url=http://www.cswe.org/CentersInitiatives/GeroEdCenter/TeachingTools.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association provides various training for community education in a social work setting.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; For instance, the CSWE Gero-Ed Center lists a practice guide for social workers educating certain populations or audiences that includes class exercises, assignments, case studies, and competencies history.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt;

The material provided explains the benefits of each activity style and what a group would gain from its implementation. Many of the class exercises resemble community education events and are intended to provide insight into what educational styles may be best for the social worker's topic of interest or population.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; A policy analysis at a community agency meeting may call for an educational activity that divides the attending into groups to advocate for the interests of other community members or agencies. This type of activity, as described by the CSWE, allows for free discussion of intergenerational, multicultural, political issues associated with that policy.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; This tool is among many others the CSWE provides for social workers that educate.

=== The State University of New York School of Social Work ===

For social workers that are new to educating, the State University of New York School of Social Work provides a great resource that can help each educator find their own style of teaching. They explain that teaching is as much of an art and that social workers, as educators, needs to understand themselves and their students.&lt;ref name=Buffalo&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Buffalo|title=Teaching Resources|url=http://www.socialwork.buffalo.edu/facstaff/teaching.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the identified tools provided by the School of Social Work include finding one's own learning style, how to develop effective lesson plans, reflective teaching and professional development, resources by subject, and solution-focused teaching among others.&lt;ref name="Buffalo" /&gt;

Reflective teaching is one promoted aspect that describes the responsibility of the social worker to create an environment for creative problem solving. It allows for room to consider more alternatives and develop a body of knowledge based on experiences.&lt;ref name=Brazeau&gt;{{cite web|last=Brazeau|first=G|title=Reflection teaching: A valuable tool for teaching, learning and professional development|url=http://www.socialwork.buffalo.edu/facstaff/documents/Reflection_Teaching_Brazeau-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social work setting this attempt to community education can prove to be most effective as our environments and populations are constantly changing. Reflecting and monitoring the educational process can help to stabilize more creative and innovative ways to educate individuals, families, and communities.&lt;ref name=Brazeau /&gt; As social and economic justice issues become more prominent and delicate, social workers need to consider these tools for the benefit of help seekers.

'''Electronic engineering''' (also called '''electronics and communications engineering''')  is an [[electrical engineering]] discipline which utilizes nonlinear and [[active component|active]] electrical components (such as [[semiconductor device]]s, especially [[transistors]], [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuits]]) to design [[electronic circuit]]s, [[electronic device|devices]], [[VLSI]] devices and their [[electronic system|systems]]. The discipline typically also designs [[passive component|passive]] electrical components, usually based on [[printed circuit board]]s.

Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as [[analog electronics]], [[digital electronics]], [[consumer electronics]], [[embedded systems]] and [[power electronics]]. [[Electronics]] engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example [[solid-state physics]], [[radio engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[control systems]], [[signal processing]], [[systems engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[instrumentation engineering]], [[electric power control]], [[robotics]], and many others.

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) is one of the most important and influential organizations for electronics engineers.

== Relationship to electrical engineering ==
Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject. An academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be acquired from some universities, while other universities use electrical engineering as the subject. The term [[electrical engineer]] is still used in the academic world to include electronic engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Hambley ''Electrical Engineering'', pp. 3, 441, Prentice Hall, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-13-147046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people consider the term 'electrical engineer' should be reserved for those having specialized in power and heavy current or high voltage engineering, while others consider that power is just one subset of electrical engineering, as well as '[[electrical distribution]] engineering'. The term '[[power engineering]]' is used as a descriptor in that industry.  Again, in recent years there has been a growth of new separate-entry degree courses such as '[[systems engineering]]' and '[[communication systems engineering]]', often followed by academic departments of similar name, which are typically not considered as subfields of electronics engineering but of electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6dEAAAAIAAj&amp;dq=electrical+vs+electronic+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Principles of Electrical Engineering |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pansini ''Electrical Distribution Engineering'', p. xiv, The Fairmont Press Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-88173-546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of electronic engineering}}
Electronic engineering as a profession sprang from technological improvements in the [[telegraph]] industry in the late 19th century and the [[radio]] and the [[telephone]] industries in the early 20th century. People were attracted to radio by the technical fascination it inspired, first in receiving and then in transmitting. Many who went into broadcasting in the 1920s were only 'amateurs' in the period before [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Barnouw ''A Tower in Babel'', p. 28, Oxford University Press US, 1966 {{ISBN|978-0-19-500474-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent, the modern discipline of electronic engineering was born out of telephone, radio, and [[television]] equipment development and the large amount of electronic systems development during [[World War II]] of [[radar]], [[sonar]], communication systems, and advanced munitions and weapon systems. In the interwar years, the subject was known as [[radio engineering]] and it was only in the late 1950s that the term '''electronic engineering''' started to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=radio+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Radio Engineering Principles |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronics ==
{{main|Electronics}}
In the field of electronic engineering, engineers design and test [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] that use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] properties of [[electrical element|electrical components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality. The [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner circuit]], which allows the user of a radio to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit.

In designing an integrated circuit, electronics engineers first construct circuit [[schematic]]s that specify the electrical components and describe the interconnections between them. When completed, [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] engineers convert the schematics into actual layouts, which map the layers of various [[conductor (material)|conductor]] and [[semiconductor]] materials needed to construct the circuit. The conversion from schematics to layouts can be done by [[software]] (see [[electronic design automation]]) but very often requires human fine-tuning to decrease space and power consumption. Once the layout is complete, it can be sent to a [[fabrication plant]] for manufacturing.

For systems of intermediate complexity, engineers may use [[VHDL]] modeling for [[programmable logic device]]s and [[FPGA]]s.

[[Integrated circuit]]s, [[FPGAs]] and other electrical components can then be assembled on [[printed circuit board]]s to form more complicated circuits. Today, printed circuit boards are found in most electronic devices including [[television]]s, [[computer]]s and [[digital audio player|audio player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Harper ''High Performance Printed Circuit Boards'', pp. xiii-xiv, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-07-026713-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==

Electronic engineering has many subfields. This section describes some of the most popular subfields in electronic engineering; although there are engineers who focus exclusively on one subfield, there are also many who focus on a combination of subfields.

'''Signal processing''' deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]]. Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information.

For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[audio filter|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error checking]] and [[error detection]] of digital signals.

'''Telecommunications engineering''' deals with the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[channel (communications)|channel]] such as a [[coax cable|co-axial cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space]].

Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier wave]] in order to shift the information to a [[carrier frequency]] suitable for transmission, this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]]. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]]. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

'''Electromagnetics''' is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves, Transmission Lines and [[Waveguides]], Antennas, its types and applications with [[Radio frequency|Radio-Frequency]] (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.

'''Control engineering''' has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airplanes]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile|cars]]. It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in a [[automobile|car]] with [[cruise control]], the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|engine's]] power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

'''Instrumentation engineering''' deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Mass flow rate|flow]] and [[temperature]]. These devices are known as [[instrumentation]].

The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[radar gun]]s use the [[Doppler effect]] to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier–Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.

'''Computer engineering''' deals with the design of [[computer]]s and computer systems. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]]. Development of [[embedded systems]]—systems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)—is also included in this field.  This field includes the [[micro controller]] and its applications.
Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.

'''VLSI design engineering''' [[VLSI]] stands for ''very large scale integration''. It deals with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components.

== Education and training ==

Electronics engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electronic engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science]], or [[Bachelor of Technology]] depending upon the university.  Many UK universities also offer [[Master of Engineering]] ([[MEng]]) degrees at the graduate level.

Some electronics engineers also choose to pursue a [[postgraduate]] degree such as a [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Engineering, or an [[Engineering Doctorate]]. The master's degree is being introduced in some European and American Universities as a first degree and the differentiation of an engineer with graduate and postgraduate studies is often difficult. In these cases, experience is taken into account. The master's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia.

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. Certification allows engineers to legally sign off on plans for projects affecting public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tryengineering.org/ask-expert/are-there-any-professional-examinations-available-electronics-and-telecommunications |title=Are there any professional examinations available in the electronics and telecommunications engineering field? Where do I get the listings of these examinations, and how do I apply for them? Who is eligible to write such examinations? |access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements, including work experience requirements, before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada, and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the European Union).

A degree in electronics generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[project management]] and specific topics in [[electrical engineering]]. Initially, such topics cover most, if not all, of the subfields of electronic engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subfields towards the end of the degree.

Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] and [[simulation software]] programs when designing electronic systems. Although most electronic engineers will understand basic circuit theory, the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanic]]s and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with [[embedded systems]].

Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to ''electronics'' engineering course. ''Electrical'' engineering courses have other specialisms such as [[machines]], [[power generation]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]. This list does not include the extensive [[engineering mathematics]] curriculum that is a prerequisite to a degree.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh K. Garg/Ashish Dixit/Pavan Yadav ''Basic Electronics'', p. 1, Firewall Media, 2008 {{ISBN|978-81-318-0302-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachin S.

== Professional bodies ==

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) (now renamed the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] or IET). Members of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (MIET) are recognized professionally in Europe, as Electrical and computer (technology) engineers. The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature in electrical/electronic engineering, has over 430,000 members, and holds more than 450 IEEE sponsored or cosponsored conferences worldwide each year. [[SMIEEE]] is a recognised [[professional designation]] in the United States.

== Project engineering ==
For most engineers not involved at the cutting edge of system design and development, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time is also spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason, project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.

The workplaces of electronics engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electronics engineers may be found in the pristine laboratory environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or in a research laboratory. During their working life, electronics engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers and other engineers.

Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electronics engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. And these are mostly used in the field of consumer electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;Homer L. Davidson, ''Troubleshooting and Repairing Consumer Electronics'', p. 1, McGraw–Hill Professional, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-07-142181-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European University Institute''' ('''EUI''') in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], is an international [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] and [[postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] teaching and research institute established by [[European Union]] [[European Union member states|member states]] to contribute to cultural and scientific development in the social sciences, in a European perspective.

==History and member states==
The European University Institute (EUI) has been founded in 1972 by the Member States of the European Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/servizi/stranieri/opportunita/progetti-speciali/istitut_europeo_firenze.html
|title=European University Institute|publisher=Farnesina|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was born out of an atmosphere of cooperation, with notable advocacy for a European institute at the Hague Conference in 1948 and the European Cultural Conference the following year.

Other priorities persisted however until the 1955 Messina Conference; a series of constructive talks responding to the widening of Europe. With all six members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) were present, the German Secretary of State Walter Hallstein took the opportunity to call for a training centre for nuclear sciences. This was proposed under the Euratom Treaty which had established Europe's atomic energy community; Hallstein's vision would create an instrument of integration and move away from the nationalism of the past.

The Italian government was enthusiastic and, recognising an academic need to study Europe, made determined action along with the European Commission and the European Parliament. However it was not until over a decade later that the idea began to bear fruit, when in 1969 leaders met in The Hague and resolved to fund a European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. By this point the idea had evolved from a centre for nuclear sciences to one focused on the human sciences, promoting a cultural exchange between member states.

Plans were put into motion with conferences in Florence and Rome in 1970 and 1971, when it was decided that the institute would be reserved for post-graduate studies and not directly a Community institution.

The six member states – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – signed a convention in 1972 which cemented their commitment to creating the EUI as a pillar for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1436893428665&amp;uri=CELEX:41976A0209(01)|title= Convention setting up a European University Institute|year=1976 |accessdate=|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=С|number=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the Community and became involved in founding the Institution.

The EUI opened its doors to its first 70 researchers in 1976. The mission, laid down in the 1970s, is to “foster the advancement of learning in fields which are of particular interest for the development of Europe”.

{{as of|2018|June}}, the EUI Member States are:

==Departments and centres==
===Department of Economics===
The Economics Department provides teaching and supervision to PhD students. The research activities of the Department reflect the interests of the faculty and are concentrated in micro, macro and econometrics. Weekly research seminars are given by scholars from around the world. The teaching in the doctoral programme is based on formal coursework at a level which will allow researchers to pursue academic careers in universities or to follow professional opportunities in international organisations. In their third and fourth years researchers work on their thesis projects under the guidance of their supervisor while attending research workshops and seminars.

===Department of History and Civilization===
The Department of History and Civilization (HEC) offers a programme of transnational and comparative European history. The doctoral programme studies the construction of Europe's boundaries and the diversity and complexity of experiences within them.

The department's central concerns are the interlinking of European societies since the Renaissance and the complex cultural legacies that have shaped contemporary Europe. The HEC community is also committed to exploring the place of Europe in the world through the study of empires, global processes and institutions.

The variety of research approaches and themes, as well as the broad background of its professors, enable the Department to recruit high-quality Ph.D. candidates and to host outstanding research fellows.

===Department of Law===
The Department of Law is European and international in character. It is committed to the study of law in a comparative and contextual manner, with a special focus on European and international law.

Courses and seminars are interactive, research-oriented and designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work. Researchers gain experience in presenting their work, and are encouraged to participate in conferences, workshops and the Department's Working Groups.

Within the department, the Academy of European Law (AEL) offers advanced-level summer courses in Human Rights Law and EU Law. It also manages research projects and runs a publications programme.

The EUI Law Department also jointly hosts, with Harvard Law School, the Summer School on Law and Logic.  This summer school was launched in 2012 and is also sponsored by CIRSFID-University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), the European Academy of Legal Theory, and a grant from the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme.

===Department of Political and Social Sciences===
The research programme of the Department of Political and Social Sciences (SPS) places emphasis on political and social change within Europe at the national, sub-national and transnational level.
The research interests of the Department range across the four sub-disciplines of comparative politics, sociology, international relations, and social and political theory.
 
Courses in both quantitative and qualitative methods are available as options in the first and second year, while field work and data collection normally take place in the second and third year.

===Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies===
The Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies was launched by the European University Institute in 1993 building up on the experience of an already existing Policy Unit, created by [[Joseph Weiler]]. It is named for [[Robert Schuman]]. The first Director of the newly established Centre was {{illm|Yves Mény|fr||it}} (1993-2001), followed by [[Helen Wallace]] (2001-2006), {{ill|Stefano Bartolini|de}} (2006-2013) and Brigid Laffan (2013-). The initial set up was rather modest: one director, one assistant and two secretaries, but over the years the Centre has grown into a large research centre pursuing interdisciplinary research into the key political challenges facing Europe and the EU today and bringing together academics and practitioners, in both policy dialogues and executive training. The Centre's mission is to “contribute to research on the major issues facing contemporary European society, including questions associated with the construction of Europe.”
The Centre has several main programmes.

====Global Governance Programme====
The Global Governance Programme brings together academics, diplomats, public officers and officials from international organisations to connect the worlds of research and policy-making. It tackles a wide range of issues, including human rights, international trade, development, climate change, internet governance and regional integration.

The programme hosts a series of events, including High-Level Policy Seminars, where participants can exchange ideas.

====Florence School of Regulation====
The [http://fsr.eui.eu/ '''Florence School of Regulation'''] (FSR) is a centre of excellence for independent research, training and policy dialogue. The FSR has been founded in 2004 as a partnership between the EUI's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, the Council of the European Energy Regulators (CEER) and the Independent Regulators Group (IRG). The school also works closely with the [[European Commission]].

The FSR organises '''policy events''' dealing with key regulatory issues, provides academic '''training for practitioners''', produces regulation '''research''' and promotes networking and the exchange of ideas in the areas of:

* [http://fsr.eui.eu/energy/ Energy and Climate] 
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/communications-media/ Communications and Media]
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/transport/ Transport]
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/water/ Water]

Policy and business decision-makers, regulators, regulated companies and academics from different countries are encouraged to share their experiences through the school.

====European Union Democracy Observatory====
The European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO), launched in 2006, is an independent and interdisciplinary academic organisation whose goal is to produce an assessment of democratic practices within the EU. EUDO gathers documentation and data, provides basic and applied research reports for EU institutions, and fosters dialogue between policy-makers, academics and EU citizens.

====Migration Policy Centre====
The Migration Policy Centre has been founded in January 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-is-new/news/news/2012/20120625_en
|title=New Migration Policy Centre|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducts advanced policy-oriented research on global migration, asylum and mobility. It serves governance needs at European and global levels, from developing, implementing and monitoring migration-related policies to assessing their impact on the wider economy and society.

====Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom====
The Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF) was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Co-financed by the European Union, it is composed of experts in legal studies, new media policies, media markets and economics, political science and political communications. 
Through its programme of research, debate, training and dissemination of results, the CMPF works with academics, policy makers, regulators, market stakeholders, journalists and others interested in the debate.

== Historical Archives of EU ==

The [[Historical Archives of the European Union]] (HAEU) preserves and makes accessible the documents produced by the European Union's institutions according to the thirty year rule governing public access to archival material. The HAEU was established following decisions of the European Coal and Steel Community's (ECSC) and the Council in 1983 to open their historical archives to the public. An agreement between the European Commission and the European University Institute in 1984 led to the creation of the HAEU. The Archives are administered by the EUI and are operative in Florence since 1986.

==Doctoral and master programmes==

===[http://www.eui.eu/Phd/ Doctoral Programme]===
The EUI prepares researchers for developing and defending a doctoral thesis in the fields of economics, history and civilization, law, and political and social sciences. Around 150-160 research grants are awarded annually by the EU Member States and other European national authorities to successful candidates. A Ph.D. from the European University Institute is an internationally recognised qualification.

While each department structures its own four-year programme, in all researchers are involved in seminars and other events where they are encouraged to participate and present their work. During their Ph.D. students may travel within the EU and further afield to conduct research, while there are also exchange opportunities.

====Grants and fees====
There are  funding options available to researchers, with the majority of EU member states offering grants which cover living costs and tuition fees. There are additional agreements with non-EU member states, while the Italian and Spanish ministries of foreign affairs provide grants to a number of countries. Academics not covered by grants pay €12,000 each year in tuition fees and be able to guarantee at least €1,200 monthly to cover living costs, although fees may be reduced or waived for candidates from developing countries.

===[https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/MasterofLaws/LL.M.Programme Masters Programme in Law]===
Since 1984 the European University Institute has offered law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of '''Master in Comparative, European and International Law''' ([[LL.M.]] degree level).

===Languages===
The majority of students and professors are multilingual; all are required to have a good knowledge of English although French and Italian are also regular working languages and the Institute is committed to accommodating other languages where possible.

==Postdoctoral fellowships==
The EUI has several post-doctoral fellowships in the [[social sciences]]

===Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellowships===

The Max Weber Programme is Europe's largest postdoctoral programme in the social sciences and is funded by the European Commission.

Max Weber Fellowships are designed for junior post-docs who would like to pursue an academic career, concentrate on their own research and enhance their academic practice in a multidisciplinary environment. Max Weber Fellowships are for one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate in the social sciences (economics, law, political science, sociology, history and related fields) within the last five years.

===Jean Monnet Fellowships===
Through its Jean Monnet Fellowship Programme the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies offers fellowships to mid- and late-career scholars (while previously the Jean Monnet was a post-doctoral fellowship, it is now available only to those who received their PhD at least five years prior). During their stay at the RSCAS, fellows work on a research topic that fits well in the overall research profile of the RSCAS and participate in the academic life of the Centre and of the EUI. Jean Monnet Fellowships have a duration of one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate more than five years prior.

===Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships===
Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships provide a framework for established academics with an international reputation to pursue their research at the EUI. Fellowships last for up to ten months in one of the EUI's four Departments which in turn invite fellows to participate in departmental activities (seminars, workshops, colloquia, etc.).

===Marie Curie Fellowships===
The EUI (the Departments and the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies) acts as a host institution for Marie Curie Fellowships which are awarded by the European Commission.

===Canon Foundation Fellowships===
The Canon Foundation and the EUI jointly award one Canon Foundation Fellowship each year for post-doctoral research at the EUI. The fellowship is open to candidates of Japanese nationality or permanent residents of Japan.

===Academy of Finland Fellowships===
The Academy of Finland awards fellowships for post-doctoral research at the EUI. A project to be funded shall serve Finnish research and society or international collaboration.

===Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc===
The Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc awards annually one six-month Postdoctoral Fellowship for the period January–June. The Postdoctoral Fellowship is available to those who have graduated with a PhD qualification within the last five years, and is open only to Australian citizens or residents employed in Australian universities.

==Rankings==
The EUI is one of the leading [[social science]] research institutions in Europe, and with around 1,000 researchers at various levels in their careers also one of the largest [[graduate schools]]. The EUI Political and Social Science department was ranked first in Europe and fifth worldwide in the Hix ranking of such departments (which was published in 2004 and covered the period 1998–2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf Simon Hix (2004) 'A Global Ranking of Political Science Departments', Political Studies Review 2(3) 293-313.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041221043317/http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf |date=December 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the same department was included in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;'CHE Excellence Ranking'&lt;/nowiki&gt; for political science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excellenceranking.org/eusid/EUSID CHE Excellence Ranking 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expectancy violations theory''' ('''EVT''') is a theory of [[communication]] that analyzes how individuals respond to unanticipated violations of social [[Norm (social)|norms]] and expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Hale|first2=J.L.|title=Nonverbal Expectancy Violations: Model Elaboration and Application to Immediacy Behaviors|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1988|volume=55|pages=58–79|doi=10.1080/03637758809376158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Judee K. Burgoon]] in the late 1970s and continued through the 1980s and 1990s as "nonverbal expectancy violations theory", based on Burgoon's research studying [[proxemics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=Judee|title=Applying a comparative approach to nonverbal expectancy violations theory|year=1992|publisher=Sage|pages=53–69|url=}} In J. Blumler, K. E. Rosengren, &amp; J. M. McLeod (Eds.), Comparatively speaking: Communication and culture across space and time (pp. 53–69). Newbury Park, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoon's work initially analyzed individuals' allowances and expectations of personal distance and how responses to personal distance violations were influenced by the level of liking and relationship to the violators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Jones|first2=S.B.|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|date=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was later changed to its current name when other researchers began to focus on violations of social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal communication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Relational quality and relationships: An expectancy violations analysis|last = Guerrero|first = L.K.|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|doi = 10.1177/0265407506070476|pmid = |first2 = G.F.|last2 = Bachman |volume=23 |issue = 6|pages=943–963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory sees communication as an exchange of behaviors, where one individual's behavior can be used to violate the expectations of another. Participants in communication will perceive the exchange either positively or negatively, depending upon an existing personal relationship or how favorably the violation is perceived.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.

Beyond proxemics and examining how people interpret violations in many given communicative contexts, EVT also makes specific predictions about individuals' reaction to given expectation violations: individuals reciprocate or match someone's unexpected behavior, and they also compensate or counteract by doing the opposite of the communicator's behavior.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Mark|last2=Stukas|first2=Arthur A.|year=1999|title=Interpersonal Processes: The Interplay of Cognitive, Motivational, and Behavioral Activities in Social Interaction|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=273–303|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.273|pmid=10074680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The expectancy violations theory examines three main components in interpersonal communication situations:  Expectancies, communicator reward valence, and violation valence.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|last1=Griffin|first1=Em|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0073534305|edition=8|location=|pages=84–92|chapter=Chapter 7: Expectancy Violations Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectancy ===

Expectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] of the communicators.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=M. B.|last2=Yuhua|first2=J. L.|year=2007|title=Students' Reactions to Teachers' Management of Compulsive Communicators|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=56|issue=|pages=18–33|doi=10.1080/03634520601016178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoon (1978) notes that people do not view others' behaviors as random. Rather, they have various expectations of how others should think and behave. EVT proposes that observation and interaction with others leads to expectancies. The two types of expectancies noted are predictive and prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Houser"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=2005|volume=53|issue=2|pages=217–218|doi=10.1080/01463370500090332|url=|author=M. L. Houser|location=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive expectations are "behaviors we expect to see because they are the most typical," (Houser, 2005) and vary across cultures.&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; They let people know what to expect based upon what typically occurs within the context of a particular environment and relationship.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; For example, a husband and wife may have an evening routine in which the husband always washes the dishes. If he were to ignore the dirty dishes one night, this might be seen as a predictive discrepancy. Prescriptive expectations, on the other hand, are based upon "beliefs about what behaviors should be performed" and "what is needed and desired" (Houser, 2005).&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; If a person walks into a police department to report a crime, the person will have an expectation that the police will file a report and follow up with an investigation.

When the theory was first proposed, EVT identified three factors which influence a person's expectations:  Interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=S. B. Jones|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and Their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|year=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nonverbal Expectancies and the Evaluative Consequences of Violations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 232–265|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00232.x|first = Judee K.|last = Burgoon|first2 = Joseph B.|last2 = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction.  Interaction variables include [[social norms]], purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;

These factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4129-7737-1|page=91|author=L. K. Guerrero|edition=3rd |author2=P. A. Anderson |author3=V. A. Afifi|chapter=Making Sense of Our World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt; Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and dominance effect immediacy behaviors.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silent Messages|last = Mehrabrian|first = A.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Belmont, CA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediacy cues such as conversational distance, lean, body orientation, gaze, and touch may differ between the genders as they create psychological closeness or distance between the interactants.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

[[Behavioural]] expectations may also shift depending on the environment one is experiencing. For example, a visit to a church will produce different expectations than a social function. The expected violations will therefore be altered. Similarly, expectations differ based on culture. In [[Europe]], one may expect to be greeted with three kisses on alternating cheeks, but this is not the case in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Assess, Don't Assume, Part I: Etiquette and National Culture in Negotiation|date=2009|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=37171}} Harvard Business School Working Paper, No. 10-048.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communicator reward valence  ===

The communicator reward valence is an evaluation one makes about the person who committed a violation of expectancy. Em Griffin summarizes the concept behind Communicator Reward Valence as "the sum of positive and negative attributes brought to the encounter plus the potential to reward or punish in the future".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;  The [[social exchange theory]] explains that individuals seek to reward some and seek to avoid punishing others.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=R. L.|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year=2007|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|isbn=9780073135618|page=188|edition=3rd|author2=L. H. Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one individual interacts with another, Burgoon believes he or she will assess the "positive and negative attributes that person brings to the encounter".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  If the person has the ability to reward or punish the receiver in the future, then the person has a positive reward valence. Rewards simply refer to the person's ability to provide a want or need. The term 'communicator reward valence' is used to describe the results of this assessment.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  For example, people will feel encouraged during conversation when the listener is nodding, making eye contact, and responding actively. Conversely, if the listener is avoiding eye contact, yawning, and texting, it is implied they have no interest in the interaction and the speaker may feel violated.

When examining the context, relationship, and communicator's characteristics in a given encounter, individuals will arrive at an expectation for how that person should behave. Changing even one of these expectancy variables may lead to a different expectation.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010/&gt;

=== Violation valence ===

Behavior violations arouse and distract, calling attention to the qualities of the violator and the relationship between the interactants.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = W. A. | last2 = Metts | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 365–392 | doi=10.1177/0265407598153004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key component of EVT is the notion of violation [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], or the association the receiver places on the behavior violation.&lt;ref name="Houser, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houser | first1 = M. L. | year = 2005 | title = Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Non Traditional Students | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 213–228 | doi=10.1080/01463370500090332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A violatee's response to an expectancy violation can be positive or negative, and is dependent on two conditions:  positive or negative interpretation of the behavior and the nature (rewardingness) of the violator.  Rewardingness of the violator is evaluated through many categories – attractiveness, prestige, ability to provide resources, or associated relationship.  For instance, a violation of one's personal distance might have more positive valence if committed by a wealthy, powerful, physically appealing member of the opposite sex than a filthy, poor, homeless person with foul breath. The evaluation of the violation is based upon the relationship between the particular behavior and the valence of the actor.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt;  A person's preinteractional expectancies, especially
personal attributes, may cause a perceiver to evaluate the communication behavior
of a target differently in terms of assigning positive and negative valenced expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00316.x|title = Effects of Communication Expectancies, Actual Communication, and Expectancy Disconfirmation on Evaluations of Communicators and Their Communication Behavior|journal = Human Communication Research|volume = 20|pages = 67|year = 1993|last1 = Burgoon|first1 = Judee K.|last2 = Le Poire|first2 = Beth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective of violation valence is that the perceived positive or negative value assigned to a breach of expectations is inconsequential of who the violator is.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; This perspective places much greater weight on the act of the breach itself than the violator.  The difference between the negative violation and the negative confirmation do not appear significant. Dis-confirmations tend to intensify the outcomes, especially in the positive violation condition.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dainton|first1=Marianne|last2=Zelley|first2=Elaine D.|title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life: A Practical Introduction|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1412976916|pages=48–49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arousal ===
Expectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. The term 'arousal value' is used to describe the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;

When [[arousal]] occurs, one's interest or attention to the deviation increases, resulting in less attention paid to the message and more attention to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Poire|first1=Beth A.|last2=Burgoon|first2=Judee K.|year=1996|title=Usefulness of differentiating arousal responses within communication theories: Orienting response or defensive arousal within nonverbal theories of expectancy violation|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=63|issue=3|pages=208–230|doi=10.1080/03637759609376390}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of arousals. Cognitive arousal is an idea that people will be mentally aware of the violation. Physical occurs when people have body actions and behaviors in response to the deviations from their expectations.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner" /&gt;

=== Threat threshold ===
The occurrence of arousal is aligned with threats. Burgoon introduced the term "threat threshold" to explain that people have different levels of tolerance about distant violations. The threat threshold is high when people feel good even if they keep a very close distance with the violator, whereas people with low threat threshold will be sensitive and uncomfortable about the closeness of distance with the violator.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;

== Theoretical assumptions and viewpoints ==

=== Propositions ===
After assessing expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of a given situation, it becomes possible to make rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L. K. | last2 = Burgoon | first2 = J. K. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment Styles and Reactions to Nonverbal Involvement Change in Romantic Dyads Patterns of Reciprocity and Compensation | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 335–370 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. For example, your boss gives you a big smile after you have given a presentation. Guerrero and Burgoon would predict that you would smile in return. Similarly, if you perceive the violation valence as negative and perceive the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that you reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant towards you, you will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return.

Conversely, if one perceives a negative violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, it is likely that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, one day your boss appears sullen and throws a stack of papers in front of you. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that you will compensate for your boss' negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero &amp; Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the "benefit of the doubt."&lt;ref name="Dainton2010" /&gt;

The assumptions discussed thus far can be summarized into six major propositions posited by Expectancy Violations Theory:&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Burgoon, J. K., Stern L. A., &amp; Dillman, L. (1995). Interpersonal adaptation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# People develop expectations about verbal and nonverbal [[communication]] behavior from other people.
# Violations of these expectations cause arousal and distraction, further leading the receiver to shift his or her attention to the other, the relationship, and the meaning of the violation.
# Communicator reward valence determines the interpretation of ambiguous communication.
# Communicator reward valence determines how the behavior is evaluated.
# Violation valences are determined by three factors:  (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) whether or not the behavior is more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation.  A positive violation occurs when the behavior is more favorable than the expectation.  A negative violation occurs when the behavior is less favorable.
# Positive violations produce more favorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations, and negative violations produce more unfavorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations.

=== Needs for personal space and affiliation ===

Expectancy violations theory builds upon a number of communication [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT assumes that humans have two competing needs:  A need for personal space and a need for [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; Specifically, humans all need a certain amount of personal space, also referred to as distance or privacy.&lt;ref name=Burgoon,1978 /&gt; People also desire a certain amount of closeness with others, or affiliation.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT seeks to explain 'personal space', and the meanings that are formed when expectations of appropriate personal space are infringed or violated.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt;

Another feature of personal space is [[territoriality]]. Territoriality refers to behavior which "is characterized by identification with a geographic area in a way that indicates ownership" (Hall, 1966).&lt;ref name=Hall,1966&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E. T.|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0385084765|pages=113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, territoriality refers to an individual's sense of ownership over physical items, space, objects or ideas, and defensive behavior in response to territorial invasions.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality involves three territory types:  Primary territories, secondary territories and public territories.&lt;ref name=Altman,1975&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=I.|title=Environment and social behavior: Privacy, personal space, territory, and crowding|year=1975|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|location=Monterey, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary territories are considered exclusive to an individual.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Secondary territories are objects, spaces or places which "can be claimed temporarily" (Hall, 1966), but are neither central to the individual's life nor are exclusively owned.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt;  Public territories are "available to almost anyone for temporary ownership".&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality is frequently accompanied by prevention and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0534625634|page=124|author=M. L. Knapp|edition=6th|author2=J. A. Hall|chapter=The Communication Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an individual perceives one of their needs has been compromised, EVT predicts that they will react. For instance, when an offensive violation occurs, the individual tends to react as though protecting their territory.

=== Proxemics ===
EVT offers an opportunity to study how individuals communicate through personal space. This part of the theory explains the notion of "[[personal space]]" and our reactions to others who appear to "violate" our sense of personal space.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=J.|title=Nonverbal communication|year=1989|publisher=Harper&amp;Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we define as personal space, however, varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The "success" or "failure" of violations are linked to perceived attraction, credibility, influence and involvement. The context and purpose of interaction are relevant, as are the communicator characteristics of gender, relationships, status, social class, ethnicity and culture.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89" /&gt; When it comes to different interactions between people, what each person expects out of the interaction will influence their individual willingness to risk violation. If a person feels comfortable in a situation, they are more likely to risk violation, and in turn will be rewarded for it.

Introduced by [[Edward T. Hall|Edward Hall in 1966]], [[Proxemics]] deals with the amount of distance between people as they interact with one another.&lt;ref name="Edward Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Edward|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial distance during an interaction can be an indication of what type of relationship exists between the people involved.

]]

There are 4 different personal zones defined by Hall. These zones include:

# '''Intimate Distance:''' ''(0-18 inches)'' - This distance is for close, intimate encounters. Normally core family, close friends, [[Sexual partner|lovers]], or [[pet]]s. People will normally share a unique level of comfort with one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com"&gt;http://proxemics.weebly.com/types-of-proxemics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Personal Distance:''' ''(18 inches – 4 feet)'' - Reserved for conversations with [[friendship|friends]], [[extended family]], associates, and group discussions. The personal distance will give each person more space compared with the intimate distance, but is still close enough to involve touching one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt;
# '''Social Distance:''' ''(4–10 feet)'' - This distance is reserved for newly formed groups, and new acquaintances and colleagues you may have just met. People generally do not engage physically with one another within this section.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt; 
# '''Public Distance:''' ''(10 feet to infinity)'' - Reserved for a public setting with large [[audience]]s, strangers, [[Public speaking|speeches]], and [[theater]]s. 
&lt;ref name="Edward Hall" /&gt;

Many different cultures are influenced by [[Proxemics]] in different ways and respond differently to the same situation. In some cultures, those who have not formed close relationships may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, engaging one another well within the intimate range of proxemics.  In other cultures, a custom greeting is a handshake which maintains a physical separation but is well within personal distance.&lt;ref&gt;http://proxemics.weebly.com/proxemics-and-culture.html&lt;/ref&gt; Across the [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] Zones, actions can be interpreted differently among different cultures. For example, Japanese people do not address others by their first names unless they have been given permission. Calling someone by their first name in Japan without permission is considered an insult. In the Japanese culture, they address people using their last name and [[Japanese honorifics|'san']], which is equivalent to 'Mr.','Mrs.' and 'Ms.' in the English language. The way Japanese people address each other is an example of a verbal [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] zone. A Japanese person allowing another to call them by their first name is an example of intimate distance, because this is a privilege extended only someone very close to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://maki.typepad.com/justhungry/2009/08/when-to-use-chan-or-san-and-other-ways-to-address-people-in-japan-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Interpersonal communication ===
It is important to note that EVT can apply to both non-relational interaction and close relationships.  In 1998, more than twenty years after the theory was first published, several studies were conducted to catalog the types of expectancy violations commonly found in close relationships.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt; Expectations with friends formulate over time and are usually brought together by a series of observations of behavior and predictions on how that friend will act in the future. When these expectations are violated, it often can be damaging and dangerous for a close friendship. It can cause an end to the friendship and bring a strong negative experience in that person's life. After time and experiences with that friend we might suspect them to act consistently around me in the way they have always acted, that is until a violation to this expectation takes place. For example, when they begin “breaking promises or even acting in an inauthentic manner to impress others, can have aversive consequences for close relationships” (Cohen 2010).  The fact is, we expect our friends to act in a social manner where they are adhere to all of our personal rules we set in our minds. That includes being nice, kind, considerate, and refraining from any comment that puts another down. This is a part of the personal rules we set within ourselves with a personal friendship, that is until we are in a different setting with that individual and they are around different people and the rules are broken. While this might be an offense in one’s eyes, it may not be offensive in the others. Each negative experience can deteriorate the relationship and allow more experiences where expectations are continually violated until the relationship is dissolved.   Cohen said “the more that a friendship is voluntary, easily replaceable, and disconnected from external pressures to continue, the more vulnerable it is to expectancy violation damage” (Cohen, 2010). Someone will always look for the better option if a negative experience has taken place. The more you are invested in a friendship with someone the stronger the effect will have on the individual when expectations are violated. There is also an interesting perspective of expectation violation when you throw gender into the picture. A friend that shares the same sex as you usually has a completely different feel to the relationship than a friendship with members of the opposite sex. Women are generally less tolerant with members of the opposite sex when violations have taken place. Relationships over time, whether it be with the same sex or not, tend to fail when the other will fall away from the behaviors and norms that the other is used to. This can be shown with hostile attitudes, sharp comments, distancing away from the other, etc. Both parties are also capable of violating each other's expectations at the same time. It is not just one person in the relationship that perceives behavior as unusual. One can respond to a violation with another social violation, leaving the friendship in confusion of direction it is going. 
 Participants in friendships and romantic relationships were asked to think about the last time their friend or partner did or said something unexpected. It was emphasized that the unexpected event could be either positive or negative. Participants reported events that had occurred, on average, five days earlier, suggesting that unexpected behaviors happen often in relationships. Some of the behaviors reported were relatively mundane, and others were quite serious. The outcome of the list was a list of nine general categories of expectation violations that commonly occur in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Afifi|first=Walid|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publication|pages=93|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JCDc0f4AGb0C&amp;pg=PA92|isbn=9781412977371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Support or confirmation'' is an act that provides social support in a particular time of need, such as sitting with a friend who is sick.
# ''[[Criticism]] or accusation'' is critical of the receiver and accuse the individual of an offense.  These are violations because they are accusations not expected.  An example is a ball player telling a teammate he should have caught the ball rather than supportively giving him or her a slap on the back and offering words of encouragement.  
# ''Relationship intensification or escalation'' intensifies the commitment of the communicator.  For instance, saying "I love you" signifies a deepening of a romantic relationship.
# ''Relationship de-escalation'' signifies a decrease in commitment of the communicator.  An example might be spending more time apart.
# ''[[Relational transgressions]]'' are violations of the perceived rules of the relationship.  Examples include having an affair, deception, or being disloyal.
# ''Acts of devotion'' are unexpected overtures that imply specialness in the relationship.  Buying flowers for no particular occasion falls into this category.
# ''Acts of disregard'' show that the partner is unimportant.  This could be as simple as excluding a partner or a friend from a collective activity.
# ''Gestures of inclusion'' are actions that show an unexpected interest in having the other included in special activities or life.  Examples include invitations to spend a special holiday with someone, disclosure of personal information, or inviting the partner to meet one's family.
# ''Uncharacteristic relational behavior'' is unexpected action that is not consistent with the partner's perception of the relationship.  A common example is one member of an opposite-sex friendship demanding a romantic relationship of the other.

In later review of the studies, the ''support or confirmation'' category was inserted into ''acts of devotion'' and included another category, ''uncharacteristic social behavior''.  These are acts that aren't relational but are unexpected, such as a quiet person raising his or her voice.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2001"&gt;Guerrero, L. K., Andersen, P. A., &amp; Afifi, W. A. (2001). Close Encounters: Communicating Relationships. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the response to expectancy violations, the sensitivity of expectancy violations varies from genders. Research found that women are less tolerant than men when their expectation are violated by negative behaviors, regardless of the types of violations such as dishonesty and immorality.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elizabeth L.|date=2010-05-07|title=Expectancy Violations in Relationships with Friends and Media Figures|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824091003737836|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=27|issue=2|pages=97–111|doi=10.1080/08824091003737836|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Romantic relationships ====
[[File:Romantic sunset Couple romance - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Application in interpersonal relationships-romantic relationships]]
Expectancy violations happen frequently in [[Romance (love)|romantic relationships]]. In relationships there is an unspoken expectation when interacting and that is the significant other will give their full undivided attention when in the presence of their significant other. As the new generation evolves we can see the face to face contact has changed. Unfortunately, with the access use of phones and social media the attention of individuals has shifted to their devices and continues to become worse. With the access to many mobile devices there has been an increase of lack of communication face to face. This has made it difficult for some relationships to grow and or has created conflict because the expectation of attention has been shifted. "Individuals expect conversational partners to be moderately involved in an interaction (Burgoon, Newton, Walther, &amp; Baesler, 1989). Within existing relationships, partners rely on one another to show interest and immediacy in interactions (White, 2008). However, the presence of cell phones and the expectation to be constantly available (Ling, 2012) impacts partners' abilities to give full attention to one another" (Miller-Ott, A., &amp; Kelly, L. 2015).

When romantic partners spend time together, both prefer gaining attention, intimacy, and feeling a close connection with each other. However, the usage of cell phones acts as a distractive behavior that drives romantic partner's attention to absent elements. Although romantic partners are more likely to be viewed as high reward communicators, their cell phone usage behaviors will be evaluated as negative in certain conditions and contexts.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Lynne|last2=Miller-Ott|first2=Aimee E.|last3=Duran|first3=Robert L.|date=2017-10-20|title=Sports Scores and Intimate Moments: An Expectancy Violations Theory Approach to Partner Cell Phone Behaviors in Adult Romantic Relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570314.2017.1299206|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=81|issue=5|pages=619–640|doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1299206|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of where the romantic relationship takes place, people are likely to have negative valence about cell phone usage if their demand of attention and intimacy are violated.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The negative behaviors include texting, viewing news and playing games. In addition, large quantity of annoying cell phone usage during the date has great impact on romantic partner's negative valence towards the violated behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, Miller-Ott and Kelly found that small amount of cell phone usage during date is acceptable, such as responding to a text message and quickly bringing attentiveness back to the date partner.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller-Ott|first=Aimee|last2=Kelly|first2=Lynne|date=2015-08-08|title=The Presence of Cell Phones in Romantic Partner Face-to-Face Interactions: An Expectancy Violation Theory Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1041794X.2015.1055371|journal=Southern Communication Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=253–270|doi=10.1080/1041794x.2015.1055371|issn=1041-794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same behavior in different occasions and contexts is viewed differently in terms of the degree of valence. Research found that same behavior is viewed as more negative in a restaurant than at home.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Since people are more likely to have higher expectations for undivided attention during formal contexts, using cell phone in formal dates will more negatively violate partner's expectations. Divided attention is acceptable in casual contexts – therefore, the degree of expectancy violations is low under a hanging out context.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Cell phone usage =====
Cell phone usage behaviors that do not contradict intimate moment are viewed as positive violations, including sharing interesting messages and playing online games together. People have less negative valence on cell phone usage if they gain more reward from the behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Research also found the most common response to the violated cell phone usage is to do nothing.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, people have different reactions to the violations under different stages of romantic relationships. In the early stage of [[dating]], people are more likely to respond by indirect messages and silence. While there are direct verbal responses when expectations are violated in established relationships.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Sexual resistance =====
Sexual resistance is viewed as a typical expectancy violation in romantic relationships. In 2003, Bevan used EVT to evaluate the impact of sexual resistance on close relationships. The research focused on two considerations: relational contexts and directness of the messages.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|date=March 1, 2013|title=Expectancy violation theory and sexual resistance in close, cross-sex relationships|url=|journal=Communication monographs|volume=70 |issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1080/0363775032000104603|issn=0363-7751|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research concluded that people who are resisted in a romantic relationship perceived the violation of sexual resistance as more negative and unexpected than those resisted in a regular cross-sex friendship. The reason might because romantic partners believe that they have clearer and deeper understanding of each other's expectations and degree of acceptance and tolerance. When it comes to message directness of sexual resistance, although the study did not find any significant difference of levels of violation valence and expectedness between direct and indirect messages, direct sexual resistance messages in close relationships proved to be more relationally important than indirect messages. Therefore, direct sexual resistance messages will be a harmful factor that affects the continuity of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

=== Computer-mediated communication and social media ===
As has previously been addressed, EVT has evolved tremendously over the years, expanding beyond its original induction when it focused on FtF communication and proxemics. The advancement of [[information and communications technology]] has provided tools for expressing oneself and conveying messages beyond just typing in text.  As already discussed, arousal can divert one's attention or interest from a message
to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Virtual realities
created online through [[computer-mediated communication]], especially those which evoke
strong visual presence through media, can increase arousal levels, such as those
with high violent or sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence|url = |journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date = 1997-09-01|pages = 0|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x|first = Matthew|last = Lombard|first2 = Theresa|last2 = Ditton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just
as people may use television viewing to increase or decrease arousal levels, people
may use media in online communication to increase or decrease arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Responding to the Screen: Reception and reaction processes|last = Zillmann|first = D.|publisher = Erlbaum|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Hillsdale, NJ|pages = 103–134|work = Television and physiological arousal|editor-last = Bryant|editor-first = J.|editor-last2 = Zillmann|editor-first2 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People may interact with others online by assuming
the identities of [[Avatars United|avatars]] which may take on completely different, alternate personalities.
The differences in perceived intimateness, co-presence, and emotionally-based trust can very significantly between avatar communication and other communication modalities such as text chat, audio, and audio-visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Avatar-Mediated Networking: Increasing Social Presence and Interpersonal Trust in Net-Based Collaborations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 2008-04-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 287–318|volume = 34|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.2008.00322.x|first = Gary|last = Bente|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Rüggenberg|first3 = Nicole C.|last3 = Krämer|first4 = Felix|last4 = Eschenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The media options available to users when communicating
with others online present a host of potential expectancy violations unique to CMC.

The introduction of social media networks such as [[Facebook Home|Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as dating social networks such as [[Match.com]] and [[eHarmony]], has greatly contributed to the increased use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) which now offers a context for studying communication devoid of nonverbal information. Though these media are relatively new, they have been in existence long enough for users to have developed norms and expectations about appropriate behaviors in the online world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/98060925|title = When You Stalk Me, Please Don't Tell Me About It: Facebook and Expectancy Violation Theory|last = Fife|first = Eric M.|date = Spring 2009|journal = The Kentucky Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015|last2 = Nelson|first2 = C. Leigh|issue = 1|volume = 28|pages = 41–54|issn = 1533-3140|first3 = Kristine|last3 = Bayles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there has been a lag by researchers to study and understand these new established norms, which makes CMC rich with heuristic possibilities from a communications theory perspective.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Ramirez and Wang studied the occurrence and timing of modality switching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.020 | volume=29 | issue=4 | title=When online meets offline: A field investigation of modality switching | journal=Computers in Human Behavior | pages=1565–1571| year=2013 | last1=McEwan | first1=Bree | last2=Zanolla | first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; or shifts from online communication to FtF interaction, from the perspective of EVT.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Online Meets Offline: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective on Modality Switching|url =|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2008-03-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 20–39|volume = 58|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00372.x|first = Artemio|last = Ramirez|first2 = Zuoming|last2 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research documented inconsistent findings which revealed in some instances relationships were enhanced and in others they were dampened, indicating the expectations, evaluations, and outcomes associated with initial modality switches varied amongst individuals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Additionally, studies have found that when individuals who meet online meet face-to-face for the first time, the length of time spent communicating online can determine whether individuals will rate physical characteristics of each other positively or negatively.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Unlike FtF communication, CMC allows people to pretend to be connected with a person who violates their expectancy by ignoring violations or filtering news feed. Meanwhile, people can also cut the connection completely with someone who is not important by deleting friendship status when a serious violation occurs. A confrontation is much more likely for close friends than for acquaintances, and compensation is much more likely for acquaintances, a finding which contrasts typical EVT predictions.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Norm evolution and violation on Facebook|url = |journal = New Media &amp; Society|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1461-4448|pages = 299–315|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1461444811412712|first = Caitlin|last = McLaughlin|first2 = Jessica|last2 = Vitak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, EVT on the Internet environment is strongly related to online privacy issues.

==== Facebook ====
[[File:Facebook logo.png|thumb|Application in computer-mediated communication and social media-Facebook]]
In social media such as Facebook, people are connected online with friends and sometimes strangers. Norm violations on Facebook may include too many status updates, overly emotional status updates or Wall posts, heated interactions, name calling through Facebook's public features, and tags on posts or pictures that might reflect negatively on an individual.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Research has also shown that the act of unfriending on Facebook is perceived as a highly negative expectancy violation, with the duration of the Facebook friendship and personal ties to the unfriending party dictating how negatively the act is perceived. Moreover, the importance of the violation was also found to dictate whether the unfriending person informed the other individual of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Being unfriended on Facebook: An application of Expectancy Violation Theory|url = |journal = Computers in Human Behavior|date = 2014-04-01|pages = 171–178|volume = 33|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.029|first = Jennifer L.|last = Bevan|first2 = Pei-Chern|last2 = Ang|first3 = James B.|last3 = Fearns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Fife, Nelson, and Bayles of focus groups from a Southeastern liberal arts university, five themes were ascertained regarding Facebook use and expectancy violations:&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* ''""Don't stalk' – and when you do, don't talk about it"''
** Though an understanding exists among Facebook participants that users will use the site to keep track of the behavior of others in a number of ways, excessive monitoring is likely to be perceived as an expectancy violation.
* "''Don't embarrass me with bad pictures''"
** Users may have the ability to control which pictures they post on their own Facebook page, but they do not have the ability to control what others post.  Posting and "tagging" unflattering pictures of others may create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't mess up my profile''"
** Several participants expressed annoyance of others who alter their profiles knowing that their alterations could be perceived negatively, though they did not mention changing their passwords or protecting themselves in other ways.
* "''Choose an appropriate forum for messages''"
** Messages can be sent between Facebook participants through 'Facebook messages', which are not public, or 'wall postings', which can be viewed by anyone specified in the user's privacy controls.  Posting messages which may be perceived as private, embarrassing, or inappropriate to a wall posting can create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't compete over number of friends''"
** Facebook users maintain a running total of 'friends' on their profile which is viewable to others.  Engaging in comparisons with others over this statistic can create expectancy violations. 
In 2010, Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield examined college undergraduates' motivations to have friends-only profiles on Facebook. Having a friends-only profile is a practical method to enhance privacy management on Facebook. The two authors made distinctions between intended audience, to whom one hopes to disclose the Facebook profile, and expected audience, a group of people by whom one thinks the Facebook profile has been viewed.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutzman|first=Fred|last2=Kramer-Duffield|first2=Jacob|date=2010|title=Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-enhancing Behavior in Facebook|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1753326.1753559|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1553–1562|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753559|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicated that "expectancy violations were identified as instances where an expected audience was not jointly identified as an intended audience".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Facebook networks were categorized into different levels: strong ties of family and intimate friends, weak ties comprising "casual friends and campus acquaintances", and outsiders such as "faculty or administrators". According to the study, expectancy violations by weak ties showed greater relevance to the establishment of a friends-only profile among college undergraduates, compared to other Facebook network ties.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Electronic mail ====
[[Email]] has become one of the most widely used methods of communication within [[Organizational communication|organizations]] and workplaces.  When discussing expectancy violations
with electronic e-mail, just as with other modes of communication, a distinction
must be made between inadvertent violations of norms and purposeful violations,
referred to as '[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Sullivan|first=Patrick B.|last2=Flanagin|first2=Andrew J.|date=2003|title=Reconceptualizing 'flaming' and other problematic messages|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|edition=1|location=London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=5|pages=69–94|doi=10.1177/1461444803005001908|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = November 13, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Flaming
is defined as hostile and aggressive interactions via text-based CMC.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

One form of expectancy violation in email is the length of time between the sending of the initial email and the receiver's reply. Communicator reward valence plays a large part in how expectancy violations are handled in email communications. In computer-mediated communication, people have expectations to others’ online behaviors based on individual identity. In online contexts, violations are not simply assessed as positive or negative. Some violations are ambiguous such as e-mail response latency. In 2017, Nicholls and Rice stated that “when deviation is ambiguous, the communicator’s reward value will mediate the perceptions of the deviation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Spencer Byron|last2=Rice|first2=Ronald E.|date=2017-08-01|title=A Dual-Identity Model of Responses to Deviance in Online Groups: Integrating Social Identity Theory and Expectancy Violations Theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/comt.12113/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=243–268|doi=10.1111/comt.12113|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronemics|Chronemic]] studies on email have shown that in organizations, responder status played a large part in how individuals reacted to various lapses in response to the previously sent email.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

McPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of norm violations|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/social/examples_of_norm_violations.htm|publisher=Radford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Dark Side of Instruction: Teacher Anger as Classroom Norm Violations|url = |journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 0090-9882|pages = 76–90|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00909880305376|first = Mary B.|last = McPherson|first2 = Patricia|last2 = Kearney|first3 = Timothy G.|last3 = Plax}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time.  How teachers express themselves and convey those
emotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations.
The students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Students rated the aggressive expressions as
highly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as [[sarcasm]] or putdowns (most
frequently cited), [[verbal abuse]], rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advice for New Faculty Members|last = Boice|first = R.|publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Needham Heights, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Classroom incivilities|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1996|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf01730110|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 4|pages = 453–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Faculty development via field programs for middle-aged,  disillusioned faculty|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1986|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf00991486|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 115–135|publication-date = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Teacher dress ====
[[Clothing]] is considered a form of nonverbal communication. [[Dress]] communicates status, [[hierarchy]], [[credibility]], and attractiveness. Specific social codes dictate what forms of dress are appropriate in various cross-cultural contexts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Clothing and Teacher Credibility: An Application of Expectancy Violations Theory|last = Dunbar|first = Norah|date = 2011|journal = ISRN Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.5402/2012/140517|pmid = |volume = 2012|last2 = Segrin|first2 = Chris |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Influence of Dress on Perceptions of Intelligence and Expectations of Scholastic Achievement|last = Behling|first = D.U.|date = 1991|journal = Clothing and Textiles Research Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0887302x9100900401|pmid = |last2 = Williams|first2 = E.A.|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals wear clothing that is deemed inappropriate for a given situation, or when an individual's clothing does not seem to match their perceived status or attractiveness, this can constitute an expectancy violation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Studies on clothing and teacher perceptions have shown that when teachers wear [[Formality|formal]] attire, students rate their credibility higher. However, for high-reward teachers, clothing formality did not raise perceptions of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Appropriateness and Promotability of Clothing Behavior of Women Teachers|last = Fitch|first = E.M.|publisher = Yeshiva University|year = 1984|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effects of Source Attire on Judgments of Credibility|last = Bassett|first = R.E.|date = 1984|journal = Central States Speech Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/10510977909368022|pmid = |volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 282–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students seem to retain information best when teachers are dressed moderately, and teacher value appears to derive from what grade students predict they will get from a teacher more so than clothing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Instructor credibility in college classroom ====
Generally, students have expectations to their instructors in college classroom. According to Sidelinger and Bolen, students might be dissatisfied about instructors who talk a lot during class.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidelinger|first=Robert J.|last2=Bolen|first2=Derek M.|date=2016-01-02|title=Instructor Credibility as a Mediator of Instructors’ Compulsive Communication and Student Communication Satisfaction in the College Classroom|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2015.1117438|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–31|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1117438|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they did the research about the compulsive communication and communication satisfaction, they concluded that if an instructor is evaluated as credible by the students, his credibility decreases students’ dissatisfaction despite of his talkativeness. Particularly, instructor’s goodwill such as [[politeness]] and care for students is the most effective characteristic to alleviate students’ negative feelings towards a talkative instructor.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==== Course ratings ====
Most American colleges and universities employ course rating surveys as a method to gauge teacher effectiveness and the degree to which students are satisfied with the pedagogy of their professors. Expectancy violation and violation valence play a part in course ratings because a wide range of expectancies exist for students while taking a course.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectations, Observations, and Violations: Comparing Their Effects on Course Ratings|last = Gigliotti|first = R.J.|date = 1987|journal = Research in Higher Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.1007/bf00992374|pmid = |volume = 26|issue = 4 |pages=401–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common expectancies for students include stimulation and interest, instructor behavior, relevance of the course, and the student's expected and actual success in the course. A higher education study on EVT and course ratings analyzed 228 students in seven introductory sociology classes at a university of 25,000 students.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since the courses were required for most students, were open to all students, used the same textbook, and met for the same length of time during the semester, expectancy violations in the classroom could be reported more accurately.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some factors used to report the data included instructor personality, interestingness and informativeness of textbook materials, difficulty of lectures, lecturer speaking ability, and the ability to answer questions. At the end of the study, the only factor that affected course ratings was relevance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Expectancies had virtually no effect otherwise on course evaluations. This reason could be attributed to the fact that students who found a course highly relevant were already interested in the subject area and were more motivated to do well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Nontraditional college students ====
EVT has been used to study the experiences of [[Non-traditional student|non-traditional]] [[college]] and [[university]] students who begin an [[undergraduate education]] over the age of 25.  The study focused on the students' expectations of their professors and how they should behave in the classroom. Since nontraditional students often feel that they are different from their academic peers, and since the traditional university setting focuses on the 18-23-year-old [[Demographics|demographic]], studying nontraditional student classroom experiences can help higher education institutions instruct teachers on how to behave in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectancy Violations as Predictors of Motivation and Learning: A Comparison of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|last = Houser|first = Marian|date = 2006|journal = Communication Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/01463370600878248|pmid = |volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 331–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Adult Learner: A Neglected Species, 2nd Edition|last = Knowles|first = M.S.|publisher = Gulf Publishing|year = 1978|isbn = |location = Houston, TX|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional and non-traditional students have been shown to expect teachers to make use of examples, provide feedback, and adequately prepare them for exams.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both traditional and non-traditional students have been found to have their expectations for instructor clarity negatively violated.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Surprisingly, non-traditional students differed from traditional students by responding negatively to affinity-seeking behaviors and believed that instructors should be less concerned with making class more fun and enjoyable.

==== Student disclosures in college classroom ====
In 2013, Frisby and Sidelinger conducted a research about student disclosures in college classroom, which discussed about what kinds of student disclosures would violate peers’ expectations and their perceptions about the disclosers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisby|first=Brandi N.|last2=Sidelinger|first2=Robert J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Violating Student Expectations: Student Disclosures and Student Reactions in the College Classroom|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510974.2012.755636|journal=Communication Studies|volume=64|issue=3|pages=241–258|doi=10.1080/10510974.2012.755636|issn=1051-0974}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, those who make inappropriate disclosures violate others’ expectations most in a classroom environment. Inappropriate disclosures are described as high frequent, negative, offensive and irrelevant topics. Disclosers of inappropriate information are more likely to be described as incompetent students, and they are less likeable than students who disclose appropriate information that are related to course materials.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==== College admissions ====
A 2008 study of the top 500 US colleges by Kaplan found that 10% of admissions offices checked applicants' social networking site (SNS) profiles, and 38% of those saw information that reduced the applicants' prospects for admission.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;  In 2011, a college student was cited for underage drinking after campus police found pictures on Facebook of
the student holding a beer.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
[[File:Profaneco.png|thumb|Application in profanity use]]

=== Profanity use ===
Swearing and cursing are some of the most readily observable instances of verbal expectancy violations. Examples of swearing expectancy violations include U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy, Senator of Vermont, to "go fuck yourself",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
|url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/25/cheney.leahy/|title = Cheney Says He Felt Better After Cursing at Leahy|last = |first = |date = June 25, 2004|work = |accessdate = |agency = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Swearing by Peers in the Work Setting: Expectancy Violation Valence, Perceptions of Message, and Perceptions of Speaker|last = Johnson|first = D.I.|date = 2012|journal = Communication Studies|doi = 10.1080/10510974.2011.638411|pmid = |volume = 63|issue = 2|pages = 136–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; actor Christian Bale's lashing out toward a bystander who walked in front of the camera while he was filming,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's remarks during a live broadcast of his speech congratulating U.S. President Barack Obama on passage of the health care reform bill, commenting that it was a "big fucking deal".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com|title = Vice President Biden Caught on Mic: Calls Health Care a "Big F-ing Deal"|last = Sheridan|first = M.|date = March 23, 2010|work = |accessdate = |publisher = |newspaper = New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expletives also vary among different cultures, so valence of expectancy violations involving swearing may differ when used in different contexts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== In workplaces ====
Swearing is common among many workplaces. Swearing has been identified functionally as one of several ways to express emotion in response to workplace stress, to convey verbal aggression, or to engage in deviant workplace behavior (Johnson, 2012). In formal work settings, people have much stronger feelings that their expectations are violated by swearing than in casual occasions. Expletives are more prevalent in unstructured conversations than in more structured, task-oriented ones (Johnson, 2012). The use of [[profanity]] has been shown to influence the perceptions of speakers. It may also have emotional impact on the user and the audience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reactions to Obscene Language|last = Hamilton|first = M.A.|date = 1989|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824098909359835|pmid = |volume = 6|pages = 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What the ____ Is Your Problem?: Attribution Theory and Perceived Reasons for Profanity Usage During Conflict|last = Young|first = S.L.|date = 2004|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824090409359998|pmid = |volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 338–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that profanity users appear less trustworthy, less sociable, and less educated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why We Curse|last = Jay|first = T.|publisher = John Benjamins|year = 1999|isbn = 9781556197581|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more swearing messages one expresses that violate respondent's expectations in workplaces, the more negative evaluations the respondent will generate about the speaker's incompetency.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Danette Ifert|last2=Lewis|first2=Nicole|date=2010-10-13|title=Perceptions of Swearing in the Work Setting: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08934215.2010.511401|journal=Communication Reports|volume=23|issue=2|pages=106–118|doi=10.1080/08934215.2010.511401|issn=0893-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits are likely to appear as fixed among profanity users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Moreover, the content of the swearing messages also poses great impact on the extent of expectancy violations in formal work settings. The verbal messages include words related to sex, [[excretion]] and profaneness. Research found that respondents experience highest level of surprise about the swearing with sexual expressions. Thus their expectations are more likely to be violated by sexual swearing than excretory and profane words. A more productive approach than focusing on whether a specific word is offensive may be to make sure that those engaging in workplace swearing are aware of how they and their messages might be perceived in multiple ways (Johnson, 2012).&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Evaluation of media figures ===
Expectancy violations are tightly related to the changes of people's evaluation on their relationships with media figures. In 2010, Cohen made comparisons between relationships with friends and media figures in order to find similarities and differences of people's reactions when their expectations are violated in these two relationships. Violations were generally divided in three categories: social violations such as making offensive comments, trust violations such as making up stories about their life experience, and moral violations such as cheating in a marital relationship or drunk driving.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Research indicated that in both friendships and relationships with media figures, social and trust violations are more offensive than moral violations. Specifically, people are more intolerable about moral violations from media figures than from their friends. According to the study, the reason for the intolerance is because relationships with media figures are relatively weak that people invest less on the relationships with media figures than on friendships.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;
The type of media figures is also an important factor to determine the changes of closeness with media figures. People have different expectations to various types of media figures. Research discussed that moral violations negatively influence relationships with athletes, damaging their positive and energetic appearance expected by the public. Social violations reduce closeness with TV hosts, whom people expect as amiable public figures.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Health and self-improvement ===
Expectancy violation theory has even been applied to encouraging healthy habits and changing bad ones. In a study by Karolien van den Akker,  Myrr van den Broek, Remco C. Havermans, and Anita Jansen, expectancy violation theory was tested to see if it was successful in changing ingrained cravings for chocolate. Although researchers did not find that expectancy violation mediated responses to chocolate cravings, they believe more research is needed to determine whether this theory is profitable for this kind of application to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Akker|first=Karolien|last2=Broek|first2=Myrr van den|last3=Havermans|first3=Remco C.|last4=Jansen|first4=Anita|title=Violation of eating expectancies does not reduce conditioned desires for chocolate|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.004|journal=Appetite|volume=100|pages=10–17|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metatheoretical assumptions ==

=== Ontological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that humans have a certain degree of free will.  This theory assumes that humans can assess and interpret the relationship and liking between themselves and their conversational partner, and then make a decision whether or not to violate the expectations of the other person. The theory holds that this decision depends on what outcome they would like to achieve.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=White, C. H.|title=Adaptation and communicative design|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2001|volume=27|issue=1|pages=9–37|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00774.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assumption is based on the ''interaction position''. The interaction position is based on a person's initial stance toward an interaction as determined by a blend of personal Requirements, Expectations, and Desires (RED). These ''RED'' factors meld into our interaction position of what's needed, anticipated, and preferred.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"/&gt;

=== Epistemological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that there are norms for all communication activities and if these norms are violated, there will be specific, predictable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt; EVT does not fully account for the overwhelming prevalence of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] that has been found in interpersonal interactions. Secondly, it is silent on whether communicator valence supersedes behavior valence or vice versa when the two are incongruent, such as when a disliked partner engages in a positive violation.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt;

=== Axiological assumptions ===

This theory seeks to be value-neutral as supporting studies have been conducted empirically and sought to objectively describe how humans react when their expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;

== Critique ==

=== Predictability and testability ===
Expectancy violations theory has undergone scrutiny for its attempt to provide a covering law for certain aspects of interpersonal communication. Some critics of EVT believe most interactions between individuals are extremely complex and there are many contingencies to consider within the theory. This makes the prediction of behavioral outcomes of a particular situation virtually impossible to consistently predict.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts|last=Miller|first=K.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2005|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique of the theory is the assumption that expectancy violations are mostly highly consequential acts, negative in nature, and cause uncertainty to increase between communicators.  In actuality, research shows expectancy violations vary in frequency, seriousness, and valence.  While it is true that many expectancy violations carry a negative [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], numerous are positive and actually reduce uncertainty because they provide additional information within the parameters of the particular relationship, context, and communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships|last = Afifi|first = Walid|date = 1998|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407598153004|pmid = |first2 = Sandra|last2 = Metts|volume = 15|issue = 3 |pages=365–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''A First Look at Communication'' ====
Emory Griffin, the author of ''A First Look at Communication Theory'', analyzed unpredictability in expectancy violations theory.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; His test consisted in analyzing his interaction with four students who made various requests from him. The students were given the pseudonyms Andre, Belinda, Charlie and Dawn. They start with the letters A, B, C and D to represent the increasing distance between them and Griffin when making their requests.

[[File:Expectancy Violations in a Classroom Setting.jpg|thumb|
Adapted from Griffin's diagram in the book A first look at communication theory.
]]

Andre needed the author's endorsement for a graduate scholarship, and spoke to him from an intimate eyeball-to-eyeball distance. According to Burgoon's early model, Andre made a mistake when he crossed Griffin's ''threat threshold''; the physical and psychological discomfort the lecturer might feel could have hurt his cause. However, later that day Griffin wrote the letter of recommendation.

Belinda needed help with a term paper for a class with another professor, and asked for it from a 2-foot distance. Just as Burgoon predicted, the narrow gap between Belinda and Griffin determined him to focus his attention on their rocky relationship, and her request was declined.

Charlie invited his lecturer to play water polo with other students, and he made the invitation from the right distance of 7 feet, just outside the range of interaction Griffin anticipated. However, his invitation was declined.

Dawn launched an invitation to Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from across the room. According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from across the room would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.

Griffin's attempt to apply Burgoon's original model to conversational distance between him and his students didn't meet with much success. The theoretical scoreboard read:
: Nonverbal expectancy violations model: '''1'''
: Unpredicted random behavior: '''3'''

However, when Grifffin applied the revised EVT standards on his responses to "the proxemic violations of Andre, Belinda, Charlie, and Dawn," the scorecard "shows four hits and no misses."&lt;ref&gt;A First Look at Communication Theory, 9th edition, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

Because EVT is [[Social psychology|sociopsychological]] in nature and focuses on social codes in both [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal communication]], it is closely related to communication theories such as [[cognitive dissonance]] and [[uncertainty reduction theory]]. Recently, this theory has undergone some reconstitution by Burgoon and her colleagues and has resulted in a newly proposed theory known as [[Interpersonal adaptation theory|interaction adaptation theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/52575_Gamble_%28IC%29_Chapter_1.pdf|title=Interpersonal Communication: Building Connections Together|last1=Gamble|first1=Teri Susan Kwal|last2=Gamble|first2=Michael W.|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452220130|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more comprehensive explanation of adaptation in interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;

As mentioned above, EVT has strong roots in [[uncertainty reduction theory]].  The relationship between violation behavior and the level of uncertainty is under study.  Research indicates that violations differ in their impact on uncertainty. To be more specific, incongruent negative violations heightened uncertainty, whereas congruent violations (both positive and negative) caused declines in uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00756.x|title=The impact of violations on uncertainty and the consequences for attractiveness|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=203–233|year=2000|last1=Afifi|first1=WA|last2=Burgoon|first2=JK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also borrows from social exchange theory in that people seek reward out of interaction with others.

Two other theories share similar outlooks to EVT – Discrepancy-Arousal Theory and Patterson's [[Social facilitation|social facilitation model]] (SFM).  Like EVT, DAT explains that a receiver becomes aroused when a communicative behavior does not match the receiver's expectations.  In DAT, these differences are called discrepancies instead of expectancy violations. [[Cognitive dissonance]] and EVT both try to explain why and how people react to unexpected information and adjust themselves during communication process.

The social facilitation model has a similar outlook and labels these differences as unstable changes.  A key difference between the theories lies in the receiver's arousal level.  Both DAT and SFM maintain that the receiver experiences a physiological response whereas EVT focuses on the attention shift of the receiver.  EVT posits that expectancy violations occur frequently and are not always as serious as perceived through the lenses of other theories.

[[Anxiety/uncertainty management|Anxiety/uncertainty management theory]] is the uncertainty and Anxiety people have towards each other, relating to EVT this anxiety and uncertainty can differ between cultures. Causing a violation for example violating someones personal distance or communicating ineffectively can cause uncertainty and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;

The popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as means of conducting task-oriented and socially oriented interactions is a part of the [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) theory. Coined by Joseph Walther, the theory explores CMC's ability to fulfill many of the same functions as the more traditional forms of interaction, especially face-to-face (FtF) interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interpersonal Effects in Computer-Mediated Interaction A Relational Perspective|url = http://crx.sagepub.com/content/19/1/52|journal = Communication Research|date = 1992-02-01|issn = 0093-6502|pages = 52–90|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/009365092019001003|first = Joseph B.|last = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cues Filtered Out, Cues Filtered In: Computer-Mediated Communication and Relationships|last = Walther|first = J.B.|date = 2002|journal = Handbook of Interpersonal Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Sage|edition = 3rd|pages = 529–563|location = Thousand Oaks, California|editor-last = Knapp|editor-first = M.L.|editor2-last = Daly|editor2-first = J.A.|last2 = Parks|first2 = M.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SIP can be used in conjunction with EVT to examine interpersonal and hyperpersonal relationships established through CMC.

== Further use and development of the theory ==

The concept of [[social norms marketing]] follows expectancy violation in that it is based upon the notion that messages containing facts that vary from perception of the norm will create a positive expectancy violation.  Advertising, strategic communications, and public relations base social norms campaigns on this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campo | first1 = S. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Brossard | first3 = D. | last4 = Frazer | first4 = M.

Interaction adaptation theory further explores expectancy violations.  Developed by [[Judee K. Burgoon|Burgoon]] to take a more comprehensive look at social interaction, IAT posits that people enter into interactions with requirements, expectations, and desires.  These factors influence both the initial behavior as well as the response behavior.  When faced with behavior that meets an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive.  When faced with behavior that does not meet an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, K. &amp; Ray, G.

Conference Papers -- International Communication Association Annual Meeting, 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgoon | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Le Poire | first2 = B.

Expectancies exert significant influence on people's interaction patterns, on their impressions of one another, and on the outcomes of their interactions. People who can assume that they are well regarded by their audience are safer engaging in violations and more likely to profit from doing so than are those who are poorly regarded.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K. |author2=D. A. Coker |author3=R. A. Coker|title=Communicative Effects of Gaze Behavior|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=495–524|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1986.tb00089.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the violation act is one that is likely to be ambiguous in its meaning or to carry multiple interpretations that are not uniformly positive or negative, then the reward valence of the communicator can be especially significant in moderating interpretations, evaluations, and subsequent outcomes.

EVT also applies to international experience in the workplace. “A foreign newcomer who has the necessary education, work experience, and international experience will be perceived as having the ability to make valuable contribution to the group’s task. Consequently, education, work experience and international experience will influence a foreign newcomer’s initial task-based group acceptance (Joardar, 2011). It can be argued that a person with significant international experience will be perceived as having had the opportunity to learn how to build valuable relationships in a cross-cultural setting. Hence, international experience will have effects on initial relationship-based group acceptance as well. Meaning, this will make for a more positive expectancy violation, in the workplace especially. 
EVT is also used as a framework to analyze the negative impact of mind reading expectations on romantic relationships. In 2015, Wright and Roloff explained the idea of mind reading expectations (MRE) that romantic partners should clearly know about each other's feelings even though they are not being informed. When relational partners have done something wrong without [[self-consciousness]], people's expectations are violated. Particularly those who hold high value of MRE are more likely to become distressful once their relational partners are unaware of their violations to expectations. The study asserted that such kinds of violations related to MRE result in responses such as combative attitude and silent treatment, which is harmful to long-term romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Courtney N.|last2=Roloff|first2=Michael E.|date=2015-01-02|title=You Should Just Know Why I'm Upset: Expectancy Violation Theory and the Influence of Mind Reading Expectations (MRE) on Responses to Relational Problems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2014.989969|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=1|pages=10–19|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.989969|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''four field approach''' in [[anthropology]] sees the discipline as composed of the four subfields of [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Physical Anthropology]] and [[Cultural anthropology]]. The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by [[Franz Boas]] who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. N. (2003), Four-Field Anthropology. Anthropology News, 44: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe. 1998. Humans:  An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology. Psychology Press, 1998 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=Four Field Anthropology: Charter Myths and Time Warps from St. Louis to Oxford|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2013|volume=54|issue=6|pages=753|jstor=10.1086/673385|doi=10.1086/673385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, [[anatomy]] and population history, customs and social organization, [[folklore]], grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]] came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Borofsky, R. (2002), The Four Subfields: Anthropologists as Mythmakers. American Anthropologist, 104: 463–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Gary Alfred Tomlinson''' (born December 4, 1951) is an American [[musicologist]] and the John Hay Whitney Professor of Music and Humanities at [[Yale University]]. He was formerly the Annenberg Professor in the Humanities at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/faculty/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with a Ph.D., in 1979 with thesis titled ''Rinuccini, Peri, Monteverdi, and the humanist heritage of opera''.

Tomlinson became Director of the Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musicologist and cultural theorist Tomlinson named director of Whitney Humanities Center|url=http://news.yale.edu/2012/04/23/musicologist-and-cultural-theorist-tomlinson-named-director-whitney-humanities-center|website=YaleNews|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomlinson's research has ranged across diverse fields, including the history of opera, early-modern European musical thought and practice, the musical cultures of indigenous American societies, and the philosophy of history and critical theory.  His latest research concerns music, culture, and human evolution.  Here he is concerned to reshape the relations of evolutionary theory, archaeology, and humanistic theory so as to offer a novel model of the emergence of human modernity.  The chief ingredients of his model are the niche-construction theory of biologists' extended evolutionary synthesis, a growing systematization of culture evident in the archaeological record, and an extended semiotics indebted to Charles Sanders Peirce.

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the
Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Other organizations that have previously demonstrated HTL of biomass include Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg, Germany, SCF Technologies in Copenhagen, Denmark, EPA’s Water Engineering Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and Changing World Technology Inc.

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut für Meereskunde''' (IfM, Institute of Marine Sciences) in Kiel, Germany, existed from April 1, 1937 to January 1, 2004. It was an essential element of the long history of marine sciences in Kiel. This history started with the work of [[:de:Samuel Reyher|Samuel Reyher]] published in 1697 and is today continued within the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="HW15e" /&gt;

==Early history==

Early work in physical/chemical oceanography started with Samuel Reyher, professor at the ''Christian Albrecht [University of Kiel]'' (CAU), when he published his investigation on salinity in the ice-covered Kiel Fjord in 1697.&lt;ref group="p" name="Rey97e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kor94e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mat10"&gt;Wolfgang Matthäus: “Germany and the investigation of the Baltic Sea hydrography during the 19th and early 20th century. In: “Meereswissenschaftliche Berichte”, Warnemünde 2010, 83, S. 1 - 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Other professors of Kiel University followed with work on marine topics. [[:de:Johann Nikolaus Tetens|Johann Nikolaus Tetens]] (1736-1807) studied tides of the North Sea,&lt;ref group="p" name="KortPaffen79e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="PaffenKort84e" /&gt; [[:de:Christoph Heinrich Pfaff|Christoph Heinrich Pfaff]] (1773-1852) studied hydrographic and chemical conditions in the western Baltic Sea,&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Pfaff" /&gt; and [[:de:Gustav Adolf Michaelis|Gustav Adolf Michaelis]] (1798-1848) discussed optical effects in the sea.&lt;ref name="Micha"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFcHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=gustav+adolf+michaelis+kiel+meer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iZXhwtJRfH&amp;sig=Z0SiNCZnOQ0wpXGihBSt1Suj3a4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj19oHBopLbAhVMJlAKHRoiByAQ6AEIZjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20adolf%20michaelis%20kiel%20meer&amp;f=false |title=Ueber das Leuchten der Ostsee nach eigenen Beobachtungen |accessdate=May 21, 2018 | language=German | trans-title=On the shining of the Baltic Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic marine research, however, began only later during the 19th century with biological studies, most notably by the zoologist [[:de:Karl August Möbius|Karl August Möbius]] (1825-1908), the physiologist [[Victor Hensen]] (1835-1924), the marine production biologist [[Karl Brandt]] (1854-1931), and the zoologist [[:de:Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn|Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn]] (1808-1878) who participated in the first of the Danish [[Galathea expeditions]] (1845-1847). The [[:de:Plankton-Expedition|Plankton-Expedition]] in the Atlantic Ocean on the ’’National’’ in 1889 was the beginning of deep-sea expeditions carried out by Kiel scientists.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

Systematic physical and chemical marine studies also started during the second half of the 19th century. Two people need to be acknowledged in particular. The merchant and industrialist [[:de:Heinrich Adolph Meyer|Heinrich Adolph Meyer]] (1822-1889) from Hamburg managed to  convene a group united by marine research interests. The physicist [[Gustav Karsten]] (1820-1900) from Kiel belonged to this group. A long-term cooperation developed among these two people. Beginning in 1859, Meyer carried out first hydrographic observations in Kiel Fjord and started systematic measurements for the investigation of seasonal changes in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mat10" /&gt; Meyer received his honorary doctor from Kiel University in 1866.

A major step was the establishment of the “Prussian Commission for the Scientific Investigation of German Seas in Kiel“ (also called the ''Kiel Commission''; in German: ''Preußische Kommission zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der deutschen Meere in Kiel''). Meyer was a founding member and held the first chair until 1880, with Karsten being his successor until 1896. Möbius and Hensen were also members of the commission. The main objective was the improvement of fisheries. But it became evident soon that this goal could not be reached without an improved knowledge of the hydrography and the development of new approaches and methods. Subsequently the Kiel Commission played an important role in the development of marine sciences in Gemany.&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="KoCu1902" /&gt; A "Laboratory for international marine science" (in German: "Laboratorium für die internationale Meeresforschung") was established by the Commission in 1902. Furthermore, the geographer [[Otto Krümmel]] became professor at Kiel University in 1883,&lt;ref group="p" name="Ko05e"/&gt; strengthening hydrographic work. He wrote the first textbook (2 volumes) on oceanography in German language.&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr07e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr11e" /&gt; The Institute of Zoology and [[Zoological Museum of Kiel University]] became the center of marine biological research, led by [[:de:Adolf Remane|Adolf Remane]] (1898-1976) from 1924 to 1934. In addition, Kiel was the home of outstanding scientists and engineers in marine acoustics as part of industry and navy, in particular [[Alexander Behm]] (1880-1952), Hugo Lichte (1891-1963)&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Lichte1919" /&gt; and [[:de:Karl Heinrich Hecht|Karl Heinrich Hecht]] (1880-1961).

==Institut für Meereskunde==

The University of Kiel decided to concentrate marine sciences within an institution of the university, and the ''Institut für Meereskunde'' (IfM) was founded in 1937.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ge00e" /&gt; Activities of the former laboratories of the Kiel Commission were included in the new institution. The institute had three departments: Biology, Hydrography and Chemistry, and Geology. In addition to disciplinary work, interdisciplinary approaches took root. Studies in the Baltic Sea were supposed to be in the focus, but not exclusively. A building in Kitzeberg on the eastern shore of Kiel Fjord was provided. Remane was director of the IfM from 1937 to 1944. The marine chemist [[:de:Hermann Wattenberg|Hermann Wattenberg]] (1901-1944) became his successor on May 1, 1944. He perished shortly after the appointment on July 24, 1944, together with eight other members of the institute, when bombs destroyed the institute’s building during World War II.

After the end of the war in 1945, work at the IfM already started again in 1946.&lt;ref name="KoCu1946"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22468/1/1946-1972.pdf |title=Meeresforschung in Kiel 1946-1972|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |language=German | trans-title=Marine research in Kiel 1946-1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Georg Wüst]] (1890-1977) became Professor of Oceanography and Meteorology at the CAU and Director of the IfM. He had been a scientific leader at the former Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences at Berlin University (in German: “Institut und [[:de:Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)|Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)]]“ &lt;ref group="p" name="Kor87e" /&gt; and had mostly performed research on the circulation of water masses in the global ocean and in particular in the deep Atlantic. In Kiel he succeeded in retrieving several earlier members of the institute, getting the permission to use an old villa on the western shore of Kiel as an institute’s building, obtaining the research cutter “Südfall“ and restarting educational programs.&lt;ref name="Erdk51"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25635619 | title=Der Wiederaufbau der deutschen ozeanographischen Forschung nach dem Zusammenbruch im Urteil des Auslandes | language=German | trans-title=The rebuilding of German oceanographic research after the downfall in the judgement of foreign countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; He began research work in the Baltic Sea with a total staff of 15.

After Wüst’s retirement [[Günter Dietrich]] (1911-1972) became his successor. He had been a student at the University of Berlin and had also studied the circulation of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean with Georg Wüst and [[Albert Defant]] at the former Berlin institute. Wüst’s and Dietrich’s experience in deep ocean studies strengthened the orientation of the IfM work towards the open and deep ocean, in particular in physical and chemical oceanography. The IfM became the leading marine research institution in West Germany during those years,&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kr87e"&gt;Wolfgang Krauss: ''Günter Dietrichs Kieler Jahre (1959 - 1972).''[“Günter Dietrich’s years in Kiel (1959 - 1972)“] In: '' Christiana Albertina.'' Neumünster 1987, 24 N.F. S. 43-54.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on the scientific legacy of the former Berlin institute in research&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; and education.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di57e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di75e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di80" /&gt; Technically, the successor of the earlier Museum of Marine Sciences in Berlin today is the [[German Museum of Technology]] in Berlin.

An important milestone in the IfM’s development was the commission of the new research vessel [[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1964)|Meteor (Schiff, 1964)]], operated jointly by the German Hydrographic Office (see [[Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany]]) and the German Research Foundation (see [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]. The ship was used by all interested research groups in Germany. The first major expedition 1964/65 to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean was part of the ''International Indian Ocean Expedition''.&lt;ref name="scorIIOE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iioe-2.incois.gov.in/IIOE-2/iioe.jsp |title=About International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German contribution was led by [[Günter Dietrich]] and [[:de:Eugen Seibold|Eugen Seibold]], both from Kiel University, and the majority of scientists and technicians were based in Kiel.&lt;ref group="p" name="Di66e" /&gt; This expedition was the restart of deep-sea oceanography in Kiel.

The financial needs of the IfM were increasing with its tasks and number of personnel, having increased to 124 in the year 1968.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI68e" /&gt; In order to obtain additional funding from the federal and other state governments, the IfM joined the group of “blue list” research institutions (see [[Leibniz Association]] in 1968. New statutes introduced a collegial system, with the acting director being elected for two-year terms by a panel composed of department heads and employee representatives. Although the funding was no longer related to the university budget, strong ties to the CAU prevailed. Professors were selected jointly by the IfM and the CAU.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ad92e" /&gt;

During the following years the IfM became partner in a considerable number of international research programs.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt; A relevant number of IfM scientists worked at foreign research institutions for extended time periods, primarily in the USA. Later a large number of foreign investigators joined the IfM as visiting scientists. The number of employees was increasing steadily.

In the meantime marine geology and geophysics groups had developed parallel to the IfM groups at the CAU. Parts of these activities were combined in the new geoscience institute “Geomar” established in 1987.&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt; At the end of 2001 Geomar had 153 members of staff.&lt;ref name="JBG02"&gt;“GEOMAR Jahresbericht/Annual Report 2001.” GEOMAR Forschungszentrum für marine Geowissenschaften der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel 2001, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the IfM had increased to 252 by that time.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI02" /&gt; With the aim of achieving an increasing collaboration of marine disciplines in Kiel, the “IfM” and “Geomar” joined organizationally to form “IFM-GEOMAR” as part of the “Leibniz Association” on January 1, 2004. The new institution had 389 members of staff at its beginning.&lt;ref name="JBG05"&gt;Andreas Villwock (Ed.): “IFM-GEOMAR Report 2002-2004.” Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften, Kiel 2005, A-2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fiscal considerations, IFM-GEOMAR was transferred to an institution of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] on January 1, 2004, thus being primarily funded by the federal government. The name changed to [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].

The '''Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics''' ('''IAA''') in [[Brussels]] is a part of the physics department of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]. It is an international center of excellence in the field of [[nuclear astrophysics]]. The institute's director is currently Prof. Alain Jorissen. The institute is composed of one full professor, five tenured [[NFWO|FNRS]] senior researchers, nine postdoctoral fellows from various countries ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Slovakia]]), and three Ph.D. students (Belgium, [[Italy]]).

==Field of research==
Its research interests involve nuclear astrophysics, [[stellar evolution]], [[chemical composition]] of [[star]]s, [[binary star]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[modified Newtonian dynamics]].

==Achievements==
The institute has been a leading [[laboratory]] in many national and international collaborations. One of these collaborations has led to a world premiere, the direct measurement of a [[nuclear reaction]] rate on an unstable target at energies of interest in [[astrophysics]] &lt;ref&gt;

'''Issue advocacy ads''' (also known as '''interest advocacy ads''' or '''issue only ads''') are communications intended to bring awareness to a certain problem.  Groups that sponsor this form of communication are known by several names including: [[Advocacy group|interest advocacy group, issue advocacy group, issue only group, or special interest group]].  The problems these groups raise awareness of can be either a social or political issue.

==Interest versus express advocacy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The bright-line test doesn't cover forms of communication that are indirect or debatable.  Consider this message to voters:

*''If you like candidate X, you need to know he did Y.''

In a communication like this, there is no mention about voting, however, the plain intention is to cast doubt on voters that supported candidate X.  

Campaigning like this is typically called [[negative campaigning]], making attack ads, or making thinly veiled promotional ads on the behalf of the candidate.

===Interest advocacy===
Interest advocacy is the act of making generalized communication regarding a public issue or problem without advocating voters to take a specific action at the election booth.&lt;ref name="moritz"&gt;[http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part3/campaign_finance_fed_glossary.html by Michelle Robinson, Section 3.1 - Campaign finance, Subsection 3.1.1 Federal law, Glossary of term, Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of a pure "issue only ads" made by interest advocacy groups is difficult.  Groups that sponsored messages needed to make it clear, to a voter with [[reasonable person|reasonable intelligence]], that the voter should cast their ballot in a manner the group wanted.

Keeping an advertisement issue important to only groups like [[501(c)(3)]] non-profits. They were subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. Organizations can participate in nonpartisan voter education efforts, including registration and "get-out-the-vote" drives and issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="Elacqua"&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on 501(c)(3) organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, p. 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Express advocacy===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Express advocacy is largely used in connection with a debate in the US regarding when issue advocacy turns into [[political campaign|campaigning]]. 

Many groups that made what appeared to most to be campaign advertisements claimed that their communications to voters were really issue advocacy and not express advocacy. To help understand the difference, examine these two communications to voters: 

*''Select John Smith.''
*''Vote no! on Proposition 99.''

In both examples the message's intention is clear. Using a standard that looks for specific words or phrases in a communication is called conducting a [[bright-line]] test. Bright-line is a standard if there is no mistake.  One or more of the "[[Eight Magic Words]]" or their {{clarify|reason=definition?|text=equivalents|date=March 2016}} is present or not present.  

Express advocacy is associated with [[independent expenditure]]s.

===History===
In the 1970s, changes to regulations permitted non-candidate organizations to make [[independent expenditure]]s and use their money in election season. They could neither give it directly to a candidate nor make advertisement on a candidates behalf.  Typical expenditures were described as being "party building" and [[get out the vote]] campaigns. Organizations, especially non-profits were supposed to do it on a [[nonpartisan]] basis. However, groups tended to focus efforts on signing up and getting the type of voters to the polls that were most likely to hold similar views.

The only barrier stopping a group from campaigning directly for their favorite candidate or cause was something called the "reasonable person" test: if a reasonable person, viewing the communication, comes to the conclusion the sponsor wants them to vote in one way, it is express advocacy, not interest advocacy.&lt;ref name="BlueRibbon"&gt;[http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm Governor’s Blue-Ribbon Commission on campaign finance reform for State of Wisconsin, Final Report, Section 5. Level the playing field, Promoting freedom of speech, paragraph 3-6, Chairman Donald F. Kettl, May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209063419/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One problem with the reasonable person test is it is not definitive or a [[bright-line rule]].  There was no clear line that clearly stated if you cross this point you are on the wrong side. In an attempt to help the situation, in 1976 a footnote was included in a US Supreme Court ruling provided eight examples.&lt;ref name="BuckleyValeo"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Buckley v. Valeo |last=Smith |first=Craig R. |title=Free Speech on Trial: Communication Perspectives on Landmark Supreme Court Decisions |editor=Parker, Richard A. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-1301-X |pages=203&amp;ndash;217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, rather than using them as examples, many found it easier to just leave out the "magic words" and claim their communications to voters were fine. By 1996, interest advocacy groups were spending millions of dollars on campaigns claiming their advertisements were "issue only" since they left out the "magic words."

By 2000, voters were inundated with $500 million worth of this type of advertisement.&lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~smpa/faculty/documents/Swift_Boat_Article_FALR_000.pdf Swift boat Vets in 2004: Press coverage of an independent campaign, First Amendment Law Review, University of North Carolina School of Law, Vol. 4, 2005, by Albert L. May, July 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the "shame issue ads," scandals, and the amount of spending, Congress held a congressional investigation.  It reinvigorated campaign finance reform, and led to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002, which is more commonly known as McCain-Feingold.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|75}}

In 2003, in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', the Court detailed the difference between interest versus express advocacy. It ruled looking for [[Eight Magic Words|"magic words"]] as "functionally meaningless" since an advertiser can communicate its intention to voters without them.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|15}} Therefore, instead of looking for words, the Court again ruled that if a communication to voters had  "no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for, or against, a specific candidate," it is "the functional equivalent of express advocacy."&lt;ref name="GSUlaw"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1878727 Has the tide turned in favor of disclosure? Revealing money in politics after Citizens United and Doe v. Reed, by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Georgia State University Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2011, July 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1092}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], "issue only" ads continued and some famous ones were made by a group called [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat]].  They claimed their advertisements were issue only ads, not express advocacy. According to at least one analyst, voters voted exactly how the sponsors intended and the advertisements "torpedoed" [[Massachusetts]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/wyly-brothers-republican-campaign-donations_n_664550.html "Wyly Brothers Gave Millions To Over 200 Republican Candidates"], ''The Huffington Post'', Marcus Baram, July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[political action committee]] [[Progress of America]], ran an advertisement that showed the horrors of terrorism and stated that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] want to kill American citizens. At the end, ot asked, "Would you trust Kerry against these killers?" "George Bush did not start this War, but he will end it." The "magic words" are missing.  

In 2007, the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' ruled that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. The test to tell the difference between interest and express advocacy remained the [[reasonable person]] test.

However, that is said to have created a difficulty. A test that requires someone to consider how a [[reasonable person]] views a communication to voters requires someone to decide. The only definitive answer comes from a judge and that takes time. Election commissions are not judges, but they can issue [[advisory opinion]] on the matter. That led to a concern that in federal elections, that officials at the [[Federal Election Commission]] and state-level commissions would have to do work. Anyone cautious, wanting to make sure the communication to voters, was interest and not express advocacy would contact it for an opinion.  Communications to voters covers a wide range of areas including advertisements, e-mails, signs, and even speeches on the pulpit might want to ask someone.  

To resolve this issue, the [[US Supreme Court]] looked back at a prior ruling. In 1976, in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', the Supreme Court held that one thing of key importance was protecting free speech. 

In 2010, ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''  determined, among other things, that it would be basically not possible for the federal government to be in the business of determining what does and does not constitute issue advocacy or express advocacy.

==Disclosure requirements==
In 2010, ''Citizens United'' "expressly rejected the contention that election-law disclosure requirements are limited to express
advocacy or its functional equivalent." While it and a subsequent case affected certain spending limitations, it did not permit those making the spending from evading disclosure requirements by claiming they were performing issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1091-1092}}

Also in 2010 in a case known as ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to keep signatures upon a referendum from voters, based upon a claim it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Lower courts are already applying these new standards to uphold a gamut of state disclosure laws ranging from ballot measures to candidate elections, and from express advocacy to issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1103}}

'''Legal archaeology''' is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." &lt;ref name = &gt;Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, and Harry G. Prince, ''Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials: Fifth Edition'', pp. 749-50, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided. These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." &lt;ref name = Vogel&gt;Joan Vogel, ''Cases in Context: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification, and Ploof v. Putnam'', 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 791, 792.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal archaeologist might also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information might show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or if one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case. &lt;ref name = Maute&gt;Judith Maute, ''Response: The Values of Legal Archaeology'', 2000 Utah L. Rev. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''[[Baudhayana]] [[Sulba Sutras|Sulba Sutra]]''====

* [[Baudhayana]] (8th century BC)
Believed to have been written around the 8th century BC, this is one of the oldest mathematical texts. It laid the foundations of [[Indian mathematics]] and was influential in [[South Asia]] and its surrounding regions, and [[Indian mathematics#Charges of Eurocentrism|perhaps even Greece]]. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, geometric solutions of linear equations, the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c and ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s with up to four unknowns.

====''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''====

* ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' from the 10th–2nd century BCE.
Contains the earliest description of [[Gaussian elimination]] for solving
system of linear equations, it also contains method for finding square root and cubic root.

===''Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]
'''Publication data:''' ''Annals of Mathematics'', 1955

''FAC'', as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of [[complex manifold]]s.  Serre introduced [[Čech cohomology]] of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry.  For example, the [[long exact sequence]] in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group.  The dimension of a vector space of sections of a [[coherent sheaf]] is finite, in [[projective geometry]], and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example [[Hodge number]]s.  While Grothendieck's [[derived functor]] cohomology has replaced Čech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by Čech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important.

===''[[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry|Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique]]''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1956)
In [[mathematics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[analytic geometry]] are closely related subjects, where ''analytic geometry'' is the theory of [[complex manifold]]s and the more general [[analytic geometry|analytic space]]s defined locally by the vanishing of [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]]. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from [[Hodge theory]]. (''NB'' While [[analytic geometry]] as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was ''Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique'' by [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], now usually referred to as ''GAGA''. A ''GAGA-style result'' would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

Written with the assistance of [[Jean Dieudonné]], this is [[Grothendieck]]'s exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry.  It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry.  The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] et al.
These seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at [[IHÉS]] starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960–1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the last of the open [[Weil conjectures]] in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Michael Artin]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]], [[Pierre Deligne]], and [[Nicholas Katz]].

In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as [[Fermat]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and adds many important new results of his own.  Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], the first two published proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], a deep investigation of binary [[quadratic forms]] going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithmétique, a first appearance of [[Gauss sums]], [[cyclotomy#Cyclotomic fields|cyclotomy]], and the theory of [[constructible polygon]]s with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular [[Heptadecagon|17-gon]].  Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of [[Class number (number theory)|class numbers]] of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had [[Class number problem|conjectured]].&lt;ref name=irelandrosen&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Ireland | first1 = K. |last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | title = A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1993  | location = New York, New York  | pages = 358–361  | isbn = 0-387-97329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves#Hasse-Weil Bound|Hasse–Weil theorem]]).&lt;ref name=silvermantate&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Silverman | first1 = J. |last2 = Tate | first2 = J. | title = Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1992 | location = New York, New York  | isbn = 0-387-97825-9  | page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern [[analytic number theory]].  It also contains the famous [[Riemann Hypothesis]], one of the most important open problems in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Edwards (mathematician)|H. M.

The ''Vorlesungen'' can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of [[Fermat]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and the modern number theory of Dedekind, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]].

Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]] (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the [[Tate conjecture]] (relating the [[homomorphism]]s between two [[abelian varieties]] over a [[number field]] to the homomorphisms between their [[Tate module]]s) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.

The proof's method of identification of a [[deformation ring]] with a [[Hecke operator|Hecke algebra]] (now referred to as an ''R=T'' theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.

Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of [[Newton's laws of motion]] forming the foundation of [[classical mechanics]] as well as his [[Gravity|law of universal gravitation]], and derives [[laws of Kepler|Kepler's laws]] for the motion of the [[planet]]s (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena.  In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus.  When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{Cite web| last = Gray | first = Jeremy| title=MAA Book Review: Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton's Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736 by Niccolò Guicciardini|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/readnewton.html| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced [[Fourier analysis]], specifically [[Fourier series]]. Key contribution was to not simply use [[trigonometric series]], but to model ''all'' functions by trigonometric series.
{{cquote|&lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)=a\cos\frac{\pi y}{2}+a'\cos 3\frac{\pi y}{2}+a''\cos5\frac{\pi y}{2}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and then integrating from &lt;math&gt;y=-1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y=+1&lt;/math&gt; yields:

&lt;math&gt;a_i=\int_{-1}^1\varphi(y)\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;}}
When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Laplace]], [[Étienne-Louis Malus|Malus]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], among others) concluded: ''...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...]  his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour''. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the [[Dirichlet integral]] and later the [[Lebesgue integral]].

In this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of [[cobordism#Oriented cobordism|oriented]] and [[List of cohomology theories#Unoriented cobordism|unoriented cobordism]], and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain [[Thom space]]s.  Thom completely characterized the unoriented cobordism ring and achieved strong results for several problems, including [[Steenrod problem|Steenrod's problem]] on the realization of cycles.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné556"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dieudonné | first = Jean | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 556–575 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sullivan  | first = Dennis  |date=April 2004 | title = René Thom's Work On Geometric Homology And Bordism | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 41  | issue = 3  | pages = 341–350  | url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2004-41-03/S0273-0979-04-01026-2/S0273-0979-04-01026-2.pdf | format = PDF  | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-04-01026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Category theory]]==

==="General Theory of Natural Equivalences"===

* [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1945)
The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in ''Categories for the Working Mathematician'' that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, "natural" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, "natural" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.

===''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1971, second edition 1998)
Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses.  Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as [[adjoint functor]]s and [[universal properties]].

===''[[Higher Topos Theory]]''===
* [[Jacob Lurie]] (2010)
''This purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of "quasicategories" or "weak Kan complexes"), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included.'' (see arXiv.)

==[[Set theory]]==

==="Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen"===

* [[Georg Cantor]] (1874)
'''Online version:''' [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002155583 Online version]

Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article]].)

===''[[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]]''===

* [[Felix Hausdorff]]
First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on [[measure theory]] and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.

==="The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory"===

* [[Kurt Gödel]] (1938)
Gödel proves the results of the title.  Also, in the process, introduces the [[constructible universe|class L of constructible sets]], a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.

==="The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis"===

* [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul J. Cohen]] (1963, 1964)
Cohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and axiom of choice with respect to [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].  In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]'' which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.

==[[Logic]]==

===''[[The Laws of Thought]]''===

* [[George Boole]] (1854)
Published in 1854, [[The Laws of Thought]] was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re-expression and extension of Aristotle's logic in the language of mathematics. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for [[Claude Shannon]] in the development of digital logic.

===''[[Begriffsschrift]]''===

* [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879)
Published in 1879, the title '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as "''a [[formula]] [[language]], modelled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]]''". Frege's motivation for developing his [[formal logical system]] was similar to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s desire for a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein.  It was arguably the most significant publication in [[logic]] since [[Aristotle]].

===''[[Formulario mathematico]]''===

* [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1895)
First published in 1895, the '''Formulario mathematico''' was the first mathematical book written entirely in a [[formal language|formalized language]]. It contained a description of [[mathematical logic]] and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.

===''[[Principia Mathematica]]''===

* [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1910–1913)
The '''''Principia Mathematica''''' is a three-volume work on the foundations of [[mathematics]], written by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published in 1910–1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] in 1931.

===''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]''===

* [[Alan Turing]]'s Ph.D. thesis

==="Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I"===

([[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]])
*  [[Kurt Gödel]] (1931)
'''Online version:''' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p03501kn35215860/ Online version]

In [[mathematical logic]], '''[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]''' are two celebrated theorems proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931.
The first incompleteness theorem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For any formal system such that (1) it is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistent ([[omega-consistent]]), (2) it has a [[recursively definable]] set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of derivation]], and (3) every [[computable function#Computable sets and relations|recursive]] relation of natural numbers is definable in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural numbers and yet it is not a [[theorem]] of the system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==[[Combinatorics]]==

==="On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression"===

*[[Endre Szemerédi]] (1975)
Settled a conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]] (now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  Szemerédi's solution has been described as a "masterpiece of combinatorics"&lt;ref name=Steele2008&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2008 | title = 2008 Steele Prizes; Seminal Contribution to Research: Endre Szemerédi  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 55  | issue = 4  | page = 488  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200804/tx080400486p.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]].&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2013 | title = Interview with Endre Szemerédi  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 60  | issue = 2  | page = 226  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 27 January 2013 | doi=10.1090/noti948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Graph theory]]===

====''Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis''====

* [[Leonhard Euler]] (1741)
* [http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E053.pdf Euler's original publication] (in Latin)
Euler's solution of the [[Königsberg bridge problem]] in ''Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis'' (''The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position'') is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]].

===="On the evolution of random graphs"====

*[[Paul Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi]] (1960)
Provides a detailed discussion of sparse [[random graphs]], including distribution of components, occurrence of small subgraphs, and phase transitions.&lt;ref name="Bollobás"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bollobás | first = Béla | title = Modern Graph Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2002 | page = 252 | isbn = 978-0-387-98488-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[L. R. Ford, Jr.|Ford, L.]], &amp; [[D. R. Fulkerson|Fulkerson, D.]]
* ''Flows in Networks''. Prentice-Hall, 1962.
Presents the [[Ford-Fulkerson algorithm]] for solving the [[maximum flow problem]], along with many ideas on flow-based models.

==[[Computational complexity theory]]==
''See [[List of important publications in theoretical computer science#Computational complexity theory|List of important publications in theoretical computer science]].''

==Probability theory and statistics==
''See [[list of important publications in statistics]].''

==[[Game theory]]==

==="Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele"===

* [[John von Neumann]] (1928)
Went well beyond [[Émile Borel]]'s initial investigations into strategic two-person game theory by proving the [[minimax theorem]] for two-person, zero-sum games.

===''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]''===

* [[Oskar Morgenstern]], [[John von Neumann]] (1944)
This book led to the investigation of modern game theory as a prominent branch of mathematics. This work contained the method for finding optimal solutions for two-person zero-sum games.

==="Equilibrium Points in N-person Games"===

* {{cite journal | mr = 0031701 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/48 | title = Equilibrium Points in N-person Games | doi = 10.1073/pnas.36.1.48 | pmid=16588946 | pmc=1063129 | volume=36 | date=January 1950 | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=48–9 | last1 = Nash | first1 = JF}}
[[Nash equilibrium]]

===''[[On Numbers and Games]]''===

*[[John Horton Conway]]
The book is in two, {0,1&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games – both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as [[Nim]], [[Hackenbush]], [[map-coloring games#Col and Snort|Col and Snort]] amongst the  many described.

===''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''===

*[[Elwyn Berlekamp]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]
A compendium of information on [[mathematical games]].  It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on [[Combinatorial game theory]] and [[surreal numbers]], and the other concentrating on a number of specific games.

==[[Fractal]]s==

===''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]''===

*[[Benoît Mandelbrot]]
A discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975.
Shows Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.

==[[Numerical analysis]]==

===[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]]===

====''Method of Fluxions''====

* [[Isaac Newton]]
''[[Method of Fluxions]]'' was a book written by [[Isaac Newton]]. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736.  Within this book, Newton describes a method (the [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]]) for finding the real zeroes of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

====''Essai d'une nouvelle méthode pour déterminer les maxima et les minima des formules intégrales indéfinies''====

* [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (1761)
Major early work on the [[calculus of variations]], building upon some of Lagrange's prior investigations as well as those of [[Euler]].  Contains investigations of minimal surface determination as well as the initial appearance of [[Lagrange multipliers]].

===="Математические методы организации и планирования производства"====

* [[Leonid Kantorovich]] (1939) "[The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization]" (in Russian).
Kantorovich wrote the first paper on production planning, which used Linear Programs as the model. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 1975.

===="Decomposition Principle for Linear Programs"====

* [[George Dantzig]] and P. Wolfe
* Operations Research 8:101–111, 1960.
Dantzig's is considered the father of [[linear programming]] in the western world. He independently invented the [[simplex algorithm]]. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large-scale linear programs in factory and production planning.

===="How Good is the Simplex Algorithm?"====

* [[Victor Klee]] and George J. Minty
* {{cite book|title=Inequalities&amp;nbsp;III (Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Inequalities held at the University of California, Los Angeles, Calif., September&amp;nbsp;1–9,&amp;nbsp;1969, dedicated to the memory of Theodore&amp;nbsp;S.

Minty|chapter=How good is the simplex algorithm?|pages=159–175|ref=harv}}
Klee and Minty gave an example showing that the [[simplex algorithm]] can take exponentially many steps to solve a [[linear program]].

===="Полиномиальный алгоритм в линейном программировании"====

* {{Cite journal| last=Khachiyan | first=Leonid Genrikhovich | authorlink=Leonid Khachiyan | year=1979 | script-title=ru:Полиномиальный алгоритм в линейном программировании |trans-title=A polynomial algorithm for linear programming | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=244 | pages=1093–1096 | language=Russian}}.
Khachiyan's work on the ellipsoid method. This was the first polynomial time algorithm for linear programming.

==Early manuscripts==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of mathematics]] --&gt;
{{Globalize|date=November 2009}}
These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the [[history of mathematics]].

===''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]''===

* [[Ahmes]] ([[scribe]])

One of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the [[Second Intermediate Period]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was copied by the scribe [[Ahmes]] (properly ''Ahmose'') from an older [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] [[papyrus]]. It laid the foundations of [[Egyptian mathematics]] and in turn, later influenced [[Greek mathematics|Greek and Hellenistic mathematics]]. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of π only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at [[squaring the circle]] and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the [[Egyptians]] deliberately built their [[pyramid]]s to enshrine the value of π in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the [[cotangent]].

===''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''===

*[[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]
Although the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school [[geometry]], he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using [[infinitesimal]]s to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus.  Among those problems were that of the [[center of gravity]] of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a [[parabola]] and one of its secant lines.  For explicit details of the method used, see [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals]].

===''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''===

*[[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]

'''Online version:''' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045847/http://web.fccj.org/~ethall/archmede/sandreck.htm Online version]

The first known (European) [[numeral system|system of number-naming]] that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life.

==Textbooks==

===''[[Synopsis of Pure Mathematics]]''===

* [[G. S. Carr]]
Contains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training his students for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Studied extensively by [[Ramanujan]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FTgAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=george+shoobridge+carr#PPR7,M1 (first half here)]

===''[[Éléments de mathématique]]''===

* [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]
One of the most influential books in French mathematical literature. It introduces some of the notations and definitions that are now usual (the symbol ∅ or the term bijective for example). Characterized by an extreme level of rigour, formalism and generality (up to the point of being highly criticized for that), its publication started in 1939 and is still unfinished today.

===''[[Arithmetick: or, The Grounde of Arts]]''===

* [[Robert Recorde]]
Written in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language.

===''[[Cocker's Arithmetick]]''===

* [[Edward Cocker]] (authorship disputed)
Textbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676.  This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years.

===''[[The Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical]]''===

* [[Thomas Dilworth]]
An early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in [[United States of America|America]] in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections.

===''Geometry''===

*[[Andrei Petrovich Kiselyov|Andrei Kiselyov]]
'''Publication data:''' 1892

The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and [http://www.maa.org/reviews/KiselevGeomI.html MAA review].)

===''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]]

A classic textbook in introductory [[mathematical analysis]], written by [[G. H. Hardy]]. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the [[University of Cambridge]], and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge.  As such, it was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students — the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory [[calculus]] and the theory of [[infinite series]].

===''[[Moderne Algebra]]''===

* [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]]
The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether.  First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag.  A later English translation was published in 1949 by [[Frederick Ungar Publishing Company]].

===''[[Algebra (book)|Algebra]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Garrett Birkhoff]]
A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a [[Category theory|category theoretic]] approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.

===''Calculus, Vol. 1''===

* [[Tom M. Apostol]]

===''[[Algebraic Geometry (book)|Algebraic Geometry]]''===

* [[Robin Hartshorne]]
The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology.  Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the [[hom functor|functor of points]].

===''[[Naive Set Theory (book)|Naive Set Theory]]''===

* [[Paul Halmos]]
An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a "true" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like [[large cardinal]]s.  Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

===''[[Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers]]''===

* [[Wacław Sierpiński]]
The ''nec plus ultra'' reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.

===''[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]''===

* [[Kenneth Kunen]]
This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, ''Set Theory''. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom.

===''Topologie''===

* [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov]]
* [[Heinz Hopf]]
First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering "reference" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.

===''General Topology''===

* [[John L. Kelley]]
First published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.

===''Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint''===

* [[John Milnor]]
This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style.  While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.

===''[[Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre]]''===

* [[André Weil]]
An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field.  The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.  The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.

===''An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright]]
''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.

===''[[Foundations of Differential Geometry]]''===

*[[Shoshichi Kobayashi]] and [[Katsumi Nomizu]]

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I''===

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II''===

* [[Claire Voisin]]

==Popular writings==

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===

* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]
''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]: an Eternal Golden Braid'' is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.
It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: "I realized that to me, Gödel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book."

===''The World of Mathematics''===

*  [[James R. Newman]]
''[[The World of Mathematics]]'' was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincaré, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry''' ('''[[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] Institute''') in [[Göttingen]] is a research institute of the [[Max Planck Society]]. Currently, 850 people work at the institute, about half of them are scientists.

The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is the only one of the institutes within the Max Planck Society which combines the three classical scientific disciplines – [[biology]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Founded in 1971, its initial focus was set on physical and chemical problems. It has since undergone a continuous evolution manifested by an expanding range of core subjects and work areas such as [[neurobiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

== History ==
[[Image:MPI-BPC-Göttingen 05.2006.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial picture of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen (Picture: Jörg Winkler, 2007)]] The history of the Institute goes back to the year 1949. At that time, the Max Planck Society established the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in Göttingen as follow-up of the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, who already worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, became the founding director of the new institute. He was one of the first researchers who applied physical-chemical methods in biological research and thus combined different disciplines of natural sciences in research.

The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was created in 1971 by merging the Max Planck Institutes for Physical Chemistry and for Spectroscopy in Göttingen. This was mainly initiated by Nobel Prize laureate [[Manfred Eigen]], who was at that time director of the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. His vision of an interdisciplinary approach to biological research was decisive and the creative impulse for the development of the institute. In honour of Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, the new institute was named after him.

Although the institute is dedicated to basic research – by virtue of the charter of the Max Planck Society – its policy has been to encourage the transfer of numerous technological innovations to the marketplace. As a consequence, many licensing agreements and start-up firms have arisen from research conducted at the institute, e. g. [[Lambda Physik]] (today part of Coherent), [[DeveloGen]] (today part of [[Evotec]]) and [[Evotec]].

== Research ==

=== Research Focus ===
Research at the institute focuses on the fundamental mechanisms that regulate and control life processes: How is genetic information correctly translated into proteins? How do nerve cells communicate with each other? How is cellular logistics controlled? On the organismal level, researchers at the Institute study the circadian rhythms of the vertebrate, or differentiation and development in multicellular organisms.

To obtain even deeper insights into the nanocosmos of living cells, the institute employs ultra-high resolution microscopy, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] and tomography, [[mass spectrometry]], [[optical spectroscopy]], or atomistic computer simulations. At the same time the Institute concentrates on developing novel measurement and analysis methods to provide a closer look into the world of molecules.

=== Departments ===
The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry currently encompasses 12 departments:

* '''Prof. Patrick Cramer''' - ''Molecular Biology''
* '''Prof. Gregor Eichele''' - ''Genes and Behavior''
* '''Prof. Dirk Görlich''' - ''Cellular Logistics''
* '''Prof. Christian Griesinger''' - ''NMR-based Structural Biology''
* '''Prof. Helmut Grubmüller''' - ''Theoretical and Computational Biophysics''
* '''Prof. [[Peter Gruss]]''' - ''Molecular Cell Biology''
* '''Prof. [[Stefan Hell|Stefan W. Hell]]''' - ''NanoBiophotonics''
* '''Prof. Herbert Jäckle''' - ''Molecular Developmental Biology''
* '''Prof. Reinhard Jahn''' - ''Neurobiology''
* '''Prof. Reinhard Lührmann''' - ''Cellular Biochemistry''
* '''Prof. Marina Rodnina''' - ''Physical Biochemistry''
* '''Prof. Alec M. Wodtke''' - ''Dynamics at Surfaces''

=== Research Groups ===
The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is particularly engaged in the support of junior scientists. 31 independent research groups pursue their own research goals.

=== Emeritus Groups ===
After retiring, directors of the Institute can actively continue their research for a couple of years.

* '''Prof. Thomas Jovin''' - ''Laboratory for Cellular Dynamics''
* '''Prof. [[Erwin Neher]]''' - ''Membrane Biophysics''
* '''Prof. Jürgen Troe''' - ''Spectroscopy and Photochemical Kinetics''

=== Former Departments ===
The Institute has undergone a permanent change in research with the closing of departments after their heads have retired and by continuously establishing new departments. Some of the former directors pursue their research even after their Emeritus Group has expired and can still be contacted at the institute (*).

=== Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH ===
The institute also accommodates the independent [http://www.biomednmr.mpg.de Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH] headed by [[Jens Frahm]], which was founded in 1993. The focus of this association is the development and application of spatially resolved NMR techniques for non-invasive studies of the central nervous system in animals and humans. These innovative approaches allow for unique insights into the structure, metabolism and function of the intact living brain. Jens Frahm and his coworkers invented a rapid acquisition technique for magnetic resonance imaging termed [[FLASH MRI]] (fast low angle shot) technique which allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging.

== International Max Planck Research Schools ==
In 2000, two '''International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)''' were established together with the [http://www.uni-goettingen.de/ Georg August University Göttingen], the [http://www.dpz.eu/ German Primate Center] and the [http://www.em.mpg.de/ Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine]: the [[IMPRS for Molecular Biology]] and the [[IMPRS for Neurosciences]] (in cooperation with the [http://www.ds.mpg.de/ Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization] and the [http://www.eni.gwdg.de/ European Neuroscience Institute Göttingen]). A third graduate school, the IMPRS for Physics of Biological and Complex Systems, was opened in 2008 (in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26664">'''Mesoamerican architecture''' is the set of [[architecture|architectural]] traditions produced by [[pre-Columbian]] cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures (outside of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Chola Empire]]).

One interesting and widely researched topic is the relation between [[Cosmology|cosmovision]], [[religion]], [[geography]], and [[architecture]] in Mesoamerica. Much seems to suggest that many traits of Mesoamerican architecture were governed by religious and mythological ideas. For example, the layout of most Mesoamerican cities seem to be influenced by the [[cardinal directions]] and their [[Mythology|mythological]] and [[symbol]]ic meanings in Mesoamerican culture.

Another part of Mesoamerican architecture is its [[iconography]]. The monumental architecture of Mesoamerica was decorated with images of religious and cultural significance, and also in many cases with writing in some of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]]. Iconographic decorations and texts on buildings are important contributors to the overall current knowledge of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican society, history and religion.

==Urban planning and cosmovision==

===Cosmos and its replication===

====Symbolism====
[[Image:Teotihuacancityplan.png|300px|left|thumb|The layout of the city of Teotihuacan. The central part of the city is laid out following a north/south axis aligned about 15.5 degrees off, and which is marked by the "Street of the dead" The pyramid of the sun is in the center, built on an artificial cave. The southern part is skewed about 16.5 degrees east of north, following the orientation of the Ciudadela, mostly surrounded by residential quarters, while the northern part is the ceremonial center used for among other things human sacrifice.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Proskouriakoff Structure I at Xpuhil.jpg|thumb|Model of structure I of the Maya site of [[Xpuhil]].]] --&gt;
An important part of the [[Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican religious]] system was replicating their beliefs in concrete tangible forms, in effect making the world an embodiment of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube, introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the Mesoamerican city was constructed to be a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], manifesting the same division that existed in the religious, mythical geography—a division between the underworld and the human world. The underworld was represented by the direction north and many structures and buildings related to the underworld, such as tombs, are often found in the city's northern half. The southern part represented life, sustenance and rebirth and often contained structures related to the continuity and daily function of the city state, such as monuments depicting the noble lineages, or residential quarters, markets etc. Between the two halves of the north/south axis was the plaza, often containing stelae resembling the [[world tree]] the Mesoamerican [[axis mundi]], and a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] which served as a crossing point between the two worlds. 

Some Mesoamericanists argue that in religious symbolism the Mesoamerican monumental architecture pyramids were mountains, stelae were trees, and wells, ballcourts and [[cenote|cenotes]] were caves that provided access to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube write about this in their introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" pp. 31, they attribute this interpretation to Epigrapher David Stuart. American archeologist James E. Brady have done extensive research on importance of Caves in Mesoamerican culture. The title of the famous book "Forest of Kings" by Mayanist [[Linda Schele]] also alludes to the Maya belief that stelae represent trees, especially the world tree, axis mundi of the mayan cosmos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orientation====
Mesoamerican architecture is often designed to align to specific celestial events. Some pyramids, temples, and other structures were designed to achieve special lighting effects on particular days important in the Mesoamerican cosmovision. A famous example is the "[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]]" pyramid at [[Chichen Itza]], where a light-and-shadow effect can be observed during several weeks around the equinoxes. Contrary to a common opinion, however, there is no evidence that this phenomenon was the result of a purposeful design intended to commemorate the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=25 |issue=149 |pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Much Mesoamerican architecture is also aligned to roughly 15° east of north.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni and Gibbs.  Other researchers give other estimates or averages, but there is a remarkable consistency across time and space to this general orientation.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent H Malmstrom has argued&lt;ref&gt;In Chapter 22 of Archaeoastronomy in the Americas, edited by Ray A. Williamson, Ballena Press/Center for Archaeoastronomy, 1981, pp. 249–61, which can also be found at [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-15.pdf his website]. See also [http://www.jqjacobs.net/mesoamerica/meso_astro.html John Q Jacobs] article for more information on the alignments of Mesoamerican Cities&lt;/ref&gt; that this is because of a general wish to align the pyramids to face the sunset on August 13, which was the beginning date of the Maya [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] calendar. However, recent research has shown that the earliest orientations marking sunsets on August 13 (and April 30) occur outside of the Maya area. Their purpose must have been to record the dates separated by a period of 260 days (from August 13 to April 30), equivalent to the length of the sacred Mesoamerican calendrical count. In general, the orientations in Mesoamerican architecture tend to mark the dates separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days, i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system. The distribution of these dates in the year suggests that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars that facilitated the prediction of agriculturally significant dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |isbn=978-0-292-70504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions are supported by the results of systematic research accomplished in various Mesoamerican regions, including central Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura prehispánica del centro de México |date=2001 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-970-18-4180-8 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_OrientacionesCentroMexico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya Lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oaxaca, the Gulf Coast lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Oaxaca y el Golfo de México |date=2015 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-816-2 |url=http://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/pkc08_sprajc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and western and northern Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |last3=Cañas Ortiz |first3=Alejandro |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Occidente y Norte |date=2016 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-892-6 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/sprajc_orientaciones-astronomicas-en-la-arquitectura.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solar orientations prevail, some prominent buildings were aligned to Venus extremes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=The Venus-Rain-Maize Complex in the Mesoamerican World View: Part I |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=1993 |volume=24 |pages=17–70 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_Venus-rain-maize_part1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable example being the Governor's Palace at Uxmal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |editor1-last=Ruggles |editor1-first=Clive L.

===The Plaza===
At the heart of the Mesoamerican city were large plazas surrounded by the most important governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]].

===The Main Pyramids===
Often the most important religious temples sat atop the towering pyramids, presumably as the closest place to the heavens.  While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials.  Residing atop the pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]], the temples were impressive and decorated structures themselves.  Commonly topped with a [[roof comb]], or superficial grandiose wall, these temples might have served as a type of propaganda.

===The Ball court===
[[File:MesoBallcourtTeotenango.JPG|thumb|left|Mesoamerican ball court at Teotenango]]
[[File:Pok ta pok ballgame maya indians mexico 3.JPG|thumb|Replica Mesoamerican ball court.]]
[[File:Mesoamerican Ballcourt terminology schema.svg|thumb|left|Layout chart of a typical Mesoamerican ball court.]]

{{main|Mesoamerican ball court}}
The [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] ritual was a symbolic journey between the underworld and the world of the living, and many ball courts are found in the mid-part of the city functioning as a connection between the northern and southern halves of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Porter Weaver describes this on pp. 226–28 of the third edition of "The Aztecs, Maya and their Predecessors".&lt;/ref&gt;  All but the earliest ball courts are masonry structures.  Over 1300 ball courts have been identified, and although there is a tremendous variation in size, they all have the same general shape: a long narrow alley flanked by two walls with horizontal, sloping, and sometimes vertical faces. The later vertical faces, such as those at Chichen Itza and [[El Tajin]], are often covered with complex iconography and scenes of human sacrifice (see photo [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|here]]).

Although the alleys in early ball courts were open-ended, later ball courts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|7px]]-shape when viewed from above.  The playing alley may be at ground level, or the ball court may be "sunken".

Ball courts were no mean feats of engineering.  One of the [[sandstone]] stones on El Tajin's South Ball court is 11 m long and weighs more than 10 [[Tonne|tons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential Quarters and Palaces===
[[File:Uxmal - Quadrangulo de las Monjas - Nördlicher Palast 2.jpg|thumb|left|Limestone carvings on the ruined Uxmal palace.]]
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite.  Any exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis.  However, often these were one-story and consisted of many small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature.  Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs.  At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Pre-classic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] periods.

===Building materials===
[[File:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuacán).jpg|thumb|Teotihuacan style architecture displaying decorative ornamentation made of obsidian and shell inlaid into a painted [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] surface set upon a [[tezontle]] interior.]]
The most  surprising aspect of the great Mesoamerican structures is their lack of many advanced technologies that would seem to be necessary for such constructions. Lacking metal tools, Mesoamerican architecture required one thing in abundance: manpower.  Yet, beyond this enormous requirement, the remaining materials seem to have been readily available. They most often utilized [[limestone]], which remained pliable enough to be worked with stone tools while being quarried, and only hardened once when removed from its bed.  In addition to the structural use of limestone, much of their mortar consisted of crushed, burnt, and mixed limestone that mimicked the properties of cement and was used just as widely for [[stucco]] finishing as it was for mortar. However, later improvements in quarrying techniques reduced the necessity for this limestone-stucco as their stones began to fit quite perfectly, yet it remained a crucial element in some [[post and lintel]] roofs. A common building material in central Mexico was [[tezontle]] (a light, volcanic rock). It was common for palaces and monumental structures to be made of this rough stone and then covered with stucco or with a [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] [[Stone veneer|veneer]]. Very large and ornate architectural ornaments were fashioned from a very enduring stucco (kalk), especially in the Mayan region, where a type of hydraulic limestone cement or concrete was also used.&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Lost Secrets of Maya Technology Pompton Plaines: Career Press 2012, pp. 114–23&lt;/ref&gt;In the case of the common houses, wooden framing, [[adobe]], and thatch were used to build homes over stone foundations. However, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Buildings were typically finished with high slanted roofs usually built of wood or thatch although stone roofs in these high slant fashions are also used rarely.

==Styles==

===Megalithic===
[[Image:Taludtablero.png|right|thumb|150px|The talud-tablero style used in many Mesoamerican pyramids and a prominent stylistic feature of Teotihuacano architecture]]
An architectural construction technique that employs large dry-laid limestone blocks (ca. 1 m x 50&amp;nbsp;cm x 30&amp;nbsp;cm) covered with a thick layer of [[stucco]].  This style was common in the northern Maya lowlands from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] until the early parts of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]].

===Talud-tablero===
{{Main|Talud-tablero}}
Pyramids in Mesoamerican were platformed pyramids and many used a style called ''talud-tablero'', which first became common in Teotihuacan. This style consists of a platform structure, or the "tablero," on top of a sloped "talud". Many different variants on the talud-tablero style arose throughout Mesoamerica, developing and manifesting itself differently among the various cultures.

===Classic Period Maya styles===

Palenque, Tikal, Copan, Tonina, the corbeled arch.
[[Image:Uxmal-Great-Pyramid-Sculptured-Temple.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Puuc-style geometric design on a wall of the great temple of Uxmal.]]

==="Toltec" Style===
Chichén Itzá, Tula Hidalgo, [[chacmool]]s, [[Atlantean figures (Mesoamerica)|Atlantean figures]], Quetzalcoatl designs.

===Puuc===
{{Main|Puuc}}
So named after the Puuc hills in which this style developed and flourished during the latter portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] and throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] in the northern Maya lowlands, [[Puuc|Puuc architecture]] consists of veneer facing stones applied to a concrete core.  Two [[façade]]s were typically built, partitioned by a ridge of stone.  The blank lower façade is formed by flat cut stones and punctuated by doorways.  The upper partition is richly decorated with repeating geometric patterns and iconographic elements, especially the distinctive curved-nosed [[Chaac]] masks.  Carved columnettes are also common.

[[Image:Corbelledarch.png|thumb|left|100px|the principle of the "false" or corbelled arch is to build it without a keystone, but just with overlapping tiers of blocks]][[Image:Arco maya.jpg|right|thumb|100px|A fine example of a [[Corbel arch|corbelled arch]] from the mayan site of [[Uxmal]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]

===Corbelled Arch===
Mesoamerican cultures never invented the [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]], and so were unable to build true [[arch]]es, but instead all of their architecture made use of the "false" or [[Corbel arch|Corbelled arch]]. These arches are built without centering and can be built without support, by corbelling regularly the horizontal courses of the wall masonry. This type of arch supports much less weight than a true arch. 

However, recent work by engineer James O'Kon suggests the Mesoamerican "arch" is technically not a corbelled arch at all but a trapezium truss system. Moreover, unlike a corbelled arch, it does not rely on overlapping layers of blocks but cast-in-place concrete often supported by timber thrust beams. Computer analysis reveals this to be structurally superior to a curved arch&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Secrets of Maya Technology, Pompton PLains: New Page, 2012, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt; {{dubious|James O'Kon and arch 'superiority'|date=June 2015}}

=== True Arch ===
Scholars such as David Eccott and Gordon Ekholm argue that true arches were known in pre-Columbian times in Mesoamerica; they point to various examples of true arches at a Maya site in La Muneca, the facade of Temple A at Nukum, two low domes at Tajin in Veracruz, a sweat bath at Chichen Itza, and an arch at Oztuma &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwerin|first=Karl|title=The Arch in Mesoamerica|url=https://www.academia.edu/16405208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nC5ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=mesoamerica+true+arch#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoamerica%20true%20arch&amp;f=false|title=The Land of Prehistory: A Critical History of American Archaeology|last=Kehoe|first=Alice Beck|date=2015-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134720651|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.migration-diffusion.info/pdfdownload.php?id=72&amp;file=1|title=THE TRUE ARCH: AN ABSENT TRAIT IN PRECOLUMBIAN AMERICA?|last=Eccot|first=David J.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others.

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}
&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford|first=Eleanor J|last2=Hughes|first2=Mark|date=2015-06-01|title=Women's experiences of early miscarriage: implications for nursing care|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=11–12|pages=1457–1465|doi=10.1111/jocn.12781|pmid=25662397|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3463">'''Nanyang Style''' is a regional art movement expressed solely in the form of visual art. The first attempts to define the Nanyang Style were made by art historians, [[Redza Piyadasa]] and T.K. Sabapathy, in 1979, during a retrospective study of Nanyang artists’ works. This study was done in tribute to the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] (NAFA). The Nanyang style of painting was practised by migrant Chinese painters in Singapore in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Balagopal | first = Roberta | author2 = Yeo, Alicia | title = The Nanyang Style | publisher = [[National Library Board]] | date = 31 August 2009 | url = http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1626_2009-12-31.html | format = article | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110310064215/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1626_2009-12-31.html | archivedate = 10 March 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Chinese phrase 'nanyang' “南洋”, meaning south seas, stirred visions of tropical paradise. In the mid-20th century, a group of Chinese immigrants founded the Nanyang Style of art in [[Southeast Asia]] when they portrayed the rural scenes of Bali.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news | last = Yeo | first = Alicia | title = Singapore Art, ''Nanyang'' Style | newspaper = biblioasia | location = Singapore | pages = 4–11 | publisher = [[National Library Board]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0201Apr06.pdf | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227060158/http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0201Apr06.pdf | archivedate = 2012-02-27 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nanyang'' artists==
The pioneers of the Nanyang Style are [[Liu Kang (artist)|Liu Kang]], [[Chen Chong Swee]], [[Chen Wen Hsi]], [[Cheong Soo Pieng]] and [[Georgette Chen]], the first four of whom had received training in traditional Chinese watercolor painting in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Ting Szu Kiong | title = Nanyang Art | publisher = Central Singapore Community Development Council | year = 2005 | url = http://www.centralsingapore.org.sg/site/voices/voices8/page9.shtml | format = article | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091227173533/http://www.centralsingapore.org.sg/site/voices/voices8/page9.shtml | archivedate = 2009-12-27 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Redza Piyadasa states that Nanyang artists must be affiliated to NAFA, or a teacher or student in the school. This includes artists who studied privately under NAFA teachers.

==Styles==
The primary medium of Nanyang Style is Chinese ink and colour, or oil on canvas. A simple use of colours and lines is similar to those of [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionists]], such as [[Vincent van Gogh]]. The art style reflects the universal culture of migrants, who in this case adapted to and accepted a new mix of Western, Chinese and indigenous beliefs and practices.

==Controversies==
During the opening address of the ''Nanyang Art Over 40 years'' exhibition, [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|Acting Minister of Information, Communications and the Arts]] [[Lui Tuck Yew]] commentated that the Nanyang Style is not too distinctive on its own, being very similar to Chinese art.&lt;ref&gt;http://newslink.asiaone.com/user/UserSearch.action&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}

'''Non-verbal leakage''' is a form of [[body language]]. This happens when a person verbalizes one thing but their body language does another. The most common forms of non-verbal leakage are [[List of gestures|hand-to-face]] [[gestures]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P., Friesen, W., (1968). [http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Nonverbal-Leakage-And-Clues-To-Deception.pdf Nonverbal Leakage and Clues to Deception.] Journal for the Study of Interpersonal Processes,32, 88-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important concepts in the study of body language is that of non-verbal leakage. This occurs when we say one thing but our body language gestures give a different impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holler|first=Judith|last2=Shovelton|first2=Heather|last3=Beattie|first3=Geoffrey|date=2009-06-01|title=Do Iconic Hand Gestures Really Contribute to the Communication of Semantic Information in a Face-to-Face Context?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=73–88|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most obvious of these are hand-to-face gestures. The best way to understand these is to think how you behaved when you were a small child. What did you do then if you saw something frightening? You put your hands over your eyes, because in a toddler’s mind, if you can’t see it, it’s not there.  
  
If you aren’t aware of non-verbal leakage, your body language will scream out to your audience that something is wrong. They won’t necessarily know exactly what that is, but they will subconsciously pick up the incongruity between your verbal and non-verbal messages, and that you are uncomfortable in some way about what you are saying.
 
Therefore you need to know the telltale signs of leakage so you can avoid making them and rehearse your delivery showing open, confident body language instead.
So, what do people do when they see, hear or have to say something they are uncomfortable with?

==Hand To Eyes==
The same thing occurs, but the hand wipes the mouth, scratches the face or strokes the chin. This is especially common when politicians are listening to other people speak, as they are champing at the bit to reply but have to literally hold the words back.
This gesture can be mistaken for interest and deep thought, but when this occurs the hand tends to be lower and holds or strokes the chin without touching the mouth. It is the fingers covering the mouth that makes all the difference.

==Hand To Nose==
Touching of the nose during conversation can also imply lying.
This gesture is also common when someone has been asked a difficult question and they are thinking about how to reply. It may be accompanied by statements like, "That's a good question".
Of course, it could always be that the person has an itchy nose, but when someone scratches an itch it tends to be with a vigorous motion using the fingernail. The hand to nose gesture is slower and uses the knuckle or fingertip to scratch, or pinches the bridge of the nose.

In one study, liars gave more false smiles and embarrassed smiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biland|first=C.|last2=Py|first2=J.|last3=Allione|first3=J.|last4=Demarchi|first4=S.|last5=Abric|first5=J.-C.|title=The effect of lying on intentional versus unintentional facial expressions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1162908808000029|journal=Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology|volume=58|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.erap.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''online exhibition''', also referred to as a '''virtual exhibition''', '''online gallery''', '''cyber-exhibition''', is an [[exhibition]] whose venue is [[cyberspace]].

[[Museum]]s and other organizations create online exhibitions for many reasons.
For example, an online exhibition may: expand on material presented at, or generate interest in, or create a durable online record of, a physical exhibition;  save production costs (insurance, shipping, installation); solve conservation/preservation problems (e.g., handling of fragile or rare objects); reach lots more people: "Access to information is no longer restricted to those who can afford travel and museum visits, but is available to anyone who has access to a computer with an Internet connection.

Unlike physical exhibitions, online exhibitions are not restricted by time; they are not forced to open and close but may be available 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/MN_SO02_OnlineVisitor.cfm | title=Going Global: Reaching Out for the Online Visitor | author=Klaus Müller | publisher=American Association of Museums | accessdate=October 6, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonprofit world, many museums, [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[universities]], and other cultural organizations create online exhibitions. A database of such exhibitions is [[Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]]. Online exhibitions are also increasingly being utilized by businesses and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Online exhibition organizers may use techniques such as [[Marquee element|marquee text]], [[Display advertising|display advertisement]]s, and in-event [[email]]s to engage patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|title=4 Tips to Engage and Inform Attendees in Your Digital Event|last=Wolf|first=Lauren|date=11 October 2011|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143642/http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=September 2017}}

Various guides have been published to help organizations create effective online exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Thiel, S. (2007). ''Build It Once: A Basic Primer for the Creation of Online Exhibitions.'' The Scarecrow Press, Inc. {{ISBN|081085225X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalfatovic, M. (2002). ''Creating a Winning Online Exhibition: A Guide for Libraries, Archives, and Museums.'' American Library Association. {{ISBN|0838908179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest museum with a physical existence to create a programme of substantial online exhibitions with high resolution images of artefacts was the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, the first of which, ''The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century'' and an exhibition of early photographs, were published on 21 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/measurer/text/title.htm The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/features/ephotos/text.htm An exhibition of early photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also popular now are virtual exhibitions for business, participation in which allows you to save significant funds and cover a larger number of potential customers, without restriction on the place and time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://expo-online.center/ An example of an online platform with virtual exhibitions for business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of online exhibitions==
In recent years, new [[virtual museum]]s have published online exhibitions as : 
* [[UMA - Universal Museum of Art]] is an online-only museum which launched 2017. It has the ambition to work universal in virtual reality and is based on two principles: accessibility and innovation. UMA is offering exhibitions through the world art history, it's not connected to one top topic, country or region.
* [[International Museum of Women]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about women's issues globally as well as an online community. Online exhibitions include "Imagining Ourselves" (launched 2006) about women's identity, "Women, Power and Politics" (2008), and "Economica: Women and the Global Economy" (2009).
* [[Tucson LGBTQ Museum]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about LGBTQ history. The online photographic, audio, video, text, and other historical exhibitions include exhibits from the 1700s to the present day. The effort began in the summer of 1967 and spanned almost 50 years. 
* [[International New Media Gallery]] (INMG) is an online museum specialising in moving image and screen-based art. The INMG is dedicated to exploring current debates and topics in art history: touching on areas such as migration, war, environmental activism and the internet itself. The gallery publishes extensive academic catalogues alongside its exhibitions. It also hosts spaces for discussion and debate, both online and offline.
* [[Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art]] – the VMMNA is the first of its kind in Africa. Hosted by the [[Pan-African University, Lagos]], Nigeria this virtual museum offers a good view of the development on Nigerian Art in the past fifty years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">'''Pseudorationalism''' was the label given by economist and philosopher [[Otto Neurath]] to a school of thought that he was heavily critical of, throughout many of his writings but primarily in his 1913 paper "The lost wanderers of Descartes and the auxiliary motive" and later to a lesser extent in his 1935 "Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation |author=Otto Neurath |journal=[[Erkenntnis]] |year=1935 |volume=5 |number=1 |pages=353–365 |doi=10.1007/BF00172326}}&lt;/ref&gt; a review of and attack on [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s first book, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), contrasting this approach with his own view of what [[rationalism]] should properly be.{{sfn|Uebel|2008|p=54}}  Neurath aimed his criticism at a [[René Descartes|Cartes]]ian belief that all actions can be subject to rational analysis,{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}} saying that

{{quote|Once reason has gained a certain influence, people generally show a tendency to regard all their actions as reasonable.  Ways of action which depend on dark instincts receive reinterpretation or obfuscation.|{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}} {{harvnb|Neurath|1913|p=441}}}}

Neurath considered that "pseudo-rationalists", be they philosophers or scientists, made the mistake of assuming that a complete rational system could be devised for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].  He argued rather that no system could be complete, being based upon a picture of reality that could only ever be incomplete and imperfect.  Pseudo-rationalism, in Neurath's view, was a refusal or simple inability to face up to the limits of rationality and reason.{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}  "Rationalism", he wrote {{harv|Neurath|1913|p=8}}, "sees its chief triumph in the clear recognition of the limits of actual insight.".  Whereas a pseudorationalist acknowledges no such limits, but rather contents that ''all'' decisions can be subject to the rules of insight.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}  Scientific method is, according to Neurath, pseudorationalist where it contends that the rules for the [[scientific method]] will always lead ever closer to the truth.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}

Neurath further challenged Cartesian "pseudorationalism" by asserting that operating upon incomplete data was in fact the norm, where Cartesian thinking would have it be the rare exception.  Rather than there being one, final, rational answer to any given problem, Neurath asserted that scientific endeavour required a continuing and never-ending series of choices, made so in part because of the ambiguity of language.{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}

'''''Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] in the field of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]]. It was founded in 1971, with close ties to the Religious Studies program at the [[Lancaster University|University of Lancaster]]. That program was founded and chaired by [[Ninian Smart]], and he served as the Chairman of the first editorial board. Four companies have published the journal over the years: Oriel Press (1971–72), [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] (1973–80), [[Academic Press]] (1981–2000), [[Elsevier]] (2001–2010), and currently [[Routledge]].

''Religion'' publishes academic work on all issues of Religious Studies, including the history, literature, thought, practise, material culture, and institutions of particular religious traditions from a variety of perspectives such as social scientific, humanistic, cognitive, economical, geographical, etc. (but excluding work that falls purely within the areas of theology or philosophy of religion). The journal has European and North-American editors (currently [[Michael Stausberg]] and [[Steven Engler]]) and a multi-national Editorial Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=rrel20 Publisher site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seuso Treasure''' or '''Sevso Treasure''' ({{lang-hu|Seuso-kincsek}}; {{lang-hr|Seusovo blago}}), is a [[hoard]] of [[silver]] objects (14 items) from the late [[Roman Empire]]. The first pieces appeared on the market in [[London]] in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]]. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of [[Lebanon]]. It was put up for sale in [[New York City]] in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of [[Hungary]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Lebanon]] made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. [[Scotland Yard]] still has an open case on the matter.

The origin and [[provenance]] of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Time Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide/series-119/episode-3 |title=Time Team Specials – The Mystery of the Roman Treasure – Channel 4 |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014 [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140326_Orban_Magyarorszag_visszaszerezte_a_Seuso#rss |title=Orbán: Magyarország visszaszerezte a Seuso-kincset |publisher=hvg.hu |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/03/26/3101774/hungary-buys-back-7-roman-era.html?sp=/99/109/ |title=Hungary buys back 7 Roman-era silver trays, jugs|publisher=idahostatesman.com |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister described it as "Hungary's family silverware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/budapest/sevso-treasure-hungarys-family-silverware-returned_77609 |title=Sevso Treasure, "Hungary's family silverware," returned |publisher=Budapest Business Journal |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20170712_Baan_hetek_ota_itthon_van_a_Seusokincs_a_TEK_hozta_haza |title=Baán: Hetek óta itthon van a Seuso-kincs, a TEK hozta haza |publisher=HVG |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The [[treasure trove]] consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9&amp;nbsp;kg, which bears the inscription:

: ''Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa''
: ''Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis''

: May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be
: Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily.

==Discovery==
[[File:Sümegh józsef 02.jpg|thumb|right|190px|József Sümegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975–76 near Polgárdi]]The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from [[Vienna]] was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;[http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no Antiques Trade Gazette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001509/http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no |date=2007-09-29 }}, 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], described as being from "what was once the province of [[Phoenicia]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]".

=== Legal wrangling ===
The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of [[Polgárdi]] in central Hungary. Sümegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed.&lt;ref name = "Múlt-Kor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?id=20036&amp;pIdx=2 |title=Helyi divattal igazolják a Seuso-kincsek eredetét – Hírek – Múlt-kor történelmi magazin |publisher=mult-kor.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref name = "HVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon.bunugy/20120803_seuso_gyilkossag |title=Bűnügy: Bors: újra nyomoz az NNI a Seuso-kincseket megtaláló Sümegh meggyilkolása ügyében – HVG.hu |publisher=hvg.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of [[Barbariga, Croatia|Barbariga]] in [[Istria]] (present-day [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of [[Pula]], an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) compound.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by [[Vesna Girardi-Jurkić]], to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peritz|first1=Romina|title=Borba za neprocjenjivo Seusovo blago|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/borba-za-neprocjenjivo-seusovo-blago-%E2%80%98do-zadnjeg-smo-vjerovali-da-jehrvatsko%E2%80%99/988673/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 203 A.D.2d 167, 610 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1994); ''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 232 A.D.2d 616, 648 N.Y.S.2d 25 (1st Dep't 1996).)&lt;/ref&gt; The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors [[Allen &amp; Overy]] for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the [[House of Lords]], the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Stationery"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|title=Sevso Case: Decision not to Prosecute|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|date=25 June 1999|column=WA111|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012090039/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|archive-date=2006-10-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the "Hunting Plate", an inscription is to be seen. It reads "Pelso", the Roman name for [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law|author1=Gibbon, K.F. |author2=American Council for Cultural Policy|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813536873 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigTNxl30ZgC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman [[tripod]] (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-curse-of-the-sevso-silver/302331/|title=The Curse of the Sevso Silver – The Atlantic|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In September 2006, London auctioneer [[Bonhams]] announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date.&lt;ref name="ATG" /&gt; A spokesman for the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.hu/culture/history/news/D999_news_200486.html "Sevso Treasure Up For Sale" at culture.hu – Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn]], particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|admission to the European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61012w0001.htm ''Hansard''] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/afrontpage/pdf/tancurrent.pdf Art Newspaper], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2393777,00.html Times] and [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924109,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vadász tál - Seuso kiállítás, Országház (3).JPG|thumb|right|The "Hunting plate" in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]

In March 2007, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that a further "187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=581 |title=The silver missing from the Sevso hoard? |publisher=theartnewspaper.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/lisa-westcott/sevso-treasure.htm |title=Archaeology of the Sevso Treasure &amp;#124; Current Archaeology  |publisher=archaeology.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel 4]] archaeology programme ''[[Time Team]]'' aired a [[Time Team (specials)#2008|special on the treasure]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide |title=Time Team Specials – Episode Guide – Channel 4  |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of [[Polgárdi]]. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.

==Return to Hungary==
On 26 March 2014, [[Viktor Orbán]], the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2" /&gt; The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungarian PM]] announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20170712_orban_seuso_kincs_hazakerult#rss |title=Orbán: Hazakerült a Seuso-kincsek további hét darabja |publisher=hvg.hu |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items will be moved to the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

The '''SSRN''', formerly known as Social Science Research Network, is a repository devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities and it has been expanding into the life, physical, health, and applied sciences since 2017. In May 2016,  SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier|title=SSRN — a leading social science and humanities repository and online community — joins Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
SSRN was founded in 1994 by [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and Wayne Marr, both [[financial economics|financial economists]].

In January 2013, SSRN was ranked the biggest open-access repository in the world by Ranking Web of Repositories (an initiative of the [[Cybermetrics Lab]], a research group belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|title=World|date=January 2013|publisher=Cybermetrics Lab|work=Ranking Web of Repositories|accessdate=11 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629031236/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|archive-date=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured by number of PDF files, backlinks and Google Scholar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|title=Methodology|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701033427/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|archivedate=2013-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016,  SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2016 there were reports of papers being removed from SSRN without notice; revision comments from SSRN indicated this was due to copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160718/02211935003/just-as-open-competitor-to-elseviers-ssrn-launches-ssrn-accused-copyright-crackdown.shtml|title=Just As Open Competitor To Elsevier's SSRN Launches, SSRN Accused Of Copyright Crackdown|website=Techdirt|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRN CEO Gregg Gordon characterized the issue as a mistake affecting about 20 papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/19/social-science-research-network-confusion-leads-calls-boycott|title='There Isn't Some Big Conspiracy Happening'|website=Inside Higher Ed|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2017, SSRN has been adding new disciplines in areas such as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, computer science and more. 

== Operations ==
Academic papers in PDF format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available around the world via download. Users can also subscribe to abstracting emails covering a broad range of research areas and topic specialties. These distributing emails contain abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

SSRN, like other preprint services, circulates publications throughout the scholarly community at an early stage, permitting the author to incorporate comments into the final version of the paper before its publication in a journal. Moreover, even if access to the published paper is restricted, access to the original working paper remains open through SSRN, so long as the author decides to keep the paper up.  Often authors take papers down at the request of publishers, particularly if they are published by commercial or university presses that depend on payment for paper copies or online access.

Academic papers in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available for worldwide free downloading. Publishers and institutions can upload papers and charge a fee for readers to download them.&lt;ref name="About_SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrn.com/update/general/mjensen.html |title=About SSRN |first=Michael C. |last=Jensen |authorlink=Michael C.

These e-journals then periodically distribute emails containing abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

On SSRN, authors and papers are ranked by their number of downloads, which has become an informal indicator of popularity on prepress and [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernard S.

'''Teaching artists''', also known as '''art teachers''' or '''artist educators''' or '''community artists''', are [[artist|professional artists]] who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, [[After-school activity|after school programs]], community agencies, [[prison]]s, jails, and [[Social services|social service]] agencies. The ''Arts In Education'' movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm History of Teaching Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227120148/http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm |date=2012-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts learning consultant [[Eric Booth]] has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about [[the arts]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124354/http://nysaae.org/docs/The_History_of_Teaching_Artistry_By_Eric_Booth.pdf Booth Article]&lt;/ref&gt; This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm Teaching Artist described] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005527/http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate]], ''Journal of a Living Experiment, a documentary history of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative and the writers-in-the-schools movement.''

On April 16, 2011 the [[Association of Teaching Artists]] convened the First National Teaching Artists Forum. The forum was held at [[The Center for Arts Education]] in [[New York City]] with nearly fifty participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/TAforum.htm Teaching Artists Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005346/http://www.teachingartists.com/TAforum.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3574">'''The ''Nationwide'' Project''' was an influential [[media audience research]] project conducted by the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], England, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its principal researchers were [[David Morley (academic)|David Morley]] and [[Charlotte Brunsdon]].

==Initial stage==

The Media Group at the CCCS selected the [[BBC television]] current affairs programme ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'' to study the [[Encoding/Decoding Model of Communication|encoding/decoding model]], a part of [[reception theory]], developed by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]. This study was concerned with "the programme's distinctive ideological themes and with the particular ways in which ''Nationwide'' addressed the viewer".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moores|1993|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first part of the study was published by Brunsdon and Morley in 1978.

==Stage two==

Morley conducted [[qualitative research]] with various participants from different educational and occupational backgrounds. He observed different responses to a clip of its [[Government budget|budget]] special to see whether they would construct dominant, oppositional or negotiated readings (the three categories of readings proposed by Hall).

Management groups produced dominant readings, while teacher training students and university arts students produced negotiated readings. Trade union groups characteristically produced oppositional or negotiated readings. Black college students, however, "fail[ed] to engage with the [[discourse]] of the programme enough to reconstruct or redefine it".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1980|pp=142–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial conclusion was that decodings cannot be traced solely to socioeconomic position, since members of the sample occupying the same class location produced different readings. However, Sujeong Kim's statistical re-analysis of the project's findings suggests that this may be an underinterpretation: according to Kim, the results show that 'audience's social positions ... structure their understandings and evaluations of television programmes in quite consistent directions and patterns.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2004|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kim observes that middle class viewers produced negotiated readings of one particular programme, while working class viewers produced dominant or oppositional readings dependent on their gender and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2004|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''''' ({{lang-ar|الروض العاطر في نزهة الخاطر}} ''Al-rawḍ al-ʿāṭir fī nuzhaẗ al-ḫāṭir'') by [[Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi]] is a fifteenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[sex manual]] and work of [[erotic literature]].

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about [[sexual health]], and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the [[Human penis|penis]] and [[vagina]], has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

According to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote ''The Perfumed Garden'' sometime during the twelfth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi,&lt;ref&gt;أبو عبدالله محمد ابن عمر النفزاوي&lt;/ref&gt; was born among the [[Berbers|Berber]] Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day [[Tunisia]]. He compiled at the request of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] ruler of [[Tunis]], Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.

==Translations==

===1886: Burton English translation===
''The Perfumed Garden'' first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of [[Pietro Aretino|Aretin]] and [[Rabelais]], and the French book ''Conjugal Love'' by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes ''The Perfumed Garden'' unique in the genre is "the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented." Burton points out that not all of the ideas in ''The Perfumed Garden'' are original: "For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi]]; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book ''Birds and Flowers'' by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams."

The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled ''The Scented Garden'', was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.

=== 1976: Khawam French translation ===
A new French translation by [[René R. Khawam]] was published in 1976.

=== 1999: Colville English translation ===
In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English ''Perfumed Garden'' translated directly from the Arabic original.  Of the Burton translation, he says, "details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources.  The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation.  The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original".

Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled "Sexual Technique" in Colville's translation and "Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition" in Burton's.  Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these.  Colville's translation is 2½ pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.

==Inspiration for musical works==
In 1923 the English composer [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji]] wrote ''Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/04-sourc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAH Band]] released a single entitled “Perfumed Garden” in 1982.

Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish [[melodic death metal|melodic death metal band]], also wrote a song called "The Perfumed Garden", released on their "Spirits and August Light" album in 2003.

[[Ray Manzarek]], inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.

The collection comprises ~225,000 sets of bird eggs representing approximately 4,000 species, including all orders of extant birds; ~20,000 nests; and more than 56,000 bird study skins from around the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable corporation, is both a natural history collection specializing in eggs and nests of birds from around the world, and a research and education institution dedicated to bird conservation. The Foundation's collections are among the largest in the world, and its mission is to contribute to the conservation of the world’s wild bird species through the accessibility of the collections and their data to researchers, educators, students, and the public.  The WFVZ also contributes to bird conservation through bird education programs for scientific professionals and the public, and field- and collections-based bird conservation research projects and publications.  
The Western Foundation’s collections have contributed to multiple scientific fields (e.g., conservation, ecology, taxonomy, and toxicology).{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} The Foundation’s egg sets have also figured prominently in studies of eggshell thinning due to contaminants (e.g., DDT and heavy metals).

It publishes a journal, the ''Proceedings of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology''.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}
