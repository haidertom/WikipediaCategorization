'''Agropolis Fondation''', extended name "Montpellier Agricultural Sciences and Sustainable Development” was created in France on Feb. 21st, 2007 by the three initial founding institutions [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[CIRAD]], and [[SupAgro|Montpellier SupAgro]].
&lt;br&gt;It constitutes the legal frame of the thematic network for advanced research (RTRA) “Agricultural Sciences and Sustainable Development”, a network of research units (further described below), selected in 2006 together with twelve other networks for advanced research in various disciplines (''e.g.'' [[Paris School of Economics]]) by the French Ministry for Research and higher education.
&lt;br&gt;The Foundation is to promote the development of scientific projects of international level (research programmes and education through research) in the field of agronomy and sustainable development in relation to both North and South issues.

== Scientific frame of the network ==
The network scientific priorities relate to the following global issues :
*An increased demand for plants, for both food and non-food purposes
*The necessary adaption of crops to climate change
*The prevention of risks such as plant pests and diseases, diminishing natural resources, risks related to food safety, social risks…

The network is composed of high level scientific teams, organized in two tightly connected fields :
*Plant integrative biology, in the broadest sense: genetics and genomics, plant breeding, ecophysiology; plant pests and diseases, integrated crop protection, population ecology…
*Socio-technical dynamics of innovation : agri-environmental innovation, food industry innovation, social innovation and social management of innovation

The thematics involved are centering on the plant : the plant, from the gene to the whole plant ; the plant in its environment; plant products and their food and non-food uses…

==A network of research Units==
In 2007, the network is composed of 29 research units (including 19 joint research units and 10 in-house research units);

Approx. 780 scientists are involved : 
*580 scientists belonging to the three initial founding institutions (500 working in Montpellier and Avignon and 80 scientists abroad).
*200 scientists from partner institutions of the joint research units ([[CNRS]], IRD, the [[University of Montpellier]] I and II, the [http://www.univ-avignon.fr/ University of Avignon], and [http://www.iamm.fr/index.php CIHEAM-IAMM])

==Aims of the Foundation==

The Foundation is aiming at

*increasing the international openness, attractiveness and renown of the Montpellier agronomic research complex especially by attracting high level foreign scientists and by contributing to the development of international cooperation projects.
*stimulating the collaboration between the research units in the network.
*strengthening the offer in education through research especially towards students from emerging and developing countries

To fulfill these aims, the foundation will support incoming high level foreign scientists, finance post-doctoral and doctoral positions,  contribute to the development of structuring technological projects (''i.e.'' technical platforms, shared equipment…),  support thematic training sessions and scientific events of international importance, as well as various others actions (release from teaching duties, support for the setting up of international projects …).

The Foundation’s actions are to be linked to those of the [[Agropolis International]] association to allow Montpellier institutions involved in agricultural sciences as a whole (totalizing approx. 2300 scientists) to reach the same international repute as other agricultural research institutes at European (e.g. [[Wageningen University]], with 1400 scientists) or international (e.g. the  [[CGIAR]] centers network, with 1800 scientists) level.

{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}
An '''and-inverter graph (AIG)''' is a directed, acyclic [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that represents a structural implementation of the logical functionality of a [[digital circuit|circuit or network]].  An AIG consists of two-input nodes representing [[logical conjunction]], terminal nodes labeled with variable names, and edges optionally containing markers indicating [[logical negation]].  This representation of a logic function is rarely structurally efficient for large circuits, but is an efficient representation for manipulation of [[boolean function]]s. Typically, the abstract graph is represented as a [[data structure]] in software.
[[Image:And-inverter-graph.svg|thumb|400px|Two structurally different AIGs for the function f(x1, x2, x3) = x2 * ( x1 + x3 )]]

Conversion from the network of [[logic gate]]s to AIGs is fast and scalable. It only requires that every gate be expressed in terms of [[AND gate]]s and [[inverter (logic gate)|inverters]]. This conversion does not lead to unpredictable increase in memory use and runtime.  This makes the AIG an efficient representation in comparison with either the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) or the "sum-of-product" (ΣoΠ) form,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the [[canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] known as the [[disjunctive normal form]] (DNF). The BDD and DNF may also be viewed as circuits, but they involve formal constraints that deprive them of scalability.  For example, ΣoΠs are circuits with at most two levels while BDDs are canonical, that is, they require that input variables be evaluated in the same order on all paths.

Circuits composed of simple gates, including AIGs, are an "ancient" research topic. The interest in AIGs started with Alan Turing's seminal 1948 paper&lt;ref&gt;Turing's 1948 paper has been re-printed as Turing AM. Intelligent Machinery. In: Ince DC, editor. ''Collected works of AM Turing &amp;mdash; Mechanical Intelligence.'' Elsevier Science Publishers, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; on neural networks, in which he described a randomized trainable network of NAND gates.   Interest continued through the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =L. Hellerman|title=A catalog of three-variable Or-Inverter and And-Inverter logical circuits|journal=IEEE Trans. Electron. Comput.|volume=EC-12|date=June 1963|pages=198&amp;ndash;223|doi=10.1109/PGEC.1963.263531|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in the 1970s when various local transformations have been developed.  These transformations were implemented in several
logic synthesis and verification systems, such as Darringer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Darringer |author2=W. H. Joyner, Jr. |author3=C. L. Berman |author4=L. Trevillyan |title=Logic synthesis through local transformations|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=25|issue=4|date=Jul 1981|pages=272&amp;ndash;280|doi=10.1147/rd.254.0272|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.7515&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. L. Smith |author2=R. J. Bahnsen |author3=H. Halliwell |title=Boolean comparison of hardware and flowcharts|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=26|issue=1|date=Jan 1982|pages=106&amp;ndash;116|doi=10.1147/rd.261.0106|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.2196&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduce circuits to improve area and delay during synthesis, or to speed up [[formal equivalence checking]]. Several important techniques were discovered early at [[IBM]], such as combining and reusing multi-input logic expressions and subexpressions, now known as [[structural hashing]].

Recently there has been a renewed interest in AIGs as a [[Functional Representation|functional representation]] for a variety of tasks in synthesis and verification. That is because representations popular in the 1990s (such as BDDs) have reached their limits of scalability in many of their applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Another important development was the recent emergence of much more efficient [[boolean satisfiability]] (SAT) solvers. When coupled with ''AIGs'' as the circuit representation, they lead to remarkable speedups in solving a wide variety of [[boolean problem]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

AIGs found successful use in diverse [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] applications. A well-tuned combination of ''AIGs'' and [[boolean satisfiability]] made an impact on [[formal verification]], including both [[model checking]] and equivalence checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Kuehlmann |author2=V. Paruthi |author3=F. Krohm |author4=M. K. Ganai |title=Robust boolean reasoning for equivalence checking and functional property verification|journal=IEEE Trans.

ICCAD '04|pages=42&amp;ndash;49|date=2004|url=http://www.perbjesse.com/iccad04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing understanding that logic and physical synthesis problems can be solved using simulation and [[boolean satisfiability]] to compute functional properties (such as symmetries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=K.-H. Chang |author2=I. L. Markov |author3=V. Bertacco |title=Post-placement rewiring and rebuffering by exhaustive search for functional symmetries|booktitle=Proc.

Mishchenko |author2=J. S. Zhang |author3=S. Sinha |author4=J. R. Burch |author5=R. Brayton |author6=M.

ICCAD | pages=254&amp;mdash;261 | date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishchenko et al. shows that AIGs are a promising ''unifying'' representation, which can bridge [[logic synthesis]], [[technology mapping]], physical synthesis, and formal verification.  This is, to a large extent, due to the simple and uniform structure of AIGs, which allow rewriting, simulation, mapping, placement, and verification to share the same data structure.

In addition to combinational logic, AIGs have also been applied to [[sequential logic]] and sequential transformations.  Specifically, the method of structural hashing was extended to work for AIGs with memory elements (such as [[flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip-flop]]s with an initial state,
which, in general, can be unknown) resulting in a data structure that is specifically tailored for applications related to [[retiming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=J. Baumgartner |author2=A. Kuehlmann |title=Min-area retiming on flexible circuit structures|booktitle= Proc. ICCAD'01|pages=176&amp;ndash;182|date=2001|url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/es/info/iwls01_ret.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research includes implementing a modern logic synthesis system completely based on AIGs.  The prototype called [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ ABC] features an AIG package, several AIG-based synthesis and equivalence-checking techniques, as well as an experimental implementation of sequential synthesis. One such technique combines technology mapping and retiming in a single optimization step. These optimizations can be implemented using networks composed of arbitrary gates, but the use of AIGs makes them more scalable and easier to implement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9760">'''Automatic identification and data capture''' (AIDC) refers to the methods of automatically identifying objects, collecting [[Data (computing)|data]] about them, and entering them directly into [[computer]] systems, without human involvement. Technologies typically considered as part of AIDC include [[bar codes]], [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)]], [[biometrics]] (like [[iris recognition|iris]] and [[facial recognition system]]), [[magnetic stripe]]s, [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR), [[smart cards]], and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]. AIDC is also commonly referred to as “Automatic Identification”, “Auto-ID” and "Automatic Data Capture".

AIDC is the process or means of obtaining external data, particularly through analysis of [[image]]s, [[sound]]s or [[video]]s. To capture data, a [[transducer]] is employed which converts the actual image or a sound into a digital file. The file is then stored and at a later time it can be analyzed by a computer, or compared with other files in a database to verify identity or to provide authorization to enter a secured system. Capturing of data can be done in various ways; the best method depends on application.

In biometric security systems, capture is the acquisition of or the process of acquiring and identifying characteristics such as finger image, palm image, facial image, iris print or voice print which involves audio data and the rest all involves video data.

Radio-frequency identification is relatively a new AIDC technology which was first developed in 1980s. The technology acts as a base in automated data collection, identification and analysis systems worldwide. RFID has found its importance in a wide range of markets, including [[Animal identification|livestock identification]] and Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems because of its capability to track moving objects. These automated wireless AIDC systems are effective in manufacturing environments where barcode labels could not survive.

==Overview of automatic identification methods ==
Nearly all of the automatic identification technologies consist of three principal components, which also comprise the sequential steps in AIDC-
1 Data encoder . A code is a set of symbols or signals that usually represent alphanumeric characters. When data are encoded, the characters are translated into a machine readable code. A label or tag containing the encoded data is attached to the item that is to be identified.
2 Machine reader or scanner. This device reads the encoded data, converting them to alternative form, usually an electrical analog signal.
3 Data decoder. This component transforms the electrical signal into digital data and finally  back into the original alphanumeric characters.

==Capturing data from printed documents==
One of the most useful application tasks of data capture is collecting information from paper documents and saving it into databases (CMS, ECM and other systems). There are several types of basic technologies used for data capture according to the data type:{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

These basic technologies allow extracting information from paper documents for further processing it in the enterprise information systems such as [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The documents for data capture can be divided into 3 groups: '''structured''', '''semi-structured''' '''and unstructured'''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Structured documents''' (questionnaires, tests, insurance forms, tax returns, ballots, etc.) have completely the same structure and appearance. It is the easiest type for data capture, because every data field is located at the same place for all documents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Semi-structured documents''' (invoices, purchase orders, waybills, etc.) have the same structure but their appearance depends on number of items and other parameters. Capturing data from these documents is a complex, but solvable task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yi|first=Jeonghee|date=Fall 2000|title=A classifier for semi-structured documents|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=13B1E16BC52B74FE4373CD864444B81A?doi=10.1.1.87.2662&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=340 - 344|doi=10.1145/350000/347164/p340-yi.pdf|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unstructured documents''' (letters, contracts, articles, etc.) could be flexible with structure and appearance.

==The Internet and the future==

The idea is as simple as its application is difficult. If all cans, books, shoes or parts of cars are equipped with minuscule identifying devices, daily life on our planet will undergo a transformation. Things like running out of stock or wasted products will no longer exist as we will know exactly what is being consumed on the other side of the globe. Theft will be a thing of the past as we will know where a product is at all times. Counterfeiting of critical or costly items such as drugs, repair parts, or electronic components will be reduced or eliminated because manufacturers or other supply chain entities will know where their products are at all times. Product wastage or spoilage will be reduced because environmental sensors will alert suppliers or consumers when sensitive products are exposed to excessive heat, cold, vibration, or other risks. Supply chains will operate far more efficiently because suppliers will ship only the products needed when and where they are needed. Consumer and supplier prices should also drop accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |place = London |year = 2008 | pages = 205–214 |isbn = 1-84704-002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global association [[Auto-ID Center]] was founded in 1999 and is made up of 100 of the largest companies in the world such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Pfizer]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Unilever]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], companies working in the sector of technology such as SAP, Aliens, Sun as well as five academic research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/automation/documents/centerguide.pdf |title= The New Network |author= Auto-ID Center |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are based at the following Universities; MIT in the USA, Cambridge University in the UK, the University of Adelaide in Australia, Keio University in Japan and University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

The Auto-ID Center suggests a concept of a future supply chain that is based on the Internet of objects, i.e. a global application of RFID. They try to harmonize technology, processes and organization. Research is focused on miniaturization (aiming for a size of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm/chip), reduction in the price per single device (aiming at around $0.05 per unit), the development of innovative application such as payment without any physical contact (Sony/Philips), domotics (clothes equipped with radio tags and intelligent washing machines), and sporting events (timing at the Berlin marathon).

==AIDC 100==
[[AIDC 100]] is a professional organization for the automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) industry. This group is composed of individuals who made substantial contributions to the advancement of the industry. Increasing business's understanding of AIDC processes and technologies are the primary goals of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDC 100|url=http://www.aidc100.org|work=AIDC 100: Professionals Who Excel in Serving the AIDC Industry|accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230937/http://www.aidc100.org/| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Besselian elements''' are a set of values used to calculate and predict the local circumstances of [[occultation]]s for an observer on Earth. This method is particularly used for [[solar eclipses]], but is also applied for occultations of [[star]]s or [[planet]]s by the [[Moon]] and [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of [[Transit of Venus|Venus]] or [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury]]. In addition, for [[lunar eclipse]]s a similar method is used, in which the shadow is cast on the Moon instead of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.1"&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann: ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac.'' page 421f, see further reading&lt;/ref&gt;

For solar eclipses, the Besselian elements are used to calculate the path of the [[umbra, penumbra and antumbra|umbra and penumbra]] on the Earth's surface, and hence the circumstances of the eclipse at a specific location. This method was developed in the 1820s by the German mathematician and astronomer, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], and later improved by [[William Chauvenet]].

The basic concept is that Besselian elements describe the movement of the shadow cast by the occulting body –&amp;nbsp;for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon&amp;nbsp;– on a specifically chosen plane, called the ''fundamental plane''. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of the occulting and  the occulted bodies.&lt;ref name="MuckeMeeus1992"&gt;[[Hermann Mucke (astronomer)|Hermann Mucke]], [[Jean Meeus]]: ''Canon of solar eclipses: -2003 to +2526.'' Astronomisches Büro, Wien 1992, Seite XXXIII–LI&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no [[perspective projection distortion|perspective distortion]].

Comparatively few values are needed to accurately describe the movement of the shadow on the fundamental plane. Based on this, the next step is to [[Graphical projection|project]] the shadow cone on to the Earth's surface, taking into account the [[figure of the Earth]], its [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], and the observer's [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[elevation]].&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.32"&gt;P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2924">In [[archaeology]], a '''biofact''' (or '''ecofact''') is organic material found at an [[archaeological site]] that carries archaeological significance.

{{Politics}}
The interdisciplinary study of '''biology and political science''' is the application of theories and methods from the biology toward the scientific understanding of [[political behavior]]. The field is sometimes called '''[[biopolitics]]''', a term that will be used in this article as a synonym although it has other, less related meanings. More generally, the field has also been called "[[politics]] and the [[life sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Robert H., and Samuel M. Hines. 2001. ''Biology and Political Science''. New York: Routledge; Somit, A., and S. A. Peterson. 1998. "Review article: Biopolitics after three decades - A balance sheet." British Journal of Political Science 28:559-71; Masters, Roger D. 1989. ''The Nature of Politics''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
The field can be said to originate with the 1968 manifesto of [[Albert Somit]], ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', which appeared in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Maxwell|title=The Sociobiological Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OPxMX-2h2cC&amp;pg=PA142|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0768-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|2110295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopolitics" was appropriated for this area of study by [[Thomas Thorton]], who used it as the title of his 1970 book.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"/&gt;

The [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]] was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal called ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (PLS). The journal is edited in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]’s School of Public Policy, in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Politics and the Life Sciences|url=http://www.aplsnet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and since, biopolitics research has expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of [[evolutionary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, and Robert Kurzban. 2003. "Evolutionary Approaches to Political Psychology." In ''Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology'', ed. D. O. Sears, L. Huddie and R. Jervis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Alford, J. R., C. L. Funk, and J. R. Hibbing. 2005. "Are political orientations genetically transmitted?" American Political Science Review 99 (2):153-67; Hatemi, Peter K., Carolyn L. Funk, Hermine Maes, Judy Silberg, Sarah E. Medland, Nicholas Martin, and Lyndon Eaves. 2009. "Genetic Influences on Political Attitudes over the Life Course." Journal of Politics 71 (3):1141-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Darren. 2011. "From SCAN to Neuropolitics. In ''Man is By Nature a Political Animal'', edited by P. K. Hatemi and R. McDermott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical link between biology and politics on the one hand, and sociological organicism on the other, is inescapable.  The essential difference here is that the early modern application of biological ideas to politics revolved around the idea that society was a ‘social organism’, whereas the subject this article describes expressly sets out to separate the essential logic of the association of biology to human social life, from this earlier model.  Hence the emphasis upon ‘politics’, denoting the primacy of the individual who engages in social life, as in political behaviour, underpinned by biological foundations.  In this sense the rise of Biopolitics represents the replacement of sociological organicism that had been eradicated by the end of the Second World War, with an acceptable form of political organicism.  Some discussion bearing on this point may be found in ''Biology and Politics : Recent Explorations'' by Albert Somit, 1976, which is a collection of essays, one brief essay by William Mackenzie is ''Biopolitics : A Minority Viewpoint'', in which he talks about the ‘founding father’ of Biopolitics as being Morley Roberts, because of his 1938 book of that name.  But Roberts was not using the term in its modern, politically sanitized sense, but in the context of society viewed as a true living being, a social organism.  And in a reply to Somit’s ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', published in the same journal, we find ''Some Questions about a More Biologically Oriented Political Science'' by Jerone Stephens, which sets out to warn against lurching back into the errors of previous venturers into the realms of biology and politics, as in sociological organicism.

== History ==
Hunter &amp; Ready initiated the first known bug bounty program in 1983 for their [[Versatile Real-Time Executive]] operating system. Anyone who found and reported a bug would receive a Volkswagen Beetle (aka Bug) in return. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cybersecuritysf/status/883829319604293632|title=The  first “bug” bounty program|date=8 July 2017|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little over a decade later in 1995, Jarrett Ridlinghafer, a technical support engineer at [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] coined the phrase 'Bugs Bounty'.

Netscape encouraged its employees to push themselves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Ridlinghafer recognized that Netscape had many enthusiasts and evangelists for their products, some of whom to him seemed even fanatical, particularly for the Mosaic/Netscape/Mozilla browser. He started to investigate the phenomenon in more detail and discovered that many of Netscape's enthusiasts were actually software engineers who were fixing the product's bugs on their own and publishing the fixes or workarounds:
* in the news forums that had been set up by Netscape's technical support department to enable "self-help through collaboration" (another one of Ridlinghafer's ideas during his four-year stint at Netscape); or 
* on the unofficial "Netscape U-FAQ" website, where every known bug and feature of the browser was listed, as well as instructions regarding workarounds and fixes.

Ridlinghafer thought the company should leverage these resources and sat down and wrote out a proposal for the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program', which he presented to his manager who in turn suggested that Ridlinghafer present it at the next company executive team meeting.

At the next executive team meeting, which was attended by [[Jim Barksdale|James Barksdale]], [[Marc Andreessen]] and the VPs of every department including product engineering, each member was given a copy of the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program' proposal and Ridlinghafer was invited to present his idea to the Netscape Executive Team.

Everyone at the meeting embraced the idea except the VP of Engineering, who did not want it to go forward believing it to be a waste of time and resources. However, the VP of Engineering was overruled and Ridlinghafer was given an initial $50k budget to run with the proposal and the first official 'Bugs Bounty' program was launched in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |title=Netscape announces Netscape Bugs Bounty with release of netscape navigator 2.0 |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970501041756/http://www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |archivedate=May 1, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cobalt.io/blog/the-history-of-bug-bounty-programs|title=Cobalt Application Security Platform|website=Cobalt|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/centurylink/2015/04/30/why-companies-like-pinterest-run-bug-bounty-programs-through-the-cloud/#284751034867|title=CenturyLinkVoice: Why Companies Like Pinterest Run Bug Bounty Programs Through The Cloud|last=CenturyLink|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was such a huge success it's mentioned in many of the books detailing Netscape's successes.

== Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Violations ==

In August 2013, a Computer Science student named Khalil used an exploit to post a letter on the [[Facebook]] timeline of site founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. According to the hacker, he had tried to report the vulnerability using Facebook's bug bounty program, but because of the vague and incomplete report the response team told him that his vulnerability was not actually a bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/facebook-post-exploit-hacker-zuckerberg-621/|title=Hacker posts Facebook bug report on Zuckerberg’s wall|date=18 August 2013|publisher=RT|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "White Hat" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs]]

[[Facebook]] started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded “White Hat” debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. “Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,” Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook’s security response team, told [[CNET]] in an interview. “Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say ‘I did special work for Facebook.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitehat|first=Facebook|title=Facebook whitehat Debit card|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hands-out-white-hat-debit-cards-to-hackers/|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Facebook stopped issuing debit cards to researchers.

In 2016, ride sharing company [[Uber]] experienced a security incident when an individual accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide. The individual supposedly demanded a ransom of $100,000 in order to destroy the users’ data. In Congressional testimony, Uber CISO indicated that the company verified that the data had been destroyed before paying the $100,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7d70e53e-73e9-4336-a100-67b233084f12/75728554E990488D71625DFA69B05494.uber---john-flynn---testimony.pdf|title=Testimony of John Flynn, Chief Information Security Officer, Uber Technologies, Inc.|date=6 February 2018|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Flynn expressed regret that Uber did not disclose the incident in 2016. As part of their response to this incident, Uber worked with partner HackerOne to update their bug bounty program policies to, among other things, more thoroughly explain good faith vulnerability research and disclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://threatpost.com/uber-tightens-bug-bounty-extortion-policies/131512/|title=Uber Tightens Bug Bounty Extortion Policy|date=27 April 2018|publisher=Threat Post|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]], which has either the first or second largest number of bug hunters in the world, depending on which report one cites, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factordaily.com/india-bug-bounty-superpower/|title=Bug hunters aplenty but respect scarce for white hat hackers in India|date=8 February 2018|publisher=Factor Daily|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “India came out on top with the number of valid submissions in 2017, with the United States and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in second and third place, respectively”, Facebook quoted in a post. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo!]] was severely criticized for sending out Yahoo! T-shirts as reward to the Security Researchers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in Yahoo!, sparking what came to be called ''T-shirt-gate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=T-shirt Gate|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! T-shirt gate|url=http://www.zdnet.com/yahoo-changes-bug-bounty-policy-following-t-shirt-gate-7000021508|publisher=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-Tech Bridge]], a Geneva, Switzerland-based security testing company issued a press release saying Yahoo! offered $12.50 in credit per vulnerability, which could be used toward Yahoo-branded items such as T-shirts, cups and pens from its store. Ramses Martinez, director of Yahoo's security team claimed later in a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bug Bounty|first=Yahoo!|title=So I’m the guy who sent the t-shirt out as a thank you.|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62953984019/so-im-the-guy-who-sent-the-t-shirt-out-as-a-thank-you|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was behind the voucher reward program, and that he basically had been paying for them out of his own pocket. Eventually, Yahoo! launched its new bug bounty program on October 31 of the same year, that allows security researchers to submit bugs and receive rewards between $250 and $15,000, depending on the severity of the bug discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BugBounty Program|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! launched its Bug Bounty Program|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/65622522325/the-bug-bounty-program-is-now-live|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable programs ==

In October 2013, [[Google]] announced a major change to its Vulnerability Reward Program. Previously, it had been a bug bounty program covering many [[Google]] products. With the shift, however, the program was broadened to include a selection of high-risk [[free software]] applications and [[Library (computing)|libraries]], primarily those designed for [[Computer networking|networking]] or for low-level [[operating system]] functionality. Submissions that Google found adherent to the guidelines would be eligible for rewards ranging from $500 to $3133.70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/google-offers-leet-cash-prizes-for-updates-to-linux-and-other-os-software/|title=Google offers "leet" cash prizes for updates to Linux and other OS software|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2013/10/going-beyond-vulnerability-rewards.html|title=Going beyond vulnerability rewards|last=Zalewski|first=Michal|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Google Online Security Blog|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Google expanded their program to cover vulnerabilities found in applications developed by third parties and made available through the Google Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/22/16516670/google-play-security-rewards-program-vulnerabilities-bug-bounty/|title=Google launched a new bug bounty program to root out vulnerabilities in third-party apps on Google Play|date=22 October 2017|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Microsoft]] and [[Facebook]] partnered in November 2013 to sponsor The Internet Bug Bounty, a program to offer rewards for reporting hacks and exploits for a broad range of Internet-related software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/now-theres-a-bug-bounty-program-for-the-whole-internet/|title=Now there’s a bug bounty program for the whole Internet|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=6 November 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[GitHub]] and The [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the initiative, which is managed by volunteers from Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, and HackerOne. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/facebook-github-and-the-ford-foundation-donate-300000-to-bug-bounty-program-for-internet-infrastructure/|title=Facebook, GitHub, and the Ford Foundation donate $300,000 to bug bounty program for internet infrastructure|date=21 July 2017|publisher= VentureBeat|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software covered by the IBB includes [[Adobe Flash]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Perl]], [[OpenSSL]], [[Nginx]], [[Apache HTTP Server]], and [[Phabricator]]. In addition, the program offered rewards for broader exploits affecting widely used operating systems and [[web browser]]s, as well as the Internet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/ibb|title=The Internet Bug Bounty|publisher=HackerOne|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Peter Cook (press secretary)|Peter Cook]] announced the US federal government's first bug bounty program, the "Hack the Pentagon" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/684616/dod-invites-vetted-specialists-to-hack-the-pentagon|title=DoD Invites Vetted Specialists to ‘Hack’ the Pentagon|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program ran from April 18 to May 12 and over 1400 people submitted 138 unique valid reports through [[HackerOne]]. In total, the US [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] paid out $71,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/hackthepentagon|title=Vulnerability disclosure for Hack the Pentagon|website=HackerOne|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the Secretary of Defense, [[Ash Carter]], met with two participants, David Dworken and Craig Arendt, to honor them for their participation in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/18-year-old-hacker-honored-at-pentagon-1.415197|title=18-year-old hacker honored at Pentagon|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Open Bug Bounty]]'' is a crowd security bug bounty program established in 2014 that allows individuals to post website security vulnerabilities in the hope of a reward from affected website operators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">'''Computational chemical methods in [[solid-state physics]]''' follow the same approach as they do for molecules, but with two differences. First, the translational symmetry of the solid has to be utilised, and second, it is possible to use completely delocalised basis functions such as [[plane waves]] as an alternative to the molecular atom-centered [[basis set (chemistry)|basis functions]].  The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies, therefore they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

Calculations can use the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] method, some [[post-Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] methods, particularly [[Møller&amp;ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]] to second order (MP2) and [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">The '''dynamic method''' is a procedure for the determination of the [[mass]]es of [[asteroid]]s.  The procedure gets its name from its use of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] laws of the ''dynamics,'' or motion, of asteroids as they move around the Solar System.  The procedure works by taking multiple position measurements to determine the gravitational deflection caused when two or more asteroids move past each other.  The method relies on the fact that the large number of known asteroids means they will occasionally move past one another at very close distances.  If at least one of the two interacting bodies is large enough, its gravitational influence on the other can reveal its mass.  The accuracy of the determined mass is limited by the precision and timing of the appropriate [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations being made to determine the gravitational deflection caused by a given interaction.&lt;ref name=Kochetova-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Determination of Large Asteroid Masses by the Dynamical Method | last = Kochetova | first = O.M. | journal = Solar System Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | year = 2004 | pages = 66–75|bibcode = 2004SoSyR..38...66K |doi = 10.1023/B:SOLS.0000015157.65020.84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the method relies on detecting the amount of gravitational deflection induced during an interaction, the procedure works best for objects which will produce a large deflection in their interactions with other objects.  This means that the procedure works best for large objects, but it can also be effectively applied to objects which have repeated close interactions with each other such as when the two objects are in [[orbital resonance]] with one another.  Regardless of the mass of the interacting objects, the amount of deflection will be greater if the objects approach nearer to each other and it will also be greater if the objects pass slowly, allowing more time for gravity to perturb the orbits of the two objects.  For large enough asteroids this distance can be as large as ~0.1 AU, for less massive asteroids the conditions of the interaction would need to be correspondingly better.&lt;ref name=Kochetova-2004/&gt;

== Mathematical analysis ==
The simplest way to describe the deflection of the asteroids is in the case where one object is significantly more massive than the other.  In this case the equations of motion are the same as for that of [[Rutherford scattering]] between oppositely charged objects (so that the force is attractive rather than repulsive).  When rewritten in the more familiar notation used in celestial mechanics deflection angle can be related to the eccentricity of the hyperbolic orbit of the smaller object relative to the larger one by the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Classical Mechanics: A Modern Perspective | edition = 2nd. | last1 = Barger | first1 = Vernon D. | last2 = Olsson | first2 = Martin G. | year = 1995 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | isbn = 0-07-003734-5 | chapter = 5.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left( \frac{\Theta}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the [[asymptote]]s of the [[hyperbolic orbit]] of the small object relative to the large one, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity of this orbit (which must be greater than 1 for a hyperbolic orbit).

A more sophisticated description using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] can be achieved by separating the observed objects position on the sky as a function of time into the sum of two components: one which is a result of the relative motion of the objects themselves, and the other the motion induced by the gravitational influence of the two bodies.  The relative contributions of the two terms in the best fit of this equation onto the actual observations of the objects yields the objects masses.

'''EQOS Energie''' is a corporate group, based in [[Foetz]], [[Luxembourg]]. The company has more than 30 branches in eight countries. EQOS Energie specialises in railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services.

Until August 2014, the company operated under the name ALPINE-ENERGIE.&lt;ref name="new owner"&gt;[http://www.triton-partners.com/media/archive/triton-new-owner-of-alpine-energie/ „Triton new owner of ALPINE-ENERGIE“], Press release from Triton. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  EQOS is an [[acronym]] that stands for '''Excellent Quality Of Services''', and represents the brand promise.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE"&gt;[http://www.eqos-energie.com/en/company/germany „EQOS Energie in Germany“], EQOS Energie. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
EQOS Energie is owned by the European investment company Triton.

== History ==
Founded as "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen mbH" in [[Stuttgart]] by Wilhelm Blättchen in 1920, EQOS Energie has a nearly hundred-year-old company history.&lt;ref name="„Hist“"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=64784199 „Construction and Engineering: Company Overview of EQOS Energie Holding S.à r.l.“], Bloomberg. Retrieved November 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the business segment was constituted by electrical and industrial enterprises.
In 1978, the subsidiary "ENERGIE Lignes Hautes Tension" was founded in [[Luxembourg]]. 15 years later, the first working group (ARGE) combined their operations with the Austrian “ALPINE Bau GmbH" in a joint venture. In connection with ARGE, a 380-kV forwarding line was set up for the Austrian composite company as were the first steel towers for mobile radio networks. This resulted in the foundation of "ALPINE-ENERGIE Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen GmbH", which is headquartered in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. Due to the foundation of "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für Leitungsbau und Kommunikationstechnik AG" in [[Berne]], the company expanded its business into [[Switzerland]]. Entry into the rail sector was marked by "ALPINE ENERGIE’s" launch in the catenary building sector at the Austrian [[St. Valentin]] main railway station in 1999. As a result, the catenary lines there were modernised. Three years later, the ALPINE Group took over the shares owned by Blättchen. While founding the "ALPINE-ENERGIE Holding AG" and "ALPINE-ENERGIE Deutschland GmbH", the business expanded and the company grew quickly.

In 2006, the Spanish building group [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas|Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC)]] became majority shareholder of the ALPINE Group. In the same year, "SAG Kommunikationstechnik" was taken over. Through its acquisition of "SAG Kommunikationstechnik", the company extended its business in Switzerland and Austria. Between 2009 and 2011, "ALPINE-ENERGIE" companies were founded in [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="„Hist“"/&gt;

In 2013, the FCC assumed ownership of ALPINE-ENERGIE, which became a subsidiary of FCC. Subsequently, the company was taken over by [[Triton Fonds]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Since then, the long-established group member has conducted its business under the name of '''EQOS Energie'''.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Following the turnaround, as one of the industry’s foremost suppliers, the company realigned its business model in 2015 to address growing market requirements. In a management buy-out, EQOS Energie retired in 2016 from the Swiss market and focused in all service areas on its eight core markets: [[Germany]], Austria, Luxembourg, [[France]], [[Belgium]], Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

== Business Sector ==
EQOS Energie provides its customers with a wide range of solutions in five business sectors: railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services. Its range of activities include consulting, planning and construction as well as maintenance and optimisation. In addition to complete projects the company also offers individual services for various project stages.

Concerning railway technology, EQOS Energie is specialised in the construction of catenary lines, signalling technology and technical equipment in the local and long-distance transport sector. 
The construction of switchgear and substations is the key expertise of the energy technology division. In the production and manufacturing processes, EQOS Energie plans, delivers, installs and maintains all technical facilities. Also, the company offers solutions in the areas of transport and lighting technology in Austria. Given changes in energy policy, EQOS Energie has taken over new construction and increased high-voltage network construction.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE" /&gt; As a nationwide full-service provider, EQOS Energie plans, constructs and maintains mobile communications and fixed networks.
EQOS Energie focuses on technical equipment for buildings and the public sector in Poland and the Czech Republic. The spectrum of services extends from acquisition and construction to maintenance, modernisation and repair of commercial real estate and industrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finyear.com/Dr-Helmut-Steurer-is-new-CFO-of-EQOS-Energie-Holding_a36204.html "The Management Board of EQOS Energie now consists of Eric Mendel and Dr. Helmut Steurer"], financial and innovation all the year.

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].

*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;&lt;!--Sources some but not all of this list, especially many of the dates and places.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8430">'''Handling qualities''' is one of the two principal regimes in the science of [[flight test]] (the other being performance). Handling qualities involves the study and evaluation of the stability and control characteristics of an aircraft. They have a critical bearing on the safety of flight and on the ease of controlling an airplane in steady flight and in maneuvers.

==Relation to stability==
To understand the discipline of handling qualities, the concept of stability should be understood. Stability can be defined only when the vehicle is in trim; that is, there are no unbalanced forces or moments acting on the vehicle to cause it to deviate from steady flight. If this condition exists, and if the vehicle is disturbed, stability refers to the tendency of the vehicle to return to the trimmed condition. If the vehicle initially tends to return to a trimmed condition, it is said to be statically stable. If it continues to approach the trimmed condition without overshooting, the motion is called a subsidence. If the motion causes the vehicle to overshoot the trimmed condition, it may oscillate back and forth. If this oscillation damps out, the motion is called a damped oscillation and the vehicle is said to be dynamically stable. On the other hand, if the motion increases in amplitude, the vehicle is said to be dynamically unstable.

The theory of stability of airplanes was worked out by G. H. Bryan in [[England]] in 1904. This theory is essentially equivalent to the theory taught to aeronautical students today and was a remarkable intellectual achievement considering that at the time Bryan developed the theory, he had not even heard of the Wright brothers' first flight. Because of the complication of the theory and the tedious computations required in its use, it was rarely applied by airplane designers. Obviously, to fly successfully, pilotless airplanes had to be dynamically stable. The airplane flown by the Wright brothers, and most airplanes flown thereafter, were not stable, but by trial and error, designers developed a few planes that had satisfactory flying qualities. Many other airplanes, however, had poor flying qualities, which sometimes resulted in crashes.

==Historical development==
Bryan showed that the stability characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, which means that the airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the [[phugoid]] oscillation, usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short-period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch roll mode.

Some early airplane designers attempted to make airplanes that were dynamically stable, but it was found that the requirements for stability conflicted with those for satisfactory flying qualities. Meanwhile, no information was available to guide the designer as to just what characteristics should be incorporated to provide satisfactory flying qualities.

By the 1930s, there was a general feeling that airplanes should be dynamically stable, but some aeronautical engineers were starting to recognize the conflict between the requirements for stability and flying qualities. To resolve this question, Edward Warner, who was working as a consultant to the Douglas Aircraft Company on the design of the DC-4, a large four-engine transport airplane, made the first effort in the United States to write a set of requirements for satisfactory flying qualities. Dr. Warner, a member of the main committee of the [[NACA]], also requested that a flight study be made to determine the flying qualities of an airplane along the lines of the suggested requirements. This study was conducted by [[Hartley A. Soulé]] of Langley. Entitled ''Preliminary Investigation of the Flying Qualities of Airplanes'', Soulé's report showed several areas in which the suggested requirements needed revision and showed the need for more research on other types of airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-ctX2Q-CSIC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Floyd+L.+Thompson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fkprTOStEoH6lwethskX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Floyd%20L.%20Thompson&amp;f=false| title=Airplane stability and control: a history of the technologies that made aviation possible| authors=Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2002| isbn= 978-0-521-80992-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a program was started by [[Robert R. Gilruth]] with [[Melvin N. Gough]] as the chief test pilot.

==Evaluation of handling qualities==
The technique for the study of flying qualities requirements used by Gilruth was first to install instruments to record relevant quantities such as control positions and forces, airplane angular velocities, linear accelerations, airspeed, and altitude. Then a program of specified flight conditions and maneuvers was flown by an experienced test pilot. After the flight, data were transcribed from the records and the results were correlated with pilot opinion. This approach would be considered routine today, but it was a notable original contribution by Gilruth that took advantage of the flight recording instruments already available at Langley and the variety of airplanes available for tests under comparable conditions.

An important quantity in handling qualities measurements in turns or pull-ups is the variation of control force on the control stick or wheel with the value of acceleration normal to the flight direction expressed in g units. This quantity is usually called the force per g.

==Relation to Spacecraft==
Handling qualities are those characteristics of a flight vehicle that govern the ease and precision with which a pilot is able to perform a flying task.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, G.E. and Harper, R.P., “The Use of Pilot Rating in the Evaluation of Aircraft Handling Qualities,” NASA TN D-5153, April 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  The way in which particular vehicle factors affect handling qualities has been studied in aircraft for decades,&lt;ref&gt; Gilruth, R.R., “Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of Airplanes,” NACA TR 755, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; and reference standards for the handling qualities of both fixed-wing aircraft&lt;ref&gt; “Military Standard, Flying Qualities of Piloted Airplanes,” MIL-STD-1797, March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and rotary-wing aircraft&lt;ref&gt;Aeronautical Design Standard, Performance Specification: Handling Qualities Requirements for Military Rotorcraft,” ADS-33, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed and are now in common use. These standards define a subset of the dynamics and control design space that provides good handling qualities for a given vehicle type and flying task.  A new generation of spacecraft now under development by NASA to replace the Space Shuttle and return astronauts to the Moon will have a manual control capability for several mission tasks, and the ease and precision with which pilots can execute these tasks will have an important effect on performance, mission risk and training costs. No reference standards currently exist for handling qualities of piloted spacecraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">'''Force lines''' method is used in [[Solid Mechanics]] for visualization of internal forces in a deformed body. A force line represents graphically the internal force acting within a body across imaginary internal surfaces. The force lines show the maximal internal forces and their directions.

== Force lines drawing ==
The procedure for determining the force lines consists of two stages:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ict.nsc.ru/ws/NikNik/2083/rep2083.pdf Kokcharov I.I., Burov A.E. Analysis of stress state with the force lines method. Proceedings of International Conference RDAMM 2001, Vol. 6, Pt 2, Special Issue.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I.I., Burov A.E. Force lines drawing for a deformed body. Analysis of solutions for plate with hole or crack. Preprint Computer Center of RAS, Krasnoyarsk, No. 6, 1991 (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;
  
1) Defining the internal surface. The surface is perpendicular to maximum principal [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] in every point of the solid.
 
2) Integration of internal stresses on the surface. Stress is a measure of the average amount of force exerted per unit area. The stress distribution can be obtained from known theoretical&lt;ref&gt;Timoshenko S.P., Goodier J.N. Theory of elasticity. McGraw-Hill, New-York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; or numerical ([[Finite element method]]) analysis.

The researcher who builds up the force lines can choose a magnitude of the internal force and the initial border where the drawing procedure starts.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image: CrackForceLines.gif| Figure 2. Force lines in a plate with a central crack.
Image: BendingForceLines.gif| Figure 3. Force lines in a beam under pure bending.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Figure 1 shows an example of force lines in a body with a hole under tension. The force lines are denser near the hole. The visualization helps to explain the [[stress concentration]].

Figure 2 shows the force lines in a body with a crack. The cracks are the most dangerous stress concentrator: the intensity of the force lines is high in the crack tip (see [[Fracture mechanics]]).

Figure 3 shows the case of pure [[bending]] of a beam with rectangular cross section. There are no internal forces at the neutral axis of the beam. The tensile and compressive force lines are symmetrical and are denser at the beam’s edge.

== Application ==
[[File:StructureForceLines.gif|thumb|right|Figure 4. Force lines analysis helps to optimize the structure of a steel crane balancer (figure shows 1/4 of the structure.)]]

The force lines pictures are used for

1) Analysis of stress concentration (Figure1 and Figure 2): the number of the force lines increases in areas with stress concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ch/books?id=GQYmOn9SKcsC Milton Ohring. Engineering Materials Science.  Academic Press, 1995] {{ISBN|0-12-524995-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Optimization of structures: reinforcing the structure in the areas with concentration of force lines and deleting the components where there are no force lines.

Figure 4 shows 2 examples of old and new structures. The force lines distribution is more efficient for the second case. 
The visualization of force lines is a qualitative method, which is used as a supplementary method to the [[stress analysis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''fuzzy finite element''' method combines the well-established [[finite element method]] with the concept of [[fuzzy number]]s, the latter being a special case of a [[fuzzy set]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of using [[fuzzy number]]s instead of [[real numbers]] lies in the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] (on material properties, parameters, geometry, initial conditions, etc.) in the finite element analysis. 

One way to establish a fuzzy finite element (FE) analysis is to use existing FE software (in-house or commercial) as an inner-level module to compute a [[deterministic]] result, and to add an outer-level loop to handle the fuzziness (uncertainty). This outer-level loop comes down to solving an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem. If the inner-level deterministic module produces [[monotonic]] behavior with respect to the input variables, then the outer-level optimization problem is greatly simplified, since in this case the [[Maxima and minima|extrema]] will be located at the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]].

Parabolic Equation

Traditional finite element method is a well-established method to solve various problems of science and engineering. Different authors have used various methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction problem. In this study, heat conduction in a circular rod has been considered which is made up of two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In earlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as fixed numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in general by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are actually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and in that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be considered in the analysis.Hence interval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the finite element method to solve a steady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element method in the said problem gives fuzzy system of linear equations in general. Here we have also proposed new methods to handle such type of fuzzy system of linear equations. Corresponding results are computed and has been reported here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarangam Majumdar]], 2012. ''Fuzzy Finite Element Method for One-dimensional Steady State Heat Conduction Problem''. Thesis, &lt;/ref&gt;

'''HeHalutz''' or '''Hechalutz ''' ({{lang-he-n|החלוץ}}, ''lit.'' The Pioneer) was a Jewish youth movement that trained young people for agricultural settlement in the [[Land of Israel]]. It became an umbrella organization of the pioneering [[Zionist youth movement]]s.

==History==
HeHalutz was founded by Eliezer Joffe in America in 1905, and about the same time in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ritov | first1 = Israel | first2 = Yehuda | last2 = Slutsky | chapter = He-Ḥalutz | title = Encyclopaedia Judaica | editor = Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik | edition = 2 | volume = 8 | place = Detroit | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | year = 2007 | pages = 756–761 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587508655&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=imcpl1111&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=377191611c4ffc8f4281aa4d532302f7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], HeHalutz branches opened across Europe (including Russia), America and Canada. Leaders of the organization included [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] (later the second president of the [[State of Israel]]),  and [[David Ben-Gurion]] (later  the first Prime Minister of Israel) in America, and [[Joseph Trumpeldor]] in Russia.

Ben-Gurion was living in [[Jerusalem]] at the start of the First World War, where he and Ben Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army. Despite this, he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, where he remained for three years. On his arrival, he and Ben Zvi went on a tour of 35 cities in an attempt to raise a Hechalutz "pioneer army" of 10,000 men to fight on Turkey's side.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, Shabtai (1985) ''Ben-Gurion and the Palestinian Arabs. From Peace to War.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-503562-3}}. pp. 25, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of November 1917, the situation changed dramatically and Ben-Gurion, with the interest of Zionism in mind, switched sides and joined the newly formed [[Jewish Legion]] of the [[British Army]], leaving to fight the Turks in Palestine.

At its peak, between 1930 and 1935, HeHalutz operated in 25 countries throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Northern South America. In 1932-1934, [[Golda Meir]], later the prime minister of Israel, was the secretary of the women's chapter of HeHalutz in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishdestiny.com/destinys-projects/faith-fate/a-new-beginning/biographies/golda-meir/ Golda Meir]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932,  the organization established headquarters in New York and twenty branches in cities and towns throughout the United States and Canada. Farms were then established to train members for agricultural work in Palestine. Such farms operated in Creamridge, New Jersey, Heightstown, New Jersey, Poughkeepsie, New York, Smithville, Ontario., and Colton, California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08655.html Jewish Virtual Library: HeHalutz]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1933, after Jews were expelled from the workforce in Nazi Germany, HeHalutz farms became the primary framework for vocational training and preparation for emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=eKwyyGrTSvAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=hehalutz+farms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OsPHXXeAW8&amp;sig=7D0044HkPtIwcfhXPXci-lzAF50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKmfn5xMzUAhXFXhoKHfnuAsMQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hehalutz%20farms&amp;f=true Before Catastrophe: The Distinctive Path of German Zionism, Hagit Lavsky]&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the eve of [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, HeHalutz numbered 100,000 members worldwide, with approximately 60,000 having already emigrated (''[[aliyah]]'') to [[Mandate Palestine]], and with 16,000 members in training centers (''[[Hakhshara|hakhsharot]]'') for the pioneering life in the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007240 Resistance in the Smaller Ghettos of Eastern Europe] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt; During the war and German occupation, Jews in some ghettos in Europe established Hechalutz units, as in Lithuania's [[Šiauliai Ghetto]].&lt;ref name=ALJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lithuanianjews.org.il/htmls/article_list4.aspx?C2014=14288&amp;BSP=14059&amp;BSS59=14055 |title=The Shavli Ghetto |publisher=Association of Lithuanian Jews in Israel |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950's HeHalutz"... was absorbed by [[Hashomer Hatzair]], which had always maintained a large degree of autonomy.

The '''hydroxyl radical''', '''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH''', is the neutral form of the [[hydroxide]] ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive (easily becoming [[hydroxyl]] groups) and consequently short-lived; however, they form an important part of [[radical (chemistry)|radical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayyan M., Hashim M.A., AlNashef I.M. | year = 2016 | title = Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications | url = | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 3029–3085 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably hydroxyl radicals are produced from the decomposition of [[organic peroxide|hydroperoxides]] (ROOH) or, in [[atmospheric chemistry]], by the reaction of [[excited state|excited]] [[atomic oxygen]] with water. It is also an important radical formed in radiation chemistry, since it leads to the formation of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]], which can enhance [[corrosion]] and [[stress corrosion cracking|SCC]] in coolant systems subjected to radioactive environments. Hydroxyl radicals are also produced during UV-light dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (suggested in 1879) and likely in [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]], where trace amounts of reduced transition metals catalyze peroxide-mediated oxidations of organic compounds.

In [[organic synthesis]], hydroxyl radicals are most commonly generated by [[photolysis]] of [[1-Hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione|1-hydroxy-2(1''H'')-pyridinethione]].

The hydroxyl radical is often referred to as the "detergent" of the [[troposphere]] because it reacts with many pollutants, decomposing them through "[[cracking (chemistry)#Chemistry|cracking]]", often acting as the first step to their removal. It also has an important role in eliminating some [[greenhouse gas]]es like [[methane]] and [[ozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[IPCC]] |title=Trends in the Hydroxyl Free Radical |quote=The hydroxyl free radical (OH) is the major oxidizing chemical in the atmosphere, destroying about 3.7 Gt of trace gases, including CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and all HFCs and HCFCs, each year (Ehhalt, 1999). |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |number=IPCC AR4 WG1 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reaction with the hydroxyl radical often determines how long many pollutants last in the atmosphere, if they do not undergo [[photolysis]] or are rained out. For instance methane, which reacts relatively slowly with hydroxyl radical, has an average lifetime of &gt;5 years and many [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s have lifetimes of 50 years or more. Other pollutants, such as larger [[hydrocarbons]], can have very short average lifetimes of less than a few hours.

The first reaction with many [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) is the removal of a [[hydrogen]] atom, forming water and an [[alkyl]] radical (R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;).
:&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + RH → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;
The alkyl radical will typically react rapidly with [[oxygen]] forming a [[peroxy]] radical.

:R&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RO{{su|b=2|p=•}}

The fate of this radical in the [[troposphere]] is dependent on factors such as the amount of sunlight, pollution in the atmosphere and the nature of the [[alkyl]] radical that formed it.&lt;ref&gt;(See chapters 12 &amp; 13 in External Links "University Lecture notes on Atmospheric chemistry)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological significance==
Hydroxyl radicals can occasionally be produced as a byproduct of [[immune system|immune action]]. [[Macrophages]] and [[microglia]] most frequently generate this compound when exposed to very specific [[pathogens]], such as certain bacteria. The destructive action of hydroxyl radicals has been implicated in several [[neurological]] [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]] such as [[HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder|HAND]] when immune cells become over-activated and toxic to neighboring healthy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kincaid-Colton|first=Carol|author2=Wolfgang Streit|title=The Brain's Immune System|journal=Scientific American|date=November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydroxyl radical can damage virtually all types of macromolecules: carbohydrates, nucleic acids ([[mutation]]s), lipids ([[lipid peroxidation]]), and amino acids (e.g. conversion of [[Phenylalanine|Phe]] to ''m''-[[Tyrosine]] and ''o''-[[Tyrosine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|7776173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroxyl radical has a very short ''[[in vivo]]'' [[half-life]] of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and a high reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Importance in Earth's atmosphere==
The hydroxyl &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radical is one of the main chemical species controlling the oxidizing capacity of the global Earth atmosphere. This oxidizing reactive species has a major impact on the concentrations and distribution of greenhouse gases and pollutants in the Earth atmosphere. It is the most widespread oxidizer in the [[troposphere]], the lowest part of the atmosphere. Understanding &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH variability is important to evaluating human impacts on the atmosphere and climate. The &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH species has a lifetime in the Earth atmosphere of less than one second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This small variability is consistent with measurements of [[methane]] and other trace gases primarily oxidized by &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, as well as global photochemical model calculations.

In 2014, researchers reported their discovery of a "hole" or absence of hydroxyl throughout the entire depth of the [[troposphere]] across a large region of the tropical West Pacific. They suggested that this hole is permitting large quantities of [[ozone]]-degrading chemicals to reach the [[stratosphere]], and that this may be significantly reinforcing ozone depletion in the polar regions with potential consequences for the climate of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;["Like a giant elevator to the stratosphere", ''News Release'', Alfred Wegener Institute, April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy levels===
&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is a diatomic molecule. The electronic angular momentum along the molecular axis is +1 or −1, and the electronic spin angular momentum ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{1/2}}. Because of the orbit-spin coupling, the spin angular momentum can be oriented in parallel or anti arallel directions to the orbital angular momentum, producing the splitting into Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; and Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; states. The &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; ground state of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is split by lambda doubling interaction (an interaction between the nuclei rotation and the unpaired electron motion around its orbit). Hyperfine interaction with the unpaired spin of the proton further splits the levels.

===Chemistry of the molecule &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH===
In order to study gas phase interstellar chemistry, it is convenient to distinguish two types of interstellar clouds: diffuse clouds, with {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;= 30–100&amp;nbsp;K}} and {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10–1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and dense clouds, with {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;= 10–30&amp;nbsp;K}} and density {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|e=4}}–{{val|e=3|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. Ion chemical routes in both dense and diffuse clouds have been established for some works (Hartquist, ''Molecular Astrophysics'', 1990).

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH production pathways====
The &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radical is linked with the production of H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in molecular clouds. Studies of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH distribution in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1)&lt;ref name="HarjuWinnberg2000"&gt;{{citation |title=The distribution of OH in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 |bibcode=2000A&amp;A...353.1065H |last1=Harju |first1=J. |last2=Winnberg |first2=A. |last3=Wouterloot |first3=J. G. A. |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that in dense gas, &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is mainly formed by dissociative recombination of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Dissociative recombination is the reaction in which a molecular ion recombines with an electron and dissociates into neutral fragments. Important formation mechanisms for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH are:

{{NumBlk|:| H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|Dissociative recombination:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|1a}}}}

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH destruction pathways====
Experimental data on association reactions of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH suggest that radiative association involving atomic and diatomic neutral radicals may be considered as an effective mechanism for the production of small neutral molecules in the interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name="FieldAdams1980"&gt;{{citation |title=Molecular synthesis in interstellar clouds - The radiative association reaction H + OH yields H2O + h/nu/ |bibcode=1980MNRAS.192....1F |last1=Field |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=N. G. |last3=Smith |first3=D. |year=1980|doi=10.1093/mnras/192.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in the gas phase via the neutral exchange reaction between O and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, which is also the main sink for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH in dense regions.&lt;ref name="HarjuWinnberg2000" /&gt;

We can see that atomic oxygen takes part both in the production and destruction of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH, so the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH depends mainly on the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; abundance. Then, important chemical pathways leading from &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH radicals are:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Neutral–neutral:{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|1A}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;H|Ion–neutral{{spaces|10}} {{EquationRef|2A}}}}

====Rate constants and relative rates for important formation and destruction mechanisms====
Rate constants can be derived from the dataset published in a website.&lt;ref&gt;http://udfa.net&lt;/ref&gt; Rate constants have the form:

:{{math|''k''(''T'') {{=}} ''α''({{sfrac|''T''|300}})&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; × exp(−{{sfrac|''γ''|''T''}}) cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

The following table has the rate constants calculated for a typical temperature in a dense cloud {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K}}.
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Reaction
! {{math|1=''k'' (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K) cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

|-
| {{EquationNote|3A}}

|-
| {{EquationNote|4A}}

|-
| {{EquationNote|5A}}
| 3.33&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Formation rates ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained using the rate constants ''k''(''T'') and the abundances of the reactants species C and D:

:{{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k''(''T'')&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt;[C][D]}}

where [Y] represents the abundance of the species Y. In this approach, abundances were taken from ''The UMIST database for astrochemistry 2006'', and the values are relatives to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; density. Following table shows the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; in order to get a view of the most important reactions.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

| 0.035
| 3.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;
| 0.679
|}

The results suggest that (1a) reaction is the most prominent reaction in dense clouds. It is in concordance with Harju et al. 2000.

The next table shows the results by doing the same procedure for destruction reaction:

| 4.29&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Results shows that reaction 1A is the main sink for &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH in dense clouds.

===Importance of interstellar &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH observations===
Discoveries of the microwave spectra of a considerable number of molecules prove the existence of rather complex molecules in the interstellar clouds, and provides the possibility to study dense clouds, which are obscured by the dust they contain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Rank, D. M. |author2=Townes, C. H. |author3=Welch, W. J. | title=Interstellar Molecules and Dense Clouds

| pmid=17779392 |bibcode = 1971Sci...174.1083R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH molecule has been observed in the interstellar medium since 1963 through its 18-cm transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dieter, N. H. |author2=Ewen, H. I. |title=Radio Observations of the Interstellar HO Line at 1,667 Mc/s

| accessdate=2009-01-13 |bibcode = 1964Natur.201..279D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH was observed by its rotational transitions at far infrared wavelengths, mainly in the Orion region. Because each rotational level of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH is split in by lambda doubling, astronomers can observe a wide variety of energy states from the ground state.

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH as a tracer of shock conditions====
Very high densities are required to thermalize the rotational transitions of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Storey, J. W. V. |author2=Watson, D. M. |author3=Townes, C. H. | title=Detection of interstellar HO in the far-infrared
| journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters
| volume=244 |date=1981-02-15 |pages=L27–L30 |doi=10.1086/183472
| bibcode=1981ApJ...244L..27S }}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is difficult to detect far-infrared emission lines from a quiescent molecular cloud. Even at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; densities of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, dust must be optically thick at infrared wavelengths. But the passage of a shock wave through a molecular cloud is precisely the process which can bring the molecular gas out of equilibrium with the dust, making observations of far-infrared emission lines possible. A moderately fast shock may produce a transient raise in the &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH abundance relative to hydrogen. So, it is possible that far-infrared emission lines of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH can be a good diagnostic of shock conditions.

====In diffuse clouds====
Diffuse clouds are of astronomical interest because they play a primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21&amp;nbsp;cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when they are directed at low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: the thermal width of the hydrogen lines are of the same order as the internal velocities of structures of interest, so cloud components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. Molecular line observations in principle do not suffer from this problem. Unlike HI, molecules generally have [[excitation temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt;, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH are the most easily studied candidate molecules. CO has transitions in a region of the spectrum (wavelength &lt;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;mm) where there are not strong background continuum sources, but &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH has the 18&amp;nbsp;cm emission, line convenient for absorption observations.&lt;ref name="DickeyCrovisier1981"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Dickey, J. M. |author2=Crovisier, J. |author3=Kazes, I. | title=Emission-absorption observations of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HO in diffuse interstellar clouds |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics
| volume=98 |issue=2 |date=May 1981 |pages=271–285 |bibcode=1981A&amp;A....98..271D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation studies provide the most sensitive means of detections of molecules with subthermal excitation, and can give the opacity of the spectral line, which is a central issue to model the molecular region.

Studies based in the kinematic comparison of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH and HI absorption lines from diffuse clouds are useful in determining their physical conditions, specially because heavier elements provide higher velocity resolution.

====&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers====
&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH [[maser]]s, a type of [[astrophysical maser]], were the first masers to be discovered in space and have been observed in more environments than any other type of maser.

In the [[Milky Way]], &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers are found in stellar masers (evolved stars), interstellar masers (regions of massive star formation), or in the interface between supernova remnants and molecular material. Interstellar &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers are often observed from molecular material surrounding ultracompact [[H II region|H&amp;nbsp;II region]]s (UC H&amp;nbsp;II). But there are masers associated with very young stars that have yet to create UC H&amp;nbsp;II regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Argon, Alice L. |author2=Reid, Mark J. |author3=Menten, Karl M. | title=A class of interstellar &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HO masers associated with protostellar outflows
| date=August 2003 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal
| volume=593 |issue=2 |pages=925–930 |doi=10.1086/376592
| bibcode=2003ApJ...593..925A |arxiv = astro-ph/0304565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This class of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers appears to form near the edges of very dense material, place where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O masers form, and where total densities drop rapidly and UV radiation form young stars can dissociate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. So, observations of &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH masers in these regions, can be an important way to probe the distribution of the important H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule in interstellar shocks at high spatial resolutions.

====Application in water purification====
Hydroxyl radicals play a key role in the oxidative destruction of organic pollutant using a series of methodologies collectively known as [[advanced oxidation process]]es (AOPs). The destruction of pollutants in AOPs is based on the non-selective reaction of hydroxyl radicals on organic compounds. It is highly effective against a series of pollutants including [[pesticides]], pharmaceutical compounds, [[dyes]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunil Paul|first=M.

The '''Institute of Space Propulsion''' in [[Lampoldshausen]] is one of the eight research centers of the [[German Aerospace Center|German Aerospace Center (DLR)]].

Approximately 220 people work there in the fields of research and tests of [[rocket engine]]s. The main purpose of the facility is the operation of test stands for space propulsion on behalf of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] and in cooperation with the European space industry.

== Test stands ==
The facility has a surface area of approximately 35 ha, on which are seven test stands.

=== Test stand P1 ===
At the altitude test stand P1 are tested small engines with a thrust up to 600 N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dlr.de/ra/Portaldata/55/Resources/dokumente/StatusReport_Teil_1_lowres_Gesamt.pdf|title = Lampoldshausen status report 2011|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, thrusters for [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control Systems (RCS)]] and [[Apogee kick motor|Apogee Kick Motors (AKM)]] fall in this category.

=== Test stand P2 ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 1.jpg|thumb|Test stand P2]]
The test stand P2 is used for testing [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]] engines with a thrust up to 100&amp;nbsp;kN under ground conditions.

=== Test stand P3 ===
The test stand P3 is a component test stand for [[Cryogenic fuel|cryogenic]] propellants. It was set up mainly for the development and tests of [[combustion chamber]]s, in particular those of the [[Vulcain|Vulcain 1]] and [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] engines for the European launcher [[Ariane 5]].

=== Test stand P4 (P4.1 / P4.2) ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 2.jpg|thumb|Test stand P4]]
The vacuum test stand P4 is composed of two test stands P4.1 and P4.2. Tests with the [[Aestus]] engine can be carried out at the P4.2 test stand, whereas the test stand P4.1 has been used for the [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] upper stage engine.

=== Test stand P5 ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 3.jpg|thumb|Test stand P5]]
The test stand P5 has been used for the development and the qualification of the Vulcain and Vulcain 2 engines. Today, it is mainly used to test engines in the frame of the ESA ARTA program.

=== Test stand P6 ===
The test stand P6 is an altitude test stand for [[cold gas thruster]]s.

=== Test stand P8 ===
In the frame of a German-French cooperation arose the idea to build a common ''European Research and Technology test stand'' P8. The partners [[Snecma|SNECMA]], [[Astrium]], [[CNES]] and [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] made a start on this project in 1992. The main purpose of this test stand is the research about high pressure combustion of hydrogen and oxygen.

'''Intercultural competence''' is a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioural skills that lead to effective and appropriate
[[communication]]  with people of other [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal.

''Health &amp; Social Care In The Community'', ''24''(6), e117-e130. doi:10.1111/hsc.12293&lt;/ref&gt; Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lustig, M. W., &amp; Koester, J. (2003). ''Intercultural competence: Interpersonal communication across cultures'' (4th ed.). Boston : Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Basics==
It's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liu, S. (2014) that allow a person understand another person from another culture. Becoming intercultural: exposure to foreign cultures and intercultural competence through [[travel]] and [[tourism]]. ''China Media Research'', ''10''(3), 7+. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015).

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015). When an Intercultural Business Negotiation Fails: Comparing the Emotions and Behavioural Tendencies of Individualistic and Collectivistic Negotiators. ''Group Decision &amp; Negotiation'', ''24''(3), 537-561. doi:10.1007/s10726-014-9420-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maali, B. M., &amp; Al-Attar, A. (2017).

** Decisions are based on the benefits of the group rather than the individual;
** Strong loyalty to the group as the main social unit;
** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Cultures value tradition, personal stability, maintaining "face," and reciprocity during interpersonal interactions;
** People expect quick results after actions;
** Historical events and beliefs influence people's actions in the present;
** Monochronic cultures are Canada, Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, and U.S.A.
* Long-term or Polychronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
** Cultures value persistence, thriftiness,and humility;
** People sacrifice immediate gratification for long-term commitments;
** Cultures believe that past results do not guarantee for the future and are aware of change;
** Polychronic cultures are China, Japan, Brazil, and India.

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;
* the [http://idiinventory.com/ Inter-cultural Intercultural Developmental Inventory]
* the [[Cultural Intelligence]] (CQ) Measurement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cq-portal.com/index.php|title=Cultural Intelligence Portal|website=www.cq-portal.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [http://www.tamas.com/index.php?q=node/21 Multicultural Personality Questionnaire]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halim|first=Haslina|last2=Bakar|first2=Hassan Abu|last3=Mohamad|first3=Bahtiar|date=2014-11-06|title=Expatriate Adjustment: Validating Multicultural Personality Trait among Self-initiated Academic Expatriates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814057334|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|series=The International Conference on Communication and Media 2014 (i-COME’14) - Communication, Empowerment and Governance: The 21st Century Enigma|volume=155|pages=123–129|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.10.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004). Studying abroad: the role of college students' goals on the development of cross-cultural skills and global understanding. ''College Student Journal'', 38(3). Retrieved July 9, 2007, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lessard-Clouston |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Towards an understanding of culture in L2/FL education |journal=Ronko: K.G. studies in English |volume=25 |pages=131–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lievens |first=F. |last2=Harris |first2=M. |last3=Van Keer |first3=E. |last4=Bisqueret |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Predicting cross-cultural training performance: The validity of personality, cognitive ability, and dimensions measured by an assessment center and a behavior description interview |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=476–489 |pmid=12814296 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B.

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012). ''The ICCA™ Facilitator's Manual'' London: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is The ICCA?|url=http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx|work=Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal|publisher=GloBus Research Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

'''Islamic ethics''' (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as "good character," historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the [[Qur'an]]ic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], the [[precedent]]s of [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] (see [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]]), the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab]]ian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including [[Persia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally [[Islam]]ic structure.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; Although Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and [[Hadith]] in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundational motives==
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: [[Allah]]), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to "command the good and forbid the [[evil]]" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Becker|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "heedlessness."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;
Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Masculine|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of [[justice]]. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

==Moral commandments==

In the 17th chapter, "Al-Israa" ("The Night Journey"), verses {{Quran-usc-range|17|22|39}}, the [[Qur'an]] provides a set of moral stipulations which are "among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at [[University of Toronto|the University of Toronto]], these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and "represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations.  
# '''Worship only God:''' Do not make with Allah another god; lest you will sit disgraced and forsaken. ({{cite quran|17|22|style=ref}})
# '''Be kind, honourable and humble to one's parents:''' And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him alone, and to be good to the parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], a word of disrespect, and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}}) And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small." ({{cite quran|17|24|style=ref}})
# '''Be neither miserly nor wasteful in one's expenditure:''' And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. ({{cite quran|17|26|style=ref}}) Indeed, the spendthrifts are brothers of the devil, and the devil is, to his lord, ungrateful. ({{cite quran|17|27|style=ref}}) And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. ({{cite quran|17|28|style=ref}}) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it to its utmost reach, so that you [thereby] become blamed and insolvent. ({{cite quran|17|29|style=ref}})
# '''Do not engage in 'mercy killings' for fear of starvation:''' And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin. ({{cite quran|17|31|style=ref}})
# '''Do not commit adultery:''' And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is an immorality and an evil way. ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# '''Do not kill unjustly:''' And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law]. ({{cite quran|17|33|style=ref}})
# '''Care for orphaned children:''' And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity...({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Keep one's promises:''' ...fulfill (every) engagement [i.e. promise/covenant], for (every) engagement will be questioned (on the Day of Reckoning). ({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Be honest and fair in one's interactions:''' And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is the best [way] and best in result. ({{cite quran|17|35|style=ref}})
# '''Do not be arrogant in one's claims or beliefs:''' And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - all those will be questioned. ({{cite quran|17|36|style=ref}}) And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height. ({{cite quran|17|37|style=ref}})

Many Muslim theologians see the [[Golden rule#Islam|'''Golden Rule''']] implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the [[Hadith]]. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PWR|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reforms under Islam==
{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}

Many reforms in human rights took place under [[Islam]] between 610 and 661, including the period of [[Muhammad]]'s  mission and the rule of the [[Rashidun|four immediate successors]] who established the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]]. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1998), p.452&lt;/ref&gt; and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, [[slavery]], and the rights of women and [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] improved on what was present in existing [[Arab]] society at the time.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected [[hierarchy]], and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; [[John Esposito]] sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as [[female infanticide]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the poor, [[usury]], murder, false contracts, and theft.&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam "represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the [[Greco-Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|ancient Persian]] world."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the ''Charter of Medina'', was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1964|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution established the security of the community, [[freedom of religion]], the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the [[Women's rights|security of women]], stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|blood-wite]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to [[Prisoners of war|captives]], regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. "One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances," Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was "enormously improved": the Arabian slave "was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a [[social status]] and with certain quasi-legal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esposito states that reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce, and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and Esposito state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] (''Beyond belief'') argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, "remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."  This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe (2005) vol. 5, pp. 66-76. "Social Sciences and the Qur’an"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of [[natural capital]], i.e. producing land. Traditions of [[haram (site)]] and [[hima (environmental protection)|hima]], an Arabic term meaning "protected place", and early [[urban planning]] were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within [[carrying capacity]] and to preserve the [[natural environment]] as an obligation of [[Caliph|khalifa]] or "stewardship".&lt;ref name="Haq"&gt;{{harvnb|Haq|2001|pp=111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muslims established themselves in [[Madinah]], Muhammad surveyed the
natural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verde|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]]s on agriculture and [[environmental philosophy]] were compiled in the "Book of Agriculture" of the ''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'', which included the following saying:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=There is none amongst the believers who plants a tree, or sows a seed, and then a bird, or a person, or an animal eats thereof, but it is regarded as having given a charitable gift [for which there is great recompense].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'' 3:513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=And there is no animal in the earth nor bird that flies with its two wings, but that they are communities like yourselves.{{cite quran|6|38}}}}

The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and [[environmental science]], especially pollution, were [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical treatises]] written by [[al-Kindi]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[al-Razi]], [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]], [[al-Tamimi]], [[al-Masihi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Ibn Jumay]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon]], [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], Ibn al-Quff, and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[municipal solid waste]] mishandling, and [[environmental impact assessment]]s of certain localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gari|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]] also had the first [[waste container]]s and [[waste disposal]] facilities for [[litter]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artz|1980|pp=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229042135/http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 |date=2008-02-29 }}, 1001 Inventions)&lt;/ref&gt;

"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Holy Quran and the Environment |url=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |year=2010 |chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued [[humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|rational]] approaches in discourses regarding [[values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic participation===
{{main|Islamic democracy}}
{{further|Shura|Ijma}}

In the early Islamic [[Caliphate]], the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2004|pp=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Electing or appointing a Caliph

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]] also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Ghamdy|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Majlis ash-Shura

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''[[shura]]'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]] advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:{{or|date=October 2010}}

{{quote|text={{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}}}
{{quote|text={{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}}}

The [[majlis]] is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute.  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, "but not one of its pillars," and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic.  Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.

===Religious pluralism===
Islamic legal framework included [[religious pluralism]]. Classical [[Sharia]], the [[religious law]]s and courts of  [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachedina|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
Citizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, as the [[rule of law]] was binding on the [[head of state]] just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when [[Umar]] tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|pp=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph [[Ali]]. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a [[Khutbah|sermon]] and a [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his "right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]] quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, "the idea of [[academic freedom]]" in universities was "modelled on Islamic custom" as practiced in the medieval [[Madrasah]] system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to his governor of Egypt, [[Malik al-Ashtar]]. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:
{{quote|text=Out of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to approach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear them and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange public audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness, courtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so that those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly and without fear. [http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/letters/letter53.htm Nahjul Balaagha letter 53]}}

===Human rights===
{{see also|Sharia|Early reforms under Islam|Caliphate|Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective|Women in Islam|Islamic feminism}}

In the field of human rights, early [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the [[charitable trust]] and the [[Trust law|trusteeship]] of property; the notion of brotherhood and [[social solidarity]]; the notions of human [[dignity]] and the [[dignity of labour]]; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of [[anti-social behavior]]; the [[presumption of innocence]]; the notion of "bidding unto good" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of [[sharing]], [[Duty of care|caring]], [[universalism]], fair [[industrial relations]], fair contract, commercial [[integrity]], freedom from [[usury]], [[women's rights]], [[privacy]], [[abuse]] of rights, [[juristic person]]ality, [[individual freedom]], [[equality before the law]], [[Legal aid|legal representation]], non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]], supremacy of the law, [[judicial independence]], judicial [[impartiality]], limited [[sovereignty]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] through contacts with [[Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and through the [[Crusades]] and the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=1. Pages 129-131 are opinions of the Sri Lankan Jurist Weeramantry; it is interesting primary source/claim, but disputed by vast majority of scholars. We need secondary or tertiary sources, or at least a few additional sources to this sweep of claims. 2. In the field of human rights, there is a lot of debate on its historical foundations, see Jack Donnelly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. For neutral point of view, this credit claim to Islam must be balanced by a summary of dispute.|date=July 2013}}

The concept of [[inalienable rights]] was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler "the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being." Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that "they become rights by [[reason]] of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter."&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[John Locke]]'s formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by [[Edward Pococke]], a professor of [[Islamic studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=8, 135, 139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of [[civil and political rights]] (covered in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: [[social rights|social]], economic and [[cultural rights]]. This latter category was not recognized in the [[Western law|Western legal]] tradition until the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=7, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of [[privacy]], which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badawi|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badr|Mayer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a [[Harvard University]] law professor, notes:

{{quote|text=As for sexism, the common law long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;}}

In the ''[[North Carolina Law Review]]'' journal, Professor John Makdisi of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] writes in "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law" article:

{{quote|text=[T]he manner in which an act was qualified as morally good or bad in the spiritual domain of Islamic religion was quite different from the manner in which that same act was qualified as legally valid or invalid in the temporal domain of Islamic law. Islamic law was secular, not canonical... Thus, it was a system focused on ensuring that an individual received justice, not that one be a good person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1999|p=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Count Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:

{{quote|text=Those Eastern thinkers of the ninth century laid down, on the basis of their theology, the principle of the Rights of Man, in those very terms, comprehending the rights of individual liberty, and of inviolability of person and property; described the supreme power in Islam, or Califate, as based on a contract, implying conditions of capacity and performance, and subject to cancellation if the conditions under the contract were not fulfilled; elaborated a Law of War of which the humane, chivalrous prescriptions would have put to the blush certain belligerents in World War I; expounded a doctrine of toleration of non-Moslem creeds so liberal that our West had to wait a thousand years before seeing equivalent principles adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars have suggested that the idea of "a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign", which led to the "genesis of European legal structures" and the development of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', may have been "brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the [[Levant]] about the governing system" established by [[Saladin]]. It has also been suggested that "much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence of Islamic law on European law was the [[presumption of innocence]], which was introduced to Europe by King [[Louis IX of France]] soon after he returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Crusades]]. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either [[trial by combat]] or [[trial by ordeal]]. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph [[Umar]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boisard|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include "the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Splichal|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rule of law

Islamic jurists anticipated the concept of the [[rule of law]], the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a [[duty]] to obey the same law. A [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. There were also a number of cases where [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135" /&gt; The following [[hadith]] established the principle of rule of law in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability:&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Narrated ‘Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle." When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah’s Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand."}}

Various Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]] period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=How the scholars lost their exalted status as keepers of the law is a complex story, but it can be summed up in the adage that partial reforms are sometimes worse than none at all. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman empire responded to military setbacks with an internal reform movement. The most important reform was the attempt to codify Shariah. This Westernizing process, foreign to the Islamic legal tradition, sought to transform Shariah from a body of doctrines and principles to be discovered by the human efforts of the scholars into a set of rules that could be looked up in a book.}}

{{quote|text=Once the law existed in codified form, however, the law itself was able to replace the scholars as the source of authority. Codification took from the scholars their all-important claim to have the final say over the content of the law and transferred that power to the state.}}

;Accountability of rulers

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]]. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] obliged [[rebellion]] upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'', and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:

{{quote|text={{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on qiyama) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}}}

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

;Right of revolution

According to scholar [[Bernard Lewis]], the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] have several points to make on governance regarding the [[right of revolution]] in Islam:

{{quote|text=The Quran, for example, makes it clear that there is a duty of obedience: "Obey God, obey the Prophet, obey those who hold authority over you." And this is elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, "there is no obedience in sin"; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, "do not obey a creature against his creator," again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Bimaristan}}

The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]], who wrote the ''Adab al-Tabib'' (''Conduct of a Physician''), the first treatist dedicated to [[medical ethics]]. He regarded physicians as "guardians of souls and bodies", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What the physician must avoid and beware of
* The manners of [[visitor]]s
* The care of [[Cure|remedies]] by the physician
* The [[dignity]] of the medical [[profession]]
* The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] of physicians
* The removal of corruption among physicians

Because Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about "health", than "illness", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt;

===Drugs===
The earliest known [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of illegal drugs occurred under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which prohibited the use of [[Hashish]], a preparation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], as a [[recreational drug]]. Classical [[Ulema|jurists]] in medieval [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its "medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar [[Az-Zarkashi]] spoke of "the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Lynn Mathre, with "this legal distinction between the [[intoxicant]] and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval [[Kalam|Muslim theologians]] were far ahead of present-day [[American law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical peer review===

The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]] (854–931) of al-Raha, [[Syria]], where the notes of a practising [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physician]] were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Spier|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al Kawi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroethics===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
Islamic [[neuroethics]] and [[neurotheology]] hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=Paladin&gt;{{harvnb|Paladin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated [[humane]]ly and be kept under care by a [[Legal guardian|guardian]], according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt; This positive neuroethical understanding of [[mental health]] consequently led to the establishment of the first [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century,&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early scientific understanding of [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] by medieval [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctions]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ethics==
{{main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] to international law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsay|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of diplomats, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] civilians; contracts across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's [[caliph|successor]] and [[Sahaba|close companion]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{harvnb|Aboul-Enein|Zuhur|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

===Prisoners of war===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}

After Sultan [[al-Kamil]] defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry/&gt;

{{quote|text=Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7" /&gt;}}

==Peace and justice==
{{main|Peace In Islamic Thought}}

As in other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic]] religions, peace is a basic concept of [[Islam]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "Islam" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as "submission"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term ''aslama'', which means "to surrender" or "resign oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet, J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|p=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") has the same [[S-L-M|root]] as the word ''Islam''.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|loc=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. The greeting "[[S-L-M|Salaam alaykum]]", favoured by [[Muslims]], has the literal meaning "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; Muhammad is reported to have said once, "Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents." "Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and Sharafuddin al [[Al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] have said&lt;ref&gt;[[Fath al-Bari]] and sharh [[sahih bukhari]] by Imam Al Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; that the words "his brother" mean any person irrespective of faith.

==Welfare==
{{main|Bayt al-mal}}

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in the 8th century. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurs. The [[Caliphate]] was thus one of the earliest [[welfare state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamid|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the ''[[Waqf]]'' ([[charitable trust]]s), often for the purpose of building of [[Madrassah]]s and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=309–310, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Concern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over [[animal rights]] by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, "''Disputes Between Animals and Man''", part of the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]], has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the [[Ayah|Qur'anic verse]]: "all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves" (6:38), the [[Shafi'i]] jurist [['Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami]] (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise ''Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings'' (''Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam'') which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|2011|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|1995|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bekoff|2010|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">A '''Jihad satire''' is a [[political satire]] that satirizes the idea of violent [[jihad]].

==As art==

The musical comedy ''[[Jihad! The Musical]]'' and the film ''[[Four Lions]]'' are works of art that satirise jihadis.&lt;ref name="Gardham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7594722/We-should-laugh-at-al-Qaeda-says-report.html|title=We should laugh at al-Qaeda, says report|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=Geneviève |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJstaff&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/17/trailer-for-jihad-satire-four-lions-debuts/  "'Four Lions' Jihad Satire Trailer Debuts,"] March 17, 2010, Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTrib&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/7266/counter-terrorism-comedy/ "Counter-terrorism comedy,"] International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Australian]]'' describes ''Four Lions'' as "a satire on Islamic jihadism and its murderous ambitions."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/jokes-on-jihad/story-e6frg8n6-1225906260351 "Jokes on jihad,"] Evan Williams, August 21, 2010, The Australian.&lt;/ref&gt;   The satirical ''Jihad! The Musical'' featured a hero who cheerfully sang, "I wanna be like Osama, I wanna bomb a path to fame across the Earth.  People may abhor me but by God, they won't ignore me, When the CIA determines what I'm worth."&lt;ref name=Gifford&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13923077 "Fringe Fest 'Jihad' Musical Touches Explosive Topics,"] Rob Gifford, Aug, 24, 2007, National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Jeff Dunham]]'s puppet character "Achmed the dead [[Islamic terrorism|terrorist]]" is a popular example of jihad satire in the United States.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1901490,00.html Belinda Luscombe. "The Puppet Master" ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine; June 8, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Achmed is a puppet who shouts, "Silence, I kill you!" whenever the audience laughs at something that offends his sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;Achmed the dead terrorist and humor in popular geopolitics, Darren Purcell, Melissa Scott Brown and Mahmut Gokmen, GeoJournal, 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunham explains that he portrays Achmed as incompetent so that when the audience realise that the character is "a bumbling idiot with problems in life", they appreciate that he is human.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;

==As healing==

Mental health professionals argue that humor and satire can alleviate the mental health impact of terror attacks, helping to heal the survivors of terror attacks and rescue personnel suffering the consequences of exposure to the horrors of deliberate mass murder.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Anne Pasquali, "Humor; An Antidote for Terrorism", ''[[Journal of Holistic Nursing]]'', Vol. 21, No. 4, 398-414 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Michael Bongar, ''Psychology of Terrorism'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mental health's role in combating terror,’" Derrick Hamaoka, Jun Shigemura, Molly Hall, Robert Ursano, ''Journal of Mental Health,'' 2004, Vol. 13, No. 6 : Pages 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political strategy==

Arab-American comedian [[Ray Hanania]] has written, "If there were a bit of humor in the Middle East, I think that there might not be so much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the environment that breeds fanaticism and terrorism."&lt;ref name=Hanania&gt;Ray Hanania, ''I'm Glad I Look Like a Terrorist: Growing up Arab in America,'' U. S. G. Publishing, 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Psychology Today]]'',  humor is the most powerful tool to prevent individuals from becoming  Islamic suicide bombers, however, to be effective, the humor has to come from within the Muslim community and it has to be "aimed at the culture's sacred values."&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-me-in-we/201001/comedy-counter-terrorism  “Comedy as Counter-Terrorism; Comedy as a Strategy of Counter-Terrorism,”] Molly Castelloe Fong, Ph.D. , Jan 26, 2010, Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Molly Castelloe Fong, "Humor has the potential to gradually, over time, alter what it means to be a heroic martyr in the mind of extremist groups."&lt;ref name=Fong/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] has reported that "Satire and ridicule can help win the fight against Al-Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique."&lt;ref name=Moutot&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtBqws_tP_7eOFEw0cdih33DNN_A "Fight Al-Qaeda with satire, ridicule: researchers"], Michel Moutot (AFP) – Apr 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63E6JT20100415 “Defeat al Qaeda by removing its "cool" image; The way to beat al Qaeda and stop Islamist groups gaining recruits to violent causes is to remove their "cool" image and make fun of terrorists instead, according to a major international study published on Friday,”] Michael Holden, April 15, 2010, Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] group, a think tank in the United Kingdom, is among the academic institutions that have suggested that satire can be an effective tool in undermining support for  violent jihad.&lt;ref name=Gardham/&gt;  According to some terrorism experts, successful recruitment for violent jihad depends upon convincing potential recruits that jihadis are "pious warriors of God". They postulate that by "highlighting their incompetence, their moral failings, and their embarrassing antics", it may be possible to "undermine" support for violent jihadi organizations including [[Al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-case-for-calling-them-nitwits/8130/|title=The Case for Calling Them Nitwits|last=Fair|first=Christine|date=July–August 2010|publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers for Demos recommend satire as a means of undermining the popularity of violent jihad, noting that "satire has long been recognised as a powerful tool to undermine the popularity of social movements: both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[British Union of Fascists|British Fascist party]] in the 1930s were seriously harmed by sustained satire."&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theedgeofviolence  ‘’The Edge of Violence, A Radical Approach to Extremism,’’] Jamie Bartlett, Jonathan Birdwell, April 16, 2010, Demos, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sexual orientation}}{{LGBT sidebar}}

'''Latent homosexuality''' is an [[erotic]] attraction toward members of the same sex that is not [[conscious]]ly experienced or expressed in overt action. This may mean a [[closeted|hidden]] inclination or potential for [[bi-curious|interest]] in [[homosexual]] relationships, which is either suppressed or not recognized, and which has not yet been explored, or may never be explored.

The term was originally proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Some argue that the latent homosexuality is a potentially [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] effect (that is, it is not present until suggested by a therapist).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Others argue that the term ''latent'' is not truly applicable in the case of homosexual urges, since they are often not in the unconscious or unexpressed category, but rather exist in the conscious mind and are (often violently) [[Psychological repression|repressed]] on a conscious level.

==Links to homophobia==
A [[theory]] that [[homophobia]] is a result of latent homosexuality was put forth in the late 20th century. A 1996 study conducted at the [[University of Georgia]] by Henry Adams, Lester Wright Jr., and Bethany Lohr&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://my.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf|pmid=8772014|year=1996|last1=Adams|first1=HE|last2=Wright Jr|first2=LW|last3=Lohr|first3=BA|title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal?|volume=105|issue=3|pages=440–5|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a number of homophobic males exhibit latent homosexuality. The research was done on 64 heterosexual men, 35 of whom exhibited homophobic traits and 29 who did not. They were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The groups did not differ in aggression.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

Three tests were conducted using [[penile plethysmography]]. While there was no difference in response when the men were exposed to [[heterosexual]] and [[lesbian]] [[pornography]], there was a major difference in response when the men were exposed to male homosexual pornography.

The researchers reported that 24% of the non-homophobic men showed some degree of [[tumescence]] in response to the male homosexual video, compared to 54% of the subjects who scored high on the homophobia scale. In addition, 66% of the non-homophobic group showed no significant increases in [[tumescence]] after this video, but only 20% of the homophobic men failed to display any arousal. Additionally, when the participants rated their degree of sexual arousal later, the homophobic men significantly underestimated their degree of arousal by the male homosexual video.

The results of this study indicate that individuals who score in the homophobic range and admit negative affect toward homosexuality demonstrate significant sexual arousal to male homosexual erotic stimuli.

A possible explanation is found in various psychoanalytic theories, which have generally explained homophobia as a threat to an individual's own homosexual impulses causing repression, denial, or reaction formation (or all three; West, 1977). Generally, these varied explanations conceive of homophobia as one type of latent homosexuality where persons either are unaware of or deny their homosexual urges.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

Another explanation of these data is found in Barlow, Sakheim, and Beck's (1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. It is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. Because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

[[Reparative therapy]] advocates {{who|date=May 2013}} disagree that the homophobic males were stimulated by genuine latent homosexuality, claiming that the stimulation arose from negative emotions such as anxiety.

==Links to environment==
Living in a homophobic [[culture]], not being exposed to homosexuality, and being surrounded by members of both genders may encourage latent homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Conversely, [[Situational sexual behavior|situational homosexuality]] may be due to exposure to a single-gender environment, such as a [[single-sex education|single-sex school]], prison, or military service.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==In fiction==
In [[Kingsley Amis]]' 1966 book, ''[[The Anti-Death League]]'' the main character is introduced while resisting treatment for repressed homosexuality – which a doctor believes that he has – despite the man being openly homosexual.

Latent homosexual themes were a common theme of science fiction films of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Geraghty2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lincoln Geraghty |title=American Science Fiction Film and Television |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkILrUVObWQC&amp;pg=PT23 |date=1 October 2009 |publisher=[[Berg Publishers|Berg]] |isbn=978-0-85785-076-8 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' the character Colonel Fitts ([[Chris Cooper]]) is depicted as being a latent homosexual. Throughout the film, Fitts makes several statements that are narrow-minded and [[homophobic]], and it disturbs the colonel that his son Ricky might be homosexual. However, towards the end of the film, it is revealed that Fitts himself has sexual feelings towards men when he approaches his neighbor Lester Burnham ([[Kevin Spacey]]) and kisses him, but Lester rejects Col.&amp;nbsp;Fitts, and this greatly humiliates him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1 |series=film title |title=American Beauty |website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">'''Louis-Hugues Vincent''' (31 August 1872 - 30 December 1960) was a French [[Archeologist]], [[monk]] of the [[Dominican Order]], who was educated at Jerusalem's [[École Biblique]]. He undertook important archaeological research in [[Palestine (region)]], primarily during the [[Mandatory Palestine]] period.

==Biography==
He was born in 1872 in [[Isère]] in the commune of [[Vernioz]], near [[Lyon]]. Immediately after his Dominican [[Novitiate]] training, in 1891, he was sent to Jerusalem at the Biblical School ("[[École Biblique]]") of [[St. Stephen's Basilica, Jerusalem|St. Stephen's Basilica]], founded a year before by [[Joseph-Joseph Lagrange]]. Vincent remained there all his life, with the exception of long stays in France during the World Wars.
 
At the École Biblique, Louis Vincent studied and was ordained a Catholic priest. Soon he became one of the most learned scholars in the field of biblical archeology, including ceramics and ancient objects, lecturing on archeology at the school. He came to know all the archaeological sites in the Holy Land.

He carried out excavations with Father [[Roland de Vaux]] in [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]], now in the [[West Bank]].

He published many articles in the ''[[Revue Biblique]]'' journal, of which he was the editor-in-chief between 1931 and 1938.

His tomb is in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] in the courtyard of the Dominican convent near the [[Damascus Gate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29981">The '''MOGUL framework'''  is a research framework aiming to provide a theoretical perspective on the nature of language. MOGUL (Modular On-line Growth and Use of Language) draws on the common ground underlying various related areas of cognitive science including psycholinguistics, [[theoretical linguistics]], first- and second-language acquisition, [[neurolinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]]; it is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research.

The MOGUL framework's background assumption is that the mind is composed of [[expert systems]] which have evolved over time, one of which is responsible for human linguistic ability. Historically, scientific studies of language have been divided between many sub-disciplines; theoretical linguists focus on the abstract properties of language&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers in other fields investigate how language is used and processed in real time: either in psychological terms or (in the case of neurolinguistics) through a study of the physical systems of neurons in the brain. Each field of study has developed its own research traditions and technical vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate insights across disciplines. The MOGUL Framework represents an attempt to identify common themes and compatible approaches in different (but related fields), and hence to facilitate integration.

==Overview==
MOGUL is designed as a platform for the generation of new hypotheses, with a terminology and a set of interrelated concepts that can be used across more than one discipline. Although not a full-fledged theory in its own right, it sets out various theoretical claims based on the current literature in a range of research domains. As suggested below it is not connectionist in the most widely used sense of that term, although it employs terms and concepts familiar to connectionists such as competition, activation, activation levels and so forth. The same processing perspective also requires the long-established Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance to be viewed in a somewhat different way. [[Linguistic competence]] (knowledge) is not compartmentalised and placed in a separate box in the model, which then forms the object for a processor (or processors) to act on. Rather, it is instantiated and implicit within the processing system. The distinction between mental representation and processing is still valid, but is expressed in a way that ought to allow the abstract properties of linguistic systems in the mind to be more easily investigated in conjunction with real-time linguistic phenomena. The inspiration for this approach is the work of [[Ray Jackendoff]]. Here the architecture of the [[language faculty]] is formulated in such a way as to facilitate statements about competence-related, representational issues and their relationship to real-time language processing within the same model.

==Scope==
Empirical evidence for the claims and assumptions set out in MOGUL rests essentially on the experimental findings of the various fields of research on which it is based. The MOGUL framework queries current solutions and raises new questions based upon this body of evidence, in the hope that answers to such questions will be sought in the related areas by appropriate researchers.

More specifically, MOGUL represents an attempt to provide ways of investigating how first- or second-language processing relates to linguistic development and how language in the monolingual and multilingual language user is situated within human cognitive architecture in general. What exactly happens, even in milliseconds, when someone is exposed to the sights and sounds of a new language? How do we explain what gets noticed and what gets regularly ignored? What about the fixed stages that people seem to pass though? How is it that we have so little conscious control over what we are attempting to acquire? Why do children appear to be worse language learners in the short run and much better in the long run? How can two or more language systems cohabit in one mind? Answers to these questions require an interdisciplinary approach. Two major sources for inspiration for the approach described here are the ideas of [[Generative linguistics|generative linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] on language faculty and modularity and [[Global Workspace Theory]], as advanced by [[Bernard Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars 1988, 1997; Jackendoff 1987, 2002, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first MOGUL publication was released in 2004 and was a keynote article in ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, J &amp; M. Sharwood Smith. (2004). Acquisition by processing: a modular  perspective on language development. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' 7,1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to situate languages within a wider cognitive context, the MOGUL framework is designed to provide a basic architecture that purports to explain how (in general terms) the mind functions. This means that it is not an account of brain function, although it is set out in such a way that might facilitate such accounts.

==Modules, processing units and working memory==
Briefly, MOGUL architecture follows Jackendoff in positing a generic cognitive module (or, in MOGUL, a processing unit) which consists of an integrative processor operating on structural elements (structures) in a memory store. Specifically, it works with activated elements that are raised into working memory from that memory store.

[[File:gen processor.jpg|300px|thumb|MOGUL architecture|alt=Diagram of MOGUL linguistic theory]]Modules are only somewhat generic in structure; the rest is very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of [[working memory]] as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: it is part of the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory "surface" within the same store.  In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley 2007, Cowan 1999, Nairne 2002 and Paradis 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from – and independent of – for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a MOGUL module (based on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see "MOGUL architecture in a nutshell" below).

This functional architecture may be neurally and anatomically instantiated in different ways: the design of systems such as that proposed by Jackendoff and others (including MOGUL) involves no specific claims about the precise nature and location of the neural system. These are two different levels of description. The auditory module (translated into cortical terms) involves several brain regions distributed across the supratemporal plane; activation in MOGUL terms (when translated into neurological terms) may involve both excitatory and inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, functional auditory structure (as described within the MOGUL framework) must be distinguished from anatomical and physiological auditory structure.

==Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT)==
An important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the [[parser]]. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only [[language acquisition]] and [[language attrition]] (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, W. (2005). Syntactic Carpentry: An Emergentist Approach to Syntax. Mahwah, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, the claim is that all development is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated.  Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word "ship" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying "sheep" and "shape" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener).&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The "ship" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic "use it or lose it" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole.

As we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned.

Although the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each module is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant modules (processing units) are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. MOGUL espouses both [[modularity]] of mind and a constrained form of [[connectionism]] with a complex web of expert systems, each with its own particular organising principles. In this way, MOGUL makes claims not only about language abilities but about the mind in general.

==Comprehension and production==
The core modules involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Phonological, syntactic and conceptual processing work in one direction in response to visual and auditory events in the environment (typically in listening to speech or reading a text), but they also work in the other direction to produce speech or writing (or messages in [[sign language]]). Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures.  Meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in [[Writing system|writing]] or signing.

When the basic direction of processing is, say, from conceptual structure to speech, the assembling of an appropriate structural chain is not carried out in a rigid unidirectional sequence; at different levels, different options will be available and compete for selection. In production, some options may be partially formed and then be dropped in favour of a better-fitting rival structure. In this way the ultimate structural chain is built up incrementally, out of the more accessible candidate structures that happen to provide the best overall fit at the time. Comprehension works according to the same principles, with parallel processing and split-second editing and revising until a best-fit interpretation is arrived at. It may be the wrong interpretation but it will be the best fit, given the person's current processing resources at that particular moment in time.

As an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage – in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus [[Syntax|syntactic structure]]) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in "a boy hit the ball", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain.  As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles.  Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure).

==Perception and affect (PopS and AfS)==
One feature of the MOGUL approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of [[perception]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of "a boy hit the ball" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept "boy". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co-activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. MOGUL follows the view that high levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of ''perceptual output structures'' (POpS).

POpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses – or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in MOGUL are ''visual structures'' (VS) and ''auditory structures'' (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word "dog" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully.

Perceptual output structures are strongly interconnected. This enables a coordinated responses to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, since POpS mediate between the external environment and the internal operations of the mind that are inaccessible to awareness, POpS conform closely with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, a hypothetical prerequisite for awareness to occur. It is also reflected in the condition known as [[synaesthesia]]: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. Another example of connection is provided by the experimentally-induced [[McGurk effect]]. Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips).

The main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word "dog" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its ''conceptual structure''(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do ''not'' have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and ''cannot'') achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature.

The affective system works with ''affective structures'' (AfS) that are constructed using primitives such as "fear" and "disgust", which are discussed in [[affective neuroscience]] in the work of [[António Damásio]].&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; AfS are connected to POpS and contribute directly to appropriate responses of the organism to events in the immediate environment, to its chances of survival and to the experience of conscious awareness. Making these aspects of mental life more explicit helps researchers to understand and devise hypotheses about how consciousness and emotion affect online language performance and language acquisition. By the same token, it should help to show how certain aspects of language behaviour are (or might be) immune to such influence.

==Knowing a language==
Language is a vague term and is its widest sense involves a host of different processing units, only some of which are what makes human language unique to this species, that is, the phonological and syntactic expert systems that make up what, in [[generative linguistics]], is called the [[language module]] and whose special properties are often subsumed under the name [[Universal Grammar]]. Closely associated with this core system, but not part of the language module per se, are a rich set of conceptual structures developed over the lifespan, as also b) auditory structures that have been matched up with phonological structures and c) visual structures created for interpreting writing and sign language. In addition, there are the various motor structures involved in the production of language in its different modes. One might lump all of this together and call it ''knowledge of language''. None of it, however, constitutes 'knowledge of language' if, by this term, we rather mean language that we can think and talk about and analyse, in other words ''metalinguistic knowledge'', which, as with all forms of [[metacognition]], is constructed out of conceptual structure and various perceptual output structures. [[File:metaroute.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Linguistic diagram]]To take a simple example, the word "horse" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the  sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning as illustrated in the figure on the right. Not represented in the figure is the additional conceptual structure (over above the meaning of horse itself), consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as ''word, syllable, noun, definition'' and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the language module is not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. In the MOGUL version of metalinguistic processing, the essential chain of connections that are assembled completely bypasses the PS and SS systems. Processing within the language module will always kick in automatically on exposure of language stimuli, but metalinguistic (explicit) activity is processed elsewhere. Following the standard arguments from [[learnability]] theory as applied in [[generative linguistics]], the language module is nevertheless crucial for all other types of linguistic activity and is vital for explaining the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; No amount of activation of auditory and conceptual structure alone can explain the growth of language in the mind following repeated exposure to speech, most obviously in the case of little children and (arguably) adults as well.

Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be "right" or "wrong". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however.  An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.

==MOGUL architecture in a nutshell==
In this figure, the MOGUL version of the cognitive system is sketched in simplified form. The circles or ovals represent specialised processors, and the rectangular boxes each represent the particular memory store of structures which they are designed to handle. Affective structures (AfS) are not differentiated in this figure. Also, for simplicity's sake, only five "senses" are portrayed in the POpS system. All languages are handled by the same syntactic and phonological processors, but different languages will involve both shared and unique ''syntactic structures'' (SS) and ''phonological structures'' (PS) residing in (respectively) their syntactic and phonological memory stores. Mental activity is characterised by the formation of chains or networks of structures across different modules. This is achieved by means of interface processors (the dotted arrows) following Jackendoff (1987). These are bimodular, in that they match elements in two adjacent modules; they can only access and link certain structural elements in one or the other module. Moreover, the matching is not a "translation" of one element into terms (the code) of another system; there is no exchange of information, merely a chaining of elements that can otherwise only be processed within its own particular processing unit or module.

'''Marine debris''', also known as '''marine litter''', is human-created [[waste]] that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a [[lake]], [[sea]], [[ocean]], or [[waterway]]. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[gyre]]s and on [[coast]]lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|title=Pollution invades small Pacific island|author=Gary Strieker|date=28 July 1998|accessdate=1 April 2008|publisher=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231062708/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently washing aground, when it is known as ''beach litter'' or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ''ocean dumping''. Naturally occurring debris, such as [[driftwood]], are also present.

With the increasing use of [[plastic]], human influence has become an issue as many types of plastics do not [[Biodegradation|biodegrade]]. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to [[fish]], [[seabird]]s, [[marine reptile]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s, as well as to boats and coasts.&lt;ref name="Facts22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101|title=Facts about marine debris|publisher=US NOAA|accessdate=10 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213110801/http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101/|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.

In efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies.

A wide variety of man-made objects can become marine debris; [[plastic bag]]s, [[balloon]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[rope]], [[medical waste]], [[glass]] and [[plastic bottles]], cigarette stubs, [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]]s, [[beverage can]]s, [[polystyrene]], [[ghost net|lost fishing line and nets]], and various wastes from [[cruise ship pollution|cruise ships]] and [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. [[Six pack rings]], in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990716.html |title=Should you cut up six-pack rings so they don't choke sea birds? |date=16 July 1999 |author=Cecil Adams |publisher=The Straight Dope |accessdate=11 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061820/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990716.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Litter, made from diverse materials that are denser than surface water (such as [[glass]]es, metals and some plastics), have been found to spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in [[coral]]s and interfere with other [[Benthos|sea-floor life]], or even become buried under sediment, making [[Marine salvage|clean-up]] extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to [[shipwrecks]].

==Great Pacific Garbage Patch==
{{main|Great Pacific garbage patch|l1=Great Pacific Garbage Patch}}

[[File:North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone.jpg|thumb|right|The currents of the North Pacific Gyre spiral inwards, depositing debris in the convergence zone.]]
Once waterborne, debris becomes mobile. Flotsam can be blown by the wind, or follow the flow of [[ocean current]]s, often ending up in the middle of [[oceanic gyre]]s where currents are weakest. The [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North [[Pacific Ocean]] rich with anthropogenic wastes. Estimated to be double the size of [[Texas]], the area contains more than 3 million tons of plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1011/p02s01-usgn.html |title=Congress acts to clean up the ocean - A garbage patch in the Pacific is at least triple the size of Texas, but some estimates put it larger than the continental United States |accessdate=10 October 2008 |publisher=''The Christian Science Monitor'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005231145/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1011/p02s01-usgn.html |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patches may be large enough to be viewed by [[satellite]]. For example, when the Malaysian Flight [[MH370]], disappeared in 2014, satellites were scanning the oceans surface for any sign of it, and instead of finding debris from the plane they came across floating garbage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Parker, Laura. "With Millions of Tons of Plastic in Oceans, More Scientists Studying Impact." ''National Geographic''. National Geographic Society, 13 June 2014. Web. 3 April 2016.

The oceans may contain as much as one hundred million [[ton]]s of plastic.&lt;ref name=Algalita/&gt;  It is estimated that each garbage patch in the ocean have up to one million tons of trash swirling around in them, sometimes extending down to around one hundred feet below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumura, Satsuki, and Keiichi Nasu.

&lt;/ref&gt; Some items that have been extracted from these garbage patches are: a drum of hazardous chemicals, plastic hangers, tires, cable cords, a ton of tangled netting etc.

Over 40% of oceans are classified as subtropical gyres, a fourth of the planets surface area has become an accumulator of floating plastic debris.

Not all [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] artifacts placed in the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink to the bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for [[artificial reef]]s. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |work=Disposal Options for Ships |title=Chapter 5: Reefing |accessdate=3 May 2008 |date=2 August 2006 |author1=Ron Hess |author2=Denis Rushworth |author3=Michael Hynes |author4=John Peters |publisher=Rand Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629110318/http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris removal==
[[File:DC WASA Marine Debris Skimmer.jpg|thumb|Skimmer boat used to remove floating debris and trash from the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Anacostia River|Anacostia]] rivers]]

Techniques for collecting and removing marine (or riverine) debris include the use of debris skimmer boats ''(pictured)''. Devices such as these can be used where floating debris presents a danger to navigation. For example, the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] removes 90 tons of "drifting material" from [[San Francisco Bay]] every month. The Corps has been doing this work since 1942, when a [[seaplane]] carrying Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] collided with a piece of floating debris and sank, costing the life of its pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |title=Debris collection onsite after Bay Bridge struck |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=7 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109084709/http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once debris becomes "beach litter", collection by hand and specialized [[beach cleaner|beach-cleaning machines]] are used to gather the debris.

Elsewhere, "trash traps" are installed on small rivers to capture waterborne debris before it reaches the sea. For example, [[South Australia]]'s [[Adelaide]] operates a number of such traps, known as "trash racks" or "gross pollutant traps" on the [[Torrens River]], which flows (during the wet season) into [[Gulf St Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719020149/http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|dead-url=yes|archivedate=19 July 2008|title=Trash Racks|publisher=Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In lakes or near the coast, manual removal can also be used. [[Project AWARE]] for example promotes the idea of letting dive clubs clean up litter, for example as a diving exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|title=10 Tips for Divers to Protect the Ocean Planet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923111851/http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|archivedate=23 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sea, the removal of artificial debris (i.e. plastics) is still in its infancy. However some projects have been started which used ships with nets (Kaisei and New Horizon) to catch some plastics, primarily for research purposes. Another method to gather artificial litter has been proposed by [[Boyan Slat]]. He suggested using platforms with arms to gather the debris, situated inside the current of gyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=MarineDebris.Info |url=http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |title=Methods for collecting plastic litter at sea |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024154340/http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |archive-date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is that removing marine debris from our oceans can potentially cause more harm than good.

== Laws and treaties ==
The ocean is a [[Global commons|global common]], so negative [[Externality|externalities]] of marine debris are not usually experienced by the producer. In the 1950s, the importance of government intervention with marine pollution protocol was recognized at the First Conference on the Law of the Sea.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leous|first=Justin P.|last2=Parry|first2=Neal B.|date=2005|title=WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARINE DEBRIS?

* [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]]- signed in 1982, but effective in 1994, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea emphasized the importance of protecting the entire ocean and not only specified coastal regions.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; UNCLOS enforced restrictions on pollution, including a stress on land-based sources.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Regulations imposed by this agreement have potential to help mediate effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redgwell|first=Catherine|date=2012|title=UNCLOS and Climate Change|jstor=10.5305/procannmeetasil.106.0406|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law)|volume=106|pages=406–409|doi=10.5305/procannmeetasil.106.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian law===
One of the earliest anti-dumping laws was Australia's ''Beaches, Fishing Grounds and Sea Routes Protection Act 1932'', which prohibited the discharge of "garbage, rubbish, ashes or organic refuse" from "any vessel in Australian waters" without prior written permission from the federal government. It also required permission for [[scuttling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1932A00073 |publisher=Federal Register of Legislation|title=Beaches, Fishing Grounds and Sea Routes Protection Act 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was passed in response to large amounts of garbage washing up on the beaches of [[Sydney]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] from vessels outside the reach of [[Local government in Australia|local governments]] and the [[New South Wales]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U--LBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230 |title=Sydney Beaches: A History |author=Caroline Ford |page=230 |year=2014 |publisher=NewSouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was repealed and replaced by the ''Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981'', which gave effect to the London Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00778 |publisher=Federal Register of Legislation |title=Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European law===
In 1972 and 1974, conventions were held in [[Oslo]] and [[Paris]] respectively, and resulted in the passing of the [[Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic|OSPAR Convention]], an international treaty controlling marine pollution in the north-east [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ospar.org/eng/html/welcome.html|title=The OSPAR Convention|publisher=OSPAR Commission|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212075312/http://www.ospar.org/eng/html/welcome.html|archivedate=12 February 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=29 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barcelona Convention]] protects the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

===Ownership===
[[Property law]], [[admiralty law]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] may be of relevance when [[lost, mislaid, and abandoned property]] is found at sea. [[Marine salvage|Salvage law]] rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a "[[treasure trove]]". In the [[United Kingdom]], shipwrecked goods should be reported to a [[Receiver of Wreck]], and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |title=Can you keep ship-wrecked goods? |accessdate=29 May 2008 |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123152554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |archivedate=23 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
A large number of groups and individuals are active in preventing or educating about marine debris. For example, [[5 Gyres]] is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution in the oceans, and was one of two organizations that recently researched the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. [[Heal the Bay]] is another organization, focusing on protecting [[California]]'s [[Santa Monica Bay]], by sponsoring beach cleanup programs along with other activities. [[Marina DeBris]] is an artist focusing most of her recent work on educating people about beach trash.

Forty-eight plastics manufacturers from 25 countries, are members of the Global Plastic Associations for solutions on Marine Litter, have made the pledge to help prevent marine debris and to encourage recycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mitigation ===
[[File:How_long_until_it's_gone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The decomposition times of marine debris]]

Marine debris is a problem created by all of us, not only those in coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Lorraine|date=29 June 2016|title=80% Of Ocean Plastic Comes From Land-Based Sources, New Report Finds.|url=http://www.ecowatch.com/80-of-ocean-plastic-comes-from-land-based-sources-new-report-finds-1891173457.html.|journal=EcoWatch|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean debris can come from as far away as Nebraska. The places that see the most damage are often not the places that produce the pollution. For ocean pollution, much of the trash may come from inland states, where people may never see the ocean and thus may never put any thought into protecting it. The problem continues to grow in tandem with plastics usage and disposal. Steps can be taken to prevent the movement of inland plastics into the oceans.

Plastic debris from inland states come from two main sources: ordinary litter and materials from open dumps and landfills that blow or wash away to inland waterways and wastewater outflows. The refuse finds its way from inland waterways, rivers, streams and lakes to the ocean. Though ocean and coastal area cleanups are important, it is crucial to address plastic waste that originates from inland and landlocked states.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, J. H. (2015). Managing Marine Plastic Pollution. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', ''123''(4), A90-A93. doi:10.1289/ehp.123-A90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|title=7 Ways To Reduce Ocean Plastic Pollution Today|website=www.oceanicsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330075852/https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the systems level, there are various ways to reduce the amount of debris entering our waterways:
* Improve waste transportation to and from sites by utilizing closed container storage and shipping
* Restrict open waste facilities near waterways
* Promote the use of [[Refuse-derived fuel]]s. Used plastic with low residual value often do not get recycled and are more likely to leak into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''Stemming the tide: Land-based strategies for a plastic-free ocean'' (pp. 1-48, Rep.). (2015). McKinsey Center for Business and Environment.&lt;/ref&gt; However, turning these unwanted plastics that would otherwise stay in landfills into refuse-derived fuels allows for further use; they can be used as supplement fuels at power plants
* Improve recovery rates for plastic (in 2012, the United States generated 11.46 million tons of plastic waste, of which only 6.7% was recovered&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2012 [fact sheet]. Washington, DC:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adapt [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] strategies to make producers responsible for product management when products and their packaging become waste; encourage reusable product design to minimize negative impacts on the environment&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. “Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 17, no. 2, 2013, pp. 175–185., doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00572.x.&lt;/ref&gt;
As consumers, there are things we can do to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our waterways:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
[[File:7_Swaps.jpg|thumb|7 simple single-use swaps people can make to save trash.]]
* Reduce usage of single-use plastics such as plastic bags, straws, water bottles, utensils and coffee cups by replacing them with reusable products such as reusable bags, metal straws, reusable water bottles, bamboo toothbrushes and reusable coffee cups
* Avoid microbeads, which are found in face scrubs, toothpastes and body washes
* Participate in a river or lake beach clean up
* Support municipality bans and other legislation regulating single-use plastics and plastic waste 
* Continue to recycle, recycle, recycle
Though the awareness of inland ocean conservation debris mitigation seems to be small compared to coastal states, some organizations in the United States are already working to improve this. The Colorado Ocean Coalition was formed in 2011 with the goal of impressing upon inland citizens that they don’t need to see the ocean to care about its health. It has since grown beyond one state and now forms the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org Inland Ocean Coalition], with the mission of promoting knowledge and awareness of how inland states contribute to pollution of the ocean, aiming to shatter the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mentality that often applies in this region.

“Those who live among mountains, rivers and inland cities have a direct impact on the cycle of life in the ocean,” reads the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org IOCO] website. "The changes we need to make to address the largest threats facing our seas—lowering carbon emissions, reducing trash and pollution, eating sustainable seafood, safeguarding watersheds, promoting marine protected areas (MPAs)—can happen from anywhere in the world.”

This organization has chapters in many inland US states and promotes programs like watershed cleanups, youth-centered education, and decreasing the use of plastic.

=== Plastic-to-fuel conversion strategy ===

[[The Clean Oceans Project|The Clean Oceans Project (TCOP)]] promotes conversion of the plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels, including [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[kerosene]], using plastic-to-fuel conversion technology developed by Blest Co. Ltd., a Japanese [[environmental engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosko |first=Sarah |title=Mid-Ocean Plastics Cleanup Schemes: Too Little Too Late? |url=http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |publisher=E-The Environmental Magazine |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044741/http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jimholm&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Holm: The Clean Oceans Project|url=http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|publisher=TEDxGramercy|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210180721/http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|archivedate=10 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamel|first=Jessi|title=From Trash to Fuel|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|publisher=Santa Cruz Good Times|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003518/http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Amy E.|title=Santa Cruz nonprofit hopes to make fuel from ocean-based plastic|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003927/http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCOP plans to educate local communities and create a financial [[incentive]] for them to [[recycle]] plastic, keep their shorelines clean, and minimize plastic waste.&lt;ref name = jimholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Response|url=http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|publisher=The Clean Oceans Project|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425021325/http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.bu.edu/av/core/journal/xxiii/Aruffo.pdf "Problems with the Noble Lie."] ''Boston University''.  Accessed 4 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[politics]], a '''noble lie''' is a [[myth]] or [[Lie|untruth]], often, but not invariably, of a religious nature, knowingly propagated by an [[elite]] to maintain social harmony or to advance an agenda. The noble lie is a concept originated by [[Plato]] as described in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

In [[religion]], a '''pious fiction''' is a narrative that is presented as true by the author, but is considered by others to be fictional albeit produced with an altruistic motivation. The term is sometimes used [[pejorative]]ly to suggest that the author of the narrative was deliberately misleading readers for selfish or deceitful reasons. The term is often used in religious contexts, sometimes referring to passages in religious texts.

[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
{{main|The Republic (Plato)}}
Plato presented the Noble Lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, ''gennaion pseudos'' – literally, "a lie or wrong opinion about origin") in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three [[social class]]es who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a [[Social stratification|socially stratified society]], wherein the populace are told "a sort of Phoenician tale":

{{Quotation|...the earth, as being their mother, delivered them, and now, as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take thought for her and defend her against any attack, and regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth...While all of you, in the city, are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet god, in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule, mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers, silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And, as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may sometimes happen that a golden father would beget a silver son, and that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 414e–15c&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Socrates proposes and claims that if the people believed "this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another."&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 415c–d&lt;/ref&gt; This is his ''noble lie'': "a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one..."&lt;ref&gt;414b–c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Karl Popper===
[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Karl Popper in 1990]]
{{main article|Karl Popper}}
Karl Popper accused Plato of trying to base religion on a noble lie as well. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper remarks, "It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion." Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically. Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209060939/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/07/open-society-vi-on-religion-as-a-noble-lie.html Positive Liberty » Open Society VI: On Religion as a Noble Lie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leo Strauss===

{{main article|Leo Strauss}}
Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the [[polis]]. Are myths needed to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure a stable society? Or can men dedicated to relentlessly examining, in [[Nietzsche]]'s language, those "deadly truths," flourish freely? Thus, is there a limit to the political, and what can be known absolutely? In ''The City and Man,'' Strauss discusses the myths outlined in [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']] that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. Seymour Hersh also claims that Strauss endorsed noble lies: myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 12, 2003, accessed June 1, 2007.{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''[[Reason Online]]'', July 1997, accessed February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', documentary filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]] opines that "Strauss believed it was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''; Episode 1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desmond Lee===

{{main article|Desmond Lee}}
"Plato has been criticized for his Foundation Myth as if it were a calculated lie. That is partly because the phrase here translated 'magnificent myth' (p.414b) has been conventionally mistranslated 'noble lie'; and this has been used to support the charge that Plato countenances manipulation by propaganda. But the myth is accepted by all three classes, Guardians included. It is meant to replace the national traditions which any community has, which are intended to express the kind of community it is, or wishes to be, its ideals, rather than to state matters of fact."&lt;ref name="Plato p177"&gt;Plato: The Republic, Penguin Classics, translated by Desmond Lee, p177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea of Faith===

{{main article|Sea of Faith}}
The Sea of Faith Network (SoF) aims are "Exploring and promoting religious faith as a human creation..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arguably not an organisation ''based'' on the noble lie, many of their members no longer believe, but continue to espouse religious beliefs for positive social control and continue to hold positions in many religious organizations and various church groups.

==Pious fiction==

===Examples===

====Religious context====
[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A. Christensen.jpeg|325px|right|thumb|A depiction of [[Joseph Smith]]'s description of receiving the golden plates from the [[angel Moroni]] at the Hill Cumorah]]
* [[historical method|Mainstream historical interpretations]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (i.e. the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Protestant]] [[Old Testament]]) often consider much of the Tanakh/Jewish Bible to be a pious fiction, such as the conquests of Joshua,&lt;ref&gt;Borras, Judit, ''Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century'', BRILL, 1999, p 117: ".. the overwhelming consensus of modern scholarship is that the conquest tradition of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] is a pious fiction composed by the deuteronomistic school …"&lt;/ref&gt; and the histories of the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/briefly-3-edgy-things-old-testament-works/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/3-things-i-would-like-to-see-evangelical-leaders-stop-saying-about-biblical-scholarship/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Christopher, The Hebrew Bible: A Comparative Approach'', Fortress Press, 2009, p 123: "Minimalists begin with the fact that the [[Hebrew Bible]] did not reach its present form until well after the [[Babylonian exile]] … most the that the story was formulated by a group of elites who wanted to justify their claims to dominate … In other words, the narrative [of the Hebrew Bible] is a pious fiction that bears little relation to the actual history of Palestine during the period it purports to narrate."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Daniel]] has also been described as a pious fiction, with the purpose of providing encouragement to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D. A. For the Love of God: A Daily Companion for Discovering the Riches of God's Word'', Good News Publishers, 2006, p 19: "Many critics doubt that the account of [[The Book of Daniel|Daniel 4]] is anything more than pious fiction to encourage the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mainstream historical-critical approaches often views stories in the New Testament such as [[Nativity of Jesus|the Virgin Birth]], [[the Visit of the Magi to Jesus]], and others, as pious fictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Testament in the Twentieth Century|last=Jones|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Book of Mormon]], one of the [[Standard Works]] of the [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], has been described as a [[hoax]] or pious fiction, and it is not accepted as containing [[divine revelation]] by those outside the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, Royal, ''The Book of Mormon: the earliest text'', Yale University Press, 2009, p x: "Outsiders generally consider this book [the Book of Mormon] a nineteenth-century hoax or pious fiction …"&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dale Eickelman writes that [[Muslim]] [[fuqaha|jurists]] employ a pious fiction when they assert that [[Shariah|Islamic law]] is invariant, when in fact it is subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;Eickelman, Dale, ''Muslim politics'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p 26: "Emendations and additions to purportedly invariant and complete Islamic law (sharia) have occurred throughout Islamic history…. Muslim jurists have rigorously maintained the pious fiction that there can be no change in divinely revealed law, even as they have exercised their independent judgment (ijtihad) to create a kind of de facto legislation."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The relationship between the modern celebration of [[Christmas]] and the [[historical Jesus|historical]] [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]] has also been described as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJIhXqNwIIUC&amp;lpg=PA476&amp;dq=christmas%20pious%20fiction&amp;pg=PA476#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pious%20fiction&amp;f=false |title=Scripting Jesus: The Gospels in Rewrite - L.

*Fredrick Pike describes some morale-boosting efforts during the [[Great Depression]] as pious fictions.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, Fredrick, ''FDR's Good Neighbor Policy: sixty years of generally gentle chaos'', University of Texas Press, 1995, p 79:
:"In the Depression era, a great many Americans, north and south of the border, succumbed to the pious fiction that underlay the Krausist-Areilist-Marxist nonmaterial rewards aspect of good neighborliness… Without the occasional seasoning of pious fictions, concocted by intellectuals who in their delusions of grandeur try to introduce elements of dream live into crude reality, might not the real world be a far more vicious jungle than it is?"&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oceanarium''' can be either a [[marine mammal park]], such as [[MarineLand]], or a large-scale [[Public aquarium|aquarium]], such as the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], presenting an [[ocean]] habitat with [[marine (ocean)|marine]] animals, especially large ocean dwellers such as [[shark]]s.

== First marine mammal parks==
{{Main article|Marine mammal park}}
[[Marineland of Florida]], one of the first [[theme park]]s in [[Florida]], United States, started in 1938, claims to be "the world's first oceanarium"

Marineland of Florida was developed as ''Marine Studios'' near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in [[Marineland, Florida]], which was followed in [[Florida]] by [[Miami Seaquarium]], opened in 1955 and in [[California]] by [[Marineland of the Pacific]], opened in 1954 near [[Los Angeles]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World, Africa USA]], opened in 1968 near [[San Francisco]].

==SeaWorld==
{{Main article|SeaWorld}}

[[SeaWorld San Diego]] was opened in 1964, developed by four fraternity brothers Milt Shedd, Ken Norris, David DeMott and George Millay.
[[SeaWorld]] Aurora opened in 1970 near [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].
[[SeaWorld Orlando]] was opened in 1973.
SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando) was sold to [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] (a publishing company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]) in 1976. 
They purchased Marineland of the Pacific in 1986 and closed the [[park]].
They had opened [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in 1988.
In 1989 they sold SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando, San Antonio) to [[Anheuser-Busch]], the world's largest brewer and owner of the [[Busch Gardens]] Safari Parks, for US$1.1 billion. 
In 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the [[Ohio]] [[park]] which finally ceased its activities in 2004.

== World's largest marine life park ==
[[File:Shedd belugas 2017-09-02.jpg|thumb|[[Beluga whale|Belugas]] swimming in the Abbott Oceanarium at the [[Shedd Aquarium]]. The lower level of the Oceanarium allows underwater viewing of the beluga whales and the dolphins.]]
When the 170,000-square-foot Oceanarium at the [[Shedd Aquarium]] in [[Chicago]] opened on April 27, 1991, it debuted as the largest indoor marine mammal facility in the world. The position as world's oceanarium has since shifted repeatedly in recent years. From 2005 to 2012 it was the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in the United States with an initial total water volume of {{convert|8500000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, later it expanded to {{convert|10000000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and home to 100–120,000 animals of 700 species. In 2012 it was surpassed by [[Marine Life Park]] in [[Singapore]] with a total water volume of {{convert|45000|m3|USgal|abbr=on}} and over 100,000 [[animals]] of more than 800 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/play/singapore-open-worlds-largest-oceanarium-610811|title=World's largest oceanarium opens|work=CNNGo Staff|publisher=CNN|date=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Singapore park was surpassed by the [[Chimelong Ocean Kingdom]] in China, the current record holder, with a total water volume of {{convert|48750|m3|USgal|-4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=guinnessworldrecords&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/3/chinas-hengqin-ocean-kingdom-confirmed-as-worlds-largest-aquarium-as-attraction-sets-five-world-records-56471/|title = China’s Hengqin Ocean Kingdom confirmed as world’s largest aquarium as attraction sets five world records |publisher = Guinness World Records|date = 31 March 2014|accessdate = 9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine public aquariums ==
[[File:Afrykarium tunel.jpg|thumb| The largest tank of the [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] in [[Wrocław]] shows the depths of the [[Mozambique Channel]], where sharks, rays, and other large [[pelagic fish]] can be viewed from this 18 meter long underwater [[acrylic tunnel]].]]
Modern marine aquariums try to create natural environments. A host of marine animals swim together in the four-story cylindrical tank of the [[New England Aquarium]] in [[Boston]], which opened in 1969.
At the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], which opened in 1981, a walkway spirals up through the center of two gigantic cylindrical tanks, the Atlantic Coral Reef and the Shark Alley, which display sharks, sawfish, and other sea creatures.
Since then, many new aquariums have sought even greater realism, often concentrating on local environments. The richly endowed [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in California, which opened in 1984, is an outstanding example.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leighton R., ''Aquariums: Windows to Nature'', Prentice Hall General Reference, New York, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-85019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] is the only themed oceanarium devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]] and located in [[Wrocław, Poland]]. A part of the [[Wrocław Zoo]], the idea behind the Afrykarium is to comprehensively present selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]]. Housing over 10 thousand animals, its breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 [[hectare]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Isler |first1=Danuta |title=A trip to Wroclaw Afrykarium |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/365527,A-trip-to-Wroclaw-Afrykarium |website=Radio Poland |publisher=Radio Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">'''Open management education''' refers to business and management programs and courses making use of [[open educational resources]] and [[open content]]. The main idea is to develop competences by re-use, combination and adaption of freely accessible, existing resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kalz, M., Specht, M., Nadolski, R., Bastiaens, Y., Leirs, N., and Pawlowski, J.M. (2010) OpenScout: Competence based management education with community-improved open educational resources, 17th EDINEBConference: Crossing borders in Education and Work-based Learning, London, UK, June 2010, [http://hdl.handle.net/1820/2452]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and purpose ==
Programs and trainings in business and management are often not affordable, especially for SMEs or for people in less developed countries. Therefore, open management education seems like a promising alternative for many stakeholders.

== Challenges ==
It is still an ongoing discussion which [[business models]] could be applied, such as sharing or add-on models. However, the domain is still developing and no business model has become mainstream. A good discussion can be found by Downes (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S. (2007): Models for Sustainable Open Educational Resources in Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects 3 29-44 February 27, 2007. [http://www.downes.ca/post/33401]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge is to find simple tools to adapt (the sometimes complex) resources.&lt;ref&gt;Mikroyannidis, Alexander; Okada, Alexandra and Connolly, Teresa (2011). Sharing practices and experiences on the authoring and adaptation of Open Educational Resources. In: Open Educational Resources 2011, 11–13 May 2011, Manchester, UK. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29265/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to open management education ==
There are many repositories, databases and web access points, some of them listed here:
* [http://learn.openscout.net OpenScout] providing access to global resources in the business and management sector.  It is possible to search for competences to be achieved and to get help with tools for adaptation (e.g. internationalizing materials, adapting the design, contextualizing), see also the Wikipedia entry for [[Openscout]]
* [http://www.khanacademy.org The Khan Academy] provides a variety of business courses.
* [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] access to courses from MIT, some of them related to management
* MERLOT [http://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?category=2202 Repository] (Category Business) 
* Globe Info (Federation of Repositories): (no browsing, just use keywords such as management or better more specific) [http://www.globe-info.org/ Search page]

An [[order of magnitude]] of [[time]] is (usually) a [[decimal]] prefix or decimal order-of-magnitude quantity together with a base unit of time, like a [[microsecond]] or a [[million years]]. In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a "[[second]]" or "[[year]]". In other cases, the quantity name implies the [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], like "[[century]]". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years. Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years, so we say "a million years", not "a megayear". Clock time and calendar time have [[duodecimal]] or [[sexagesimal]] '''orders of magnitude''' rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.

The smallest meaningful increment of time is the [[Planck time]], the time light takes to traverse the [[Planck distance]], many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.  The largest ''realized'' amount of time, given known scientific data, is the [[age of the universe]], about 13.8 billion years - the time since the [[Big Bang]] as measured in the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[rest frame]].  Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude.  Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of [[calendar]] and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. [[leap year]]s versus regular years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an [[annum]] and denoted with the symbol ''a'', whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the [[Julian calendar]] which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of [[geological science]], to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to ''giga-annum'', or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ([[short scale]]: one ''billion'' years, [[long scale]]: one ''milliard'' years).

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

====Other====
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

===Techniques used in policy analysis===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
*Cost–benefit analysis
*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]] (PERT)
*[[Critical path method]] (CPM).

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Saint-Germain, California State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy.

'''Reactive attachment disorder''' ('''RAD''') is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon [[attachment disorder|disorder]] that can affect children.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"&gt;DSM-IV-TR (2000) [[American Psychiatric Association]] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Daniel Schechter|Schechter]] DS, Willheim E | title = Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–86 |date=July 2009 | pmid = 19486844 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 | pmc = 2690512}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts.  It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the "inhibited form". Due to recent revision in the [[DSM-5]] the "disinhibited form" is now considered a separate diagnosis named "[[disinhibited attachment disorder]]".

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of [[neglect]], [[abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent change of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is differentiated from [[pervasive developmental disorder]] or developmental delay and from possibly [[comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions such as [[intellectual disability]], all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment ''disorder'' are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment ''styles'']] such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="prior228"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on [[attachment theory]] and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless "attachment disorder" within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as [[attachment therapy]]. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment ''therapy'', some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be [[wikt: antithetical|antithetical]] to attachment ''theory''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor &amp; Nilsen"&gt;O'Connor TG, Nilsen WJ (2005) "Models versus Metaphors in Translating Attachment Theory to the Clinic and Community".

Duke series in Child Development and Public Policy. (2005) {{ISBN|1-59385-470-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many constitute [[child abuse|abuse]].

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Attachment theory| attachment disorder}}
[[Pediatricians]] are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. [[Infant]]s up to about 18–24 months ''may'' present with [[Failure to thrive|non-organic failure to thrive]] and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with [[malnutrition]] or [[dehydration]], while serum [[growth hormone]] levels will be normal or elevated.&lt;ref name=Sad04&gt;{{cite book |title=Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry |last=Sadock |first=BJ |author2=Sadock VA  |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7817-5033-4 |pages=570–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in three ways:

# Indiscriminate and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult, even relative strangers (older children and adolescents may also aim attempts at peers). This may often times appear as denial of comfort from anyone as well.
# Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.
# Actions that otherwise would be classified as [[conduct disorder]], such as [[Animal abuse|mutilating animals]], [[Sibling abuse|harming siblings]] or other family, or [[Self-harm|harming themselves intentionally]].&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 80. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.&lt;ref name="Rutter 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutter M |title=Nature, nurture, and development: from evangelism through science toward policy and practice |journal=Child Dev |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |year=2002 |pmid=14717240 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RICHTERS|first=MARGOT MOSER|last2=VOLKMAR|first2=FRED R.|date=1994-03-01|title=Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709641733|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=33|issue=3|pages=328–332|doi=10.1097/00004583-199403000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment tools===
There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"/&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment,&lt;ref name= "Crittenden 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crittenden PM |title= Quality of attachment in the preschool years|journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 4 |issue=02 |pages= 209–41|year= 1992 |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0954579400000110|accessdate= 6 January 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400000110}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment,&lt;ref name="NICHHD"&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |year=1996 |title=Characteristics of infant child care: Factors contributing to positive caregiving |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=269–306(38) |doi= 10.1016/S0885-2006(96)90009-5 |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Attachment Q-sort]]&lt;ref name="Waters &amp;amp; Deane 1985"&gt;Waters E, Deane K (1985).

''Growing pains of attachment theory and research: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'' 50, Serial No. 209 (1–2), pp. 41–65.&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of narrative techniques using [[attachment measures#Other approaches|stem stories]], puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|Child Attachment Interview]] and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp; Benoit 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America|vauthors=Zeanah CH, Benoit D | year= 1995 |title= Clinical applications of a parent perception interview in infant mental health |volume= 43| pages= 539–554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] (DAI) developed by Smyke and [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Smyke &amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;Smyke A, Zeanah CH (1999). "Disturbances of Attachment Interview". Available on the ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'' website at www.jaacap.com via Article plus.[http://acs.tx.ovid.com/acs/.93554d254ce5ec50e95dc1edabf7938b1c449aa9b2907e89124e214976c8be5cd89fe896880c65062e4945ba06270e8ea898a69e2b2e5aa1286b97438aef50246f.doc] Retrieved on 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The DAI is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely "having a discriminated, preferred adult", "seeking comfort when distressed", "responding to comfort when offered", "social and emotional reciprocity", "emotional regulation", "checking back after venturing away from the care giver", "reticence with unfamiliar adults", "willingness to go off with relative strangers", "self-endangering behavior", "excessive clinging", "vigilance/hypercompliance" and "role reversal". This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.

==Causes==
Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to [[genetic defect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt; reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that types of [[temperament]], or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals  susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=492–502 |doi= 10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |vauthors=Marshall PJ, Fox NA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.&lt;ref name="prior"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that the abuse and neglect was far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp;amp; Fox (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Fox NA |title=Temperament and attachment disorders |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=32–41 |year=2004 |pmid=15028539 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3301_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year [[twin study]], it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of [[psychopathology]], including RAD, [[Borderline Personality Disorder]] (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order [[Emotional dysregulation|self-regulation]] is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the "templates" in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for "re-regulation" (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of "corrective" experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heller SS, Boris NW, Fuselier SH, Page T, Koren-Karie N, Miron D |title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins follow-up: from 18 months to 8 years |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=63–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16581624 |doi=10.1080/14616730600585177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Attachment measures}}
RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"/&gt; There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.&lt;ref name="prior228"/&gt;

According to the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation.&lt;ref name="AACAP"&gt;[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder Reactive Attachment Disorder.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203213050/http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder |date=3 February 2008 }} American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, Facts for Families,  No. 85; Updated December 2002.  Retrieved on 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see  [http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php Reactive Attachment Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228050441/http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php |date=28 December 2007 }}, DCFS, State of Illinois and [http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/attach.pdf DBHS Practice Protocol: Disturbances and Disorders of Attachment] (PDF), Arizona Department of Health Services, 2 October 2006. Retrieved on 2008-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[British Association for Adoption and Fostering]] (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child’s individual and family history.&lt;ref name="BAAF"&gt;[http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf Attachment Disorders, their Assessment and Intervention/Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002051146/http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }} (PDF). British Association for Adoption and Fostering, Position Statement 4, 2006. Retrieved on 23 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
ICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
* markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts (e.g., the child is avoidant or unresponsive to care when offered by caregivers or is indiscriminately affectionate with strangers);&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;
* the disturbance is not accounted for solely by [[Child development|developmental]] delay and does not meet the criteria for [[pervasive developmental disorder]];
* onset before five years of age (there is no age specified before five years of age at which RAD cannot be diagnosed);&lt;ref name=DSMIV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Text Revision|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|pages=943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a history of significant neglect;
* an implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.

ICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of "[[pathogenic]] care" defined as persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is the child's history of care rather than observation of symptoms.

In DSM-IV-TR the ''inhibited'' form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour).&lt;ref name= "DSM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 313.89 Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood  |publisher= AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC) |location= United States}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The ''disinhibited'' form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures).&lt;ref name ="DSM"/&gt; There is therefore a lack of "specificity" of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.

The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:
* [[Child abuse|abuse]], ([[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or physical), in addition to neglect;
* associated emotional disturbance;
* poor social interaction with peers, aggression towards self and others, misery, and growth failure in some cases (inhibited form only);
* evidence of capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness as shown by elements of normal social relatedness in interactions with appropriately responsive, non-deviant adults (disinhibited form only).

The first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; ICD-10 states the disinhibited form "tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances". Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision.&lt;ref name="WHO1992"&gt;World Health Organisation (1992) ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)''. Geneva: World health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zilberstein K | year = 2006 | title = Clarifying core characteristics of attachment disorders | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]] | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 55–64 | doi=10.1037/0002-9432.76.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V.&lt;ref name=DSM-V&gt;Proposed Revision Reactive Attachment Disorder, ''American Psychiatric Association'' (2012). Retrieved from http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=120&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as ''Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood''.&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;

In regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.&lt;ref name=DSM-V /&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained [[mental health]] expert with particular expertise in [[differential diagnosis]] is considered essential.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanson RF, Spratt EG |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder: what we know about the disorder and implications for treatment |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=137–45 |year=2000 |pmid=11232086 |doi=10.1177/1077559500005002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980109603678 |author=Wilson SL |title=Attachment disorders: review and current status |journal=J Psychol |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=37–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11235838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Several other disorders, such as [[conduct disorder]]s, [[oppositional defiant disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[post traumatic stress disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as [[autism spectrum|autism]], [[pervasive developmental disorder]], [[pediatric schizophrenia|childhood schizophrenia]] and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt; Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

===Alternative diagnosis===
In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]], were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as [[attachment therapy]]. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, [[Externalization|externalizing]] behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)|Attachment therapy}}
Assessing the child's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, [[family therapy]], individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;

In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=November 2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title= Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |last1=Boris |first1=Neil W. |last2=Zeanah |first2=Charles H. |author3=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)62229-2/fulltext |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:
# "The most important intervention for young children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and who lack an attachment to a discriminated caregiver is for the clinician to advocate for providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure."
# "Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder is based on symptoms displayed by the child, assessing the caregiver's attitudes toward and perceptions about the child is important for treatment selection."
# "Children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. After ensuring that the child is in a safe and stable placement, effective attachment treatment must focus on creating positive interactions with caregivers."
# "Children who meet criteria for reactive attachment disorder and who display aggressive and oppositional behavior require adjunctive (additional) treatments."

Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.''

===Attachment therapy===
{{main|Attachment therapy}}

The terms [[attachment disorder]], attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaffin|first=Mark|last2=Hanson|first2=Rochelle|last3=Saunders|first3=Benjamin E.|last4=Nichols|first4=Todd|last5=Barnett|first5=Douglas|last6=Zeanah|first6=Charles|last7=Berliner|first7=Lucy|last8=Egeland|first8=Byron|last9=Newman|first9=Elana|date=2006-02-01|title=Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment Therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems|url=http://cmx.sagepub.com/content/11/1/76|journal=Child Maltreatment|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=76–89|doi=10.1177/1077559505283699|issn=1077-5595|pmid=16382093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the mainstream programs is a [[Attachment therapy#Treatment characteristics|form of treatment]] generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These "attachment disorders" use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Sufferers of "attachment disorder" are said to lack empathy and remorse.

Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006 pp. 79"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 85. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; There is little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]] and techniques vary from non-coercive [[Therapy|therapeutic]] work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the [[Evergreen model]]. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.''

==Prognosis==
The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Rutter M |title=Attachment disorder behavior following early severe deprivation: extension and longitudinal follow-up.

Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.&lt;ref name="Roy ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy P, Rutter M, Pickles A |year=2004 |title=Institutional care: Associations between overactivity and lack of selectivity in social relationships|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=866–73  |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00278.x |pmid=15056316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinshaw-Fuselier|first1=Sarah|last2=Boris|first2=Neil W.|last3=Zeanah|first3=Charles H.|title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=20|issue=1| year=1999| pages=42–59|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;42::AID-IMHJ4&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.

In the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors—a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within "secure base distortion", (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child's "internal working models". The twins' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as "quite concerning". The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|narrative measures]] used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"/&gt;

One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on [[Self monitoring|self-monitoring]] (regulating your behavior to "look good"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.&lt;ref name="Hall &amp;amp; Geher (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980309600605 |vauthors=Hall SE, Geher G |title=Behavioral and personality characteristics of children with reactive attachment disorder|journal=J Psychol |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=145–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12735525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Epidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"/&gt; The [[prevalence]] of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages.&lt;ref name="prior" /&gt; There is little systematically gathered [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] information on RAD.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Skovgaard AM, Houmann T, Christiansen E, etal |year=2007 |title= The prevalence of mental health problems in children 1½ years of age&amp;nbsp;– the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry  |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=62–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01659.x |pmid= 17244271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there.&lt;ref name="Chisholm ''et al.''

A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Smyke ''et al.''(2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smyke AT, Dumitrescu A, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disturbances in young children.

There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Hinshaw-Fuselier SS, Smyke AT, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS, Zeanah CH |title=Comparing criteria for attachment disorders: establishing reliability and validity in high-risk samples |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=568–77 |year=2004 |pmid=15100563 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200405000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in ''maltreated'' rather than ''neglected'' toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 81. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties.&lt;ref name="dsm"&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994, as discussed in Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders.&lt;ref name="dsm"/&gt; [[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] is a common and normal human characteristic.&lt;ref name="Bonanno"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonanno GA|year=2004 |title=Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events? |format=PDF |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/bem/behavhealth/documents/loss_trauma.pdf|accessdate=26 January 2008 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20 |pmid=14736317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in [[foster care|foster children]], [[adoption|adoptive children]], or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

There are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"/&gt; Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Attachment theory|Attachment in children}}
Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard [[nosology|nosologies]] of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with [[failure to thrive]]. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.&lt;ref name="Zean96"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeanah CH |title=Beyond insecurity: a reconceptualization of attachment disorders of infancy |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=42–52 |year=1996 |pmid=8907083 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.64.1.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is [[attachment theory]], based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by [[John Bowlby]], [[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[René Spitz]]. Attachment theory is a framework that employs [[Psychology|psychological]], [[Ethology|ethological]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to ''seek proximity'' to a ''particular attachment figure'' (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress,  behavior which appears to have survival value.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment [[Human behavior|behaviors]] tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. [[Attachment in children|Infants become attached to adults]] who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 313–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name=" Bretherton &amp;amp; Munholland 1999"&gt;Bretherton I, Munholland KA (1999). "Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited". In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 89–111. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.

The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as ''styles'' or ''patterns''. There are four attachment [[Attachment in children#Attachment patterns|styles]] ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all ''organized'')&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"&gt;Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S (1979). ''Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation.'' Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''disorganized''.&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1986). "Discovery of an insecure disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern: procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior". In Brazelton TB and Yogman M (Eds.) ''Affective development in infancy'', pp. 95–124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex {{ISBN|0-89391-345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1990). "Procedures for identifying infants as disorganized/disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation". In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 121–60. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three are characterised as ''insecure''. These are assessed using the [[Attachment measures#Measuring attachment in children|Strange Situation Procedure]], designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"/&gt;

Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Dev |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145–52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00128 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A [[disease|disorder]] in the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.&lt;ref name="O'Con '02"&gt;O’Connor TG (2002), "Attachment disorders in infancy and childhood". In Rutter M, Taylor E, (Eds.) ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Modern Approaches'' (4th  ed.) Blackwell Scientific publications. pp. 776–792. {{ISBN|0-632-01229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term "attachment disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 77. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.'' 1996)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH, Larrieu JA, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS |title=Attachment disorders in infancy and early childhood: a preliminary investigation of diagnostic criteria|journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=295–97 |date=1 February 1998|pmid=9464217|doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.295|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9464217 |accessdate=31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Scheeringa M, Boris N, Heller S, Smyke A, Trapani J |date=August 2004 |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder in Maltreated Toddlers  |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect: the International Journal |volume=28 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.010 |pages=877–88 |pmid=15350771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by [[C.H. Zeanah]] and N. Boris. The first of these is ''disorder of attachment,'' in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is ''secure base distortion'', where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is ''disrupted attachment''. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed.&lt;ref name="Boris &amp;amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |year=1999 |title= Disturbance and disorders of attachment in infancy: An overview|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=20|pages=1–9 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;1::AID-IMHJ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeanah 2000"&gt;Zeanah CH (2000). "Disturbances and disorders of attachment in early childhood". In Zeanah CH (Ed.) ''Handbook of infant mental health'' (2nd ed.) pp. 358–62. New York: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665–687.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn M, Bakermans-Kranenburg M |date=September 2003 |title=Attachment disorders and disorganized attachment: Similar and different |journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=313–20(8) |doi= 10.1080/14616730310001593938 |pmid=12944229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg 1999"&gt;Greenberg MT (1999). ''Attachment and Psychopathology in Childhood.'' In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 469–96. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work by C.H. Zeanah&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.&lt;ref name= "Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990)"&gt;Main M, Hesse E (1990) "Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infants' insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment status: Is frightened or frightening behavior the linking mechanism?" In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 161–182 Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-V Proposed Draft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">An individual's or community's '''religious orientation''' involves [[presumption]]s about the existence and nature of God or gods, religious prescriptions about morality and communal and personal spirituality. Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology.

==Psychology==

According to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that "religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;Whitley, B.E. &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA. 	Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, "These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==

[[Gordon Allport|Allport]] &amp; Ross developed a means of measuring  religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., &amp; Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of 	Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-443.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample statement from this scale would be “The church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships” (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger &amp; Jacson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; Jackson, L. M. (2005). Religion, Meaning, and Prejudice. Journal of Social Issues, 	61(4), 807-826.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrinsic==

Extrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non-religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end.&lt;ref name=batson&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=Daniel|title=Religion and the Individual|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506208-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in external religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in external religious orientation use religion, “to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification” (Allport &amp;Ross, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;434). (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010)&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunsberger &amp; Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation but there have been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger &amp; Jackson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a politician who goes to church in order to gain votes.

==Intrinsic==

According to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempt to live their lives as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with what Daniel Batson would say; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, "An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends." &lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. 

===Prejudice===

Research has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They live their religion, and as a result those, "with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter group tolerance." Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to have little regard for homosexuals. {{Citation needed|reason=show evidence the Bible is not racist or tribalist|date=December 2017}}

While this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life.

==Quest orientation==

A third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, "An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought."&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Prejudice===

Intuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the "Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of "universal love and compassion" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

Examples of people who have attained a quest orientation are [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice the young cottonwood and sycamore trees at the left.]]
'''Riparian-zone restoration''' is the [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] of '''[[riparian zone|riparian-zone]]''' '''[[habitat]]s''' of streams, rivers, [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, lakes, [[floodplain]]s, and other [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] ecologies. A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. ''Riparian'' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen  terrestrial [[biome]]s of the earth; the habitats of plant and animal communities along the margins and [[Bank (geography)|river banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plants]] and animals that favor them. Riparian zones are significant in [[ecology]], [[environmental management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their [[habitat]] [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]], [[woodland]], [[wetland]] or sub-surface features such as [[water table]]s.  In some regions the terms ''riparian woodland'', ''[[riparian forest]]'', ''riparian buffer zone,'' or ''riparian strip'' are used to characterize a riparian zone.

The perceived need for '''Riparian-zone restoration''' has come about because riparian zones have been altered and/or degraded throughout much of the world&lt;ref name=Richardson2007&gt;{{harvnb|Richardson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the activities of mankind affecting natural geologic forces. The unique [[biodiversity]] of riparian [[ecosystem]]s and the potential benefits that natural, vegetated riprarian have to offer in preventing [[erosion]], maintaining water quality that ranges from being decent to completely healthy, providing habitat and [[wildlife corridor]]s, and maintaining the health of in-stream [[biota (ecology)|biota]] ([[:Category:Aquatic organisms|Aquatic organisms]]) has led to a surge of restoration activities aimed at riparian ecosystems in the last few decades.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Hawkins|Kershner|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Restoration efforts are typically guided by an ecological understanding of riparian-zone processes and knowledge of the causes of degradation.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; They are often interdependent with [[stream restoration]] projects.

== Causes of riparian-zone degradation ==
Riparian-zone [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] falls into two main categories: hydrologic modifications that indirectly impact riparian communities through changes in [[Channel types|stream morphology]] and hydrologic processes, and habitat alterations that result in direct modification of riparian communities through land clearing or disturbance.

=== Hydrologic modifications ===

==== Dams and diversions ====
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
Dams are built on rivers primarily to store water for human use, generate hydroelectric power, and/or control flooding. Natural riparian ecosystems upstream of dams can be destroyed when newly created reservoirs inundate riparian habitat. Dams can also cause substantial changes in downstream riparian communities by altering the magnitude, frequency, and timing of flood events and reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients delivered from upstream.&lt;ref name=MerrittCooper2000&gt;{{harvnb|Merritt|Cooper|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993&gt;{{harvnb|Stromberg|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverting water from stream channels for agricultural, industrial, and human use reduces the volume of water flowing downstream, and can have similar effects.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

In a natural riparian system, periodic flooding can remove sections of riparian vegetation. This leaves portions of the floodplain available for regeneration and effectively “resets” the successional timeline.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Frequent disturbance naturally favors many early-successional (pioneer) riparian species.&lt;ref name=AzamiSuzukiToki2004&gt;{{harvnb|Azami|Suzuki|Toki|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies show that a reduction in flooding due to dams and diversions can allow community succession to progress beyond a typical stage, causing changes in community structure.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AzamiSuzukiToki2004 /&gt;

Changing flood regimes can be especially problematic when exotic species are favored by altered conditions. For example, dam regulation changes floodplain [[hydrology]] in the southwest US by impeding annual flooding cycles. This modification has been implicated in the dominance of saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) over the native cottonwood (Populus deltoids). Cottonwoods were found to be competitively superior to saltcedar when flooding allowed seeds of both species to cogerminate. However, the lack of flooding caused by altered hydrology creates more favorable conditions for the germination of saltcedar over cottonwoods.&lt;ref name=Bhattacharjee2009&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharjee|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Groundwater withdrawals ====
Riparian zones are characterized by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; In addition to having frequent direct contact with surface water through periodic rises in stream water levels and flooding, riparian zones are also characterized by their proximity to [[groundwater]]. Particularly in arid regions, shallow groundwater, [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and springs provides a more constant source of water to riparian vegetation than occasional flooding.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; By reducing the availability of water, groundwater withdrawals can impact the health of riparian vegetation.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996&gt;{{harvnb|Stomberg|Tiller|Richter|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Populus fremontii|Fremont cottonwood]] (''Populus fremontii''), and [[Salix gooddingii|San Joaquin willow]] (''Salix gooddingii''), common riparian species in Arizona, were found to have more dead branches and experienced greater mortality with decreasing groundwater levels.&lt;ref name=HortonKolbHart2001&gt;{{harvnb|Horton|Kolb|Hart|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant community composition can change dramatically over a gradient of groundwater depth: plants that can only survive in wetland conditions can be replaced by plants that are tolerant of drier conditions as groundwater levels are reduced, causing habitat community shifts and in some cases complete loss of riparian species.&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996 /&gt; Studies have also shown that decreases in groundwater levels may favor the invasion and persistence of certain exotic [[invasive species]] such as [[Tamarix chinensis|Saltcedar]] (''Tamarix chinensis''), which do not appear to show the same degree of physiologic water stress as native species when subjected to lower groundwater levels.&lt;ref name=HortonKolbHart2001 /&gt;

==== Stream channelization and levee construction ====
Stream [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]] is the process of engineering straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; [[Levee]]s are often constructed in conjunction with channelization to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riparian vegetation can be directly removed or damaged during and after the channelization process.&lt;ref name=Hupp1992&gt;{{harvnb|Hupp|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, channelization and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt; As water flows through a natural stream, meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings.&lt;ref name=ScottFriedmanAuble1996&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|Friedman|Auble|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for riparian vegetation recruitment.

By preventing overbank flooding, levees reduce the amount of water available to riparian vegetation in the floodplain, which alters the types of vegetation that can persist in these conditions.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; A lack of flooding has been shown to decrease the amount of habitat heterogeneity in riparian ecosystems as wetland depressions in the floodplain no longer fill and hold water.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt; Because habitat heterogeneity is correlated with species diversity, levees can cause reductions in the overall biodiversity of riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt;

=== Habitat alteration ===

==== Land clearing ====
In many places around the world, vegetation within  riparian zones have been completely removed as humans have [[Deforestation|cleared land]] for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; Removing riparian vegetation increases the erodibility of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration (unless the newly cleared banks are lined with riprap, retaining walls, or concrete).&lt;ref name=MicheliKirchnerLarsen2004&gt;{{harvnb|Micheli|Kirchner|Larsen|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, removal of riparian vegetation fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

==== Livestock grazing ====
{{see also|Noxious weed}}
[[Cattle]] have a propensity to aggregate around water, which can be detrimental to riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; While native [[ungulate]]s such as deer are commonly found in riparian zones, [[livestock]] may trample or graze down [[native plant]]s, creating an unnatural amount and type of disturbance that riparian species have not evolved to tolerate.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarr2002&gt;{{harvnb|Sarr|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock [[grazing]] has been shown to reduce areal cover of native plant species, create disturbance frequencies that favor exotic annual weeds, and alter plant community composition. For example, in an arid South African ecosystem, grazing was found to cause a reduction of grasses, sedges, and tree species and an increase in non-succulent shrubs.&lt;ref name=Allsopp2007&gt;{{harvnb|Allsopp|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mining ====
{{see also|Environmental impact of mining}}
Mining stream channels for sand and gravel can impact riparian zones by destroying habitat directly, removing groundwater through pumping, altering stream channel morphology, and changing sediment flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Conversely, mining activities in the floodplain can create favorable areas for the establishment of riparian vegetation (e.g., cottonwoods) along streams where natural recruitment processes have been impacted through other forms of human activity.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Mining for metals can impact riparian zones when toxic materials accumulate in sediments.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

==== Invasive exotics ====
The number and diversity of invasive [[Introduced species|exotic species]] in riparian ecosystems is increasing worldwide.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Riparian zones may be particularly vulnerable to invasion due to frequent habitat disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) and the efficiency of rivers and streams in dispersing propagules.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Invasive species can greatly impact the ecosystem structure and function of riparian zones. For example, the higher biomass of dense stands of the invasive Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus species causes greater water consumption and thus lower water levels in streams in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Invasive plants can also cause changes in the amount of sediment that is trapped by vegetation, altering channel morphology, and can increase the flammability of the vegetation, increasing fire frequency.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Exotic animals can also impact riparian zones. For example, feral burros along the [[Santa Maria River (Arizona)|Santa Maria river]] strip bark and cambium off native cottonwoods, causing tree mortality.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

== Methods ==
Methods for restoring riparian zones are often determined by the cause of degradation. Two main approaches are used in riparian-zone restoration: restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features, and reestablishing native riparian vegetation.

=== Restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features ===

When altered flow regimes have impacted riparian zone health, re-establishing natural streamflow may be the best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Bhattacharjee2009 /&gt; However, simply restoring a more natural flow regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996 /&gt;

The negative effects of channelization on stream and riparian health can be lessened through physical restoration of the stream channel.  This can be accomplished by restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997&gt;{{harvnb|Rosgen|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997 /&gt; Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997 /&gt; The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; In addition, stream channel modification can be extremely costly.

One well-known example of a large-scale stream restoration project is the [[Restoration of the Everglades#Kissimmee River|Kissimmee River Restoration Project]] in central Florida. The [[Kissimmee River]] was channelized between 1962 and 1971 for [[flood control]], turning a meandering 167&amp;nbsp;km of river into a 90&amp;nbsp;km drainage canal.&lt;ref name=Whalen2002&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively eliminated seasonal inundation of the floodplain, causing a conversion from wetland to upland communities.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2006&gt;{{harvnb|SFWMD|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A restoration plan began in 1999 with the goals of reestablishing ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2006 /&gt; The project involves dechannelizing major sections of the river, directing water into reconstructed channels, removing water control structures, and changing flow regimes to restore seasonal flooding to the floodplain.&lt;ref name=Whalen2002 /&gt; Since the completion of the first phase of restoration, a number of improvements in vegetation and wildlife communities have been documented as the conversion from uplands back to wetlands has begun to take place.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2009&gt;{{harvnb|SFWMD|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Breaching levees to reconnect streams to their floodplains can be an effective form of restoration as well.  On the [[Cosumnes River]] in central California, for example, the return of seasonal flooding to the floodplain as a result of levee breaching was found to result in the reestablishment of primarily native riparian plant communities.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007&gt;{{harvnb|Trowbridge|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dechannelisation of shorter reach (2&amp;nbsp;km long) and lowered levee are also been proved to be an effective restoration approach together with natural (or near natural) flooding regime in order to improve soil processes spatial and temporal heterogeneity typical of natural floodplains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samaritani|first1=Emanuela|last2=Shrestha|first2= Juna|last3=Fournier|first3=Bertrand|last4=Frossard|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Gillet|first5=François|last6=Guenat|first6=Claire|last7=Niklaus|first7=Pascal A.|last8=Pasquale|first8=Nicola|last9=Tockner|first9=Klement|last10=Mitchell|first10=Edward A.D.|last11=Luster|first11=Jörg|title=Heterogeneity of soil carbon pools and fluxes in a channelized and a restored floodplain section (Thur River, Switzerland)|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|year=2011|volume=15|pages=1757–1769|doi=10.5194/hess-15-1757-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream channels will often recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do not continue to maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found stream channel regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee.&lt;ref name=Hupp1992 /&gt; More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.

=== Restoration of riparian vegetation ===

The revegetation of degraded riparian zones is a common practice in riparian restoration. Revegetation can be accomplished through active or passive means, or a combination of the two.

==== Active vegetation restoration ====
A lack of naturally available propagules can be a major limiting factor in restoration success.&lt;ref name=Young2005&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, actively planting native vegetation is often crucial for the successful establishment of riparian species.&lt;ref name=YoungChaseHuddleston2001&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Chase|Huddleston|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods for actively restoring vegetation include broadcast sowing seed and directly planting seeds, plugs, or seedlings. Reestablishing clonal species such as willows can often be accomplished by simply putting cuttings directly into the ground.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; To increase survival rates, young plants may need to be protected from herbivory with fencing or tree shelters.&lt;ref name=Phillips2007&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preliminary research suggests that direct-seeding woody species may be more cost-effective than planting container stock.&lt;ref name=PalmerleeYoung2010&gt;{{harvnb|Palmerlee|Young|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference sites are often used to determine appropriate species to plant and may be used as sources for seeds or cuttings. Reference communities serve as models for what restoration sites should ideally look like after restoration is complete.&lt;ref name=SER2004&gt;{{harvnb|SER|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about using reference sites have been raised however, as conditions at the restored and reference sites may not be similar enough to support the same species.&lt;ref name=SER2004 /&gt; Also, restored riparian zones may be able to support a variety of possible species combinations, therefore the Society for Ecological Restoration recommends using multiple reference sites to formulate restoration goals.&lt;ref name=SER2004 /&gt;

A practical question in active vegetation restoration is whether certain plants facilitate the recruitment and persistence of other plants (as predicted by theories of succession), or whether initial community composition determines long-term community composition (priority effects).&lt;ref name=Young2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|Ambrose|Poff|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the former applies, it may be more effective to plant facilitative species first, and wait to plant dependent species as conditions become appropriate (e.g., when enough shade is provided by overstory species). If the latter applies, it is probably best to plant all desired species at the outset.&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997 /&gt;

As a critical component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners often have to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is to be done on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;

==== Passive vegetation restoration ====
Active planting of riparian vegetation may be the fastest way to reestablish riparian ecosystems, but methods may be prohibitively resource-intensive.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Riparian vegetation may come back on its own if human-induced disturbances are stopped and/or hydrologic processes are restored.&lt;ref name=OppermanMerenlender2004&gt;{{harvnb|Opperman|Merenlender|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, many studies show that preventing cattle grazing in riparian zones through exclusion fencing can allow riparian vegetation to rapidly increase in robustness and cover, and also shift to a more natural community composition.&lt;ref name=Sarr2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DobkinRichPyle1998&gt;{{harvnb|Dobkin|Rich|Pyle|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By simply restoring hydrologic processes such as periodic flooding that favor riparian vegetation, native communities may regenerate on their own (e.g., the Cosumnes River floodplain).&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007 /&gt; The successful recruitment of native species will depend on whether local or upstream seed sources can successfully disperse propagules to the restoration site, or whether a native seed bank is present.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=YoungChaseHuddleston2001 /&gt; One potential hindrance to passive vegetation restoration is that exotic species may preferentially colonize the riparian zone.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Active weeding may improve the chances that the desired native plant community will reestablish.

=== Restoring animal life ===
Restoration often focuses on reestablishing plant communities, probably because plants form the foundation for other organisms within the community.&lt;ref name=Young2005 /&gt; Restoration of faunal communities often follows the “Field of Dreams” hypothesis: “if you build it, they will come”.&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997 /&gt; Many animal species have been found to naturally recolonize areas where habitat has been restored.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; For example, abundances of several bird species showed marked increases after riparian vegetation had been reestablished in a riparian corridor in Iowa.&lt;ref name=BensonDinsmoreHohman2006&gt;{{harvnb|Benson|Dinsmore|Hohman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some riparian restoration efforts may be aimed at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue elderberry, ''Sambucus mexicana'') as its sole host plant.&lt;ref name=Vaghti2009&gt;{{harvnb|Vaghti|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of riparian vegetation) are important for ensuring restoration success.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

=== Ecosystem perspectives ===
Restoration failures may occur when appropriate ecosystem conditions are not reestablished, such as soil characteristics (e.g., salinity, pH, beneficial soil biota, etc.), surface water and groundwater levels, and flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Therefore, successful restoration may be dependent on taking a number of both biotic and abiotic factors into account. For example, restoration of soil biota, including symbiotic myccorhizae, invertebrates, and microorganisms may improve nutrient cycling dynamics.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;  Restoration of physical processes may be a prerequisite to the reestablishment of healthy riparian communities.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007 /&gt; Ultimately, a combination of approaches taking into account causes for degradation and targeting both hydrology and the reestablishment of vegetation and other life forms may be most effective in riparian zone restoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">The England-wide '''Routes into Languages''' project is a consortium of universities working together with schools and colleges, to enthuse and encourage people to study languages. It is funded by [[HEFCE]], the Higher Education Funding Council for England (£4.5 million) and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (£3.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/index.html About | Routes Into Languages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203093928/https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/index.html |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Routes into Languages aims to increase the take-up for modern foreign languages in English primary and secondary schools, and promote careers in [[translating]] and [[interpreting]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M. (2007 )Attention, s'il vous plaît, ''Times Higher Education Supplement'' http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=209068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipsett, A. (2007) Who Got that cash? ''Times Higher Education Supplement'' http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=208941&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase 2 ( from August 2013 to July 2016) aims at promoting take up in learning languages while strengthening and widening an efficient network of universities, schools and key stakeholders throughout the UK. The theme of international mobility gives rise to a variety of projects and activities, from cultural events and revision days to e-mentoring and tutoring. These collaborations also aim at encouraging students to spend a year abroad during their studies, at widening access to language study and at promoting greater national capacity in the areas of employment that require proficiency in languages and enhance intercultural competence while helping to encourage a broader social profile of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Routes into Languages Programme in England is funded by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] and hosted by the [[Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies]] (LLAS)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">The '''SECS-II''' ('''S'''EMI '''E'''quipment '''C'''ommunications '''S'''tandard, Part '''2'''), sometimes called '''SEMI E5''', is a communication protocol used in the semiconductor industry between devices involved in manufacturing. Much like the protocols in the [[OSI model]], SECS-II is a layer above [[SECS-I]] and [[HSMS]]. While SECS-I and HSMS define how the communications are transmitted (such as over [[RS-232C]] or Ethernet), SECS-II defines the format and content of messages that can be sent over SECS-I or HSMS.

The protocol is maintained by the [[SEMI]] organization, from which copies of the [http://dom.semi.org/downloads.nsf/standard?openform&amp;did=3D7290CC518B3F25882573E1004D1495&amp;sid=0 SEMI E5] standard may be obtained for a fee.

==Usage==

The SECS-II defines the message structure between equipment and host. Most of the SEMI E5 standard is a large library of possible messages – a few of which have redundant functionality with different message structures. Most equipment support only a restricted subset of these messages. Some equipment define custom SECS-II messages that are not part of the SEMI E5 standard.

===Messages===

Only a subset of the possible messages is actually required by the [[SECS/GEM|GEM]] standard. Some SECS-II message transactions may be initiated by only the host. Other [http://www.cimetrix.com/semi-e5-secs-ii.cfm SECS-II] message transactions may be initiated only by an equipment. A few message transactions may be initiated by either the host or equipment. In order for a SECS-II message to be valid, it must be used by the correct party and have the correct message format (the SECS-II message structure defined by E5). The host and equipment can agree to support custom messages to implement custom features whose format is not defined in SEMI E5, but this is highly discouraged when standard message are sufficient. 

The SECS-II messages are organized into categories called streams that are identified by an integer between 0 and 255. Each stream category contains specific messages, or functions, also identified by an integer between 0 and 255. A primary message is an odd-numbered function. A secondary message is the corresponding even numbered function. A request for information and the corresponding data transmission is an example of such an activity. In most transmissions when either the host or equipment sends a primary message, the response is the corresponding secondary message.

Unless the reply bit is clear, a primary message should always be responded to with the complementary secondary message. For most SECS-II messages, a secondary reply message is required. For example, if the host sends an S1,F1 (stream 1, function 1) message to request 'Are you there?', then equipment will send a reply S1,F2 message to indicate 'I am here'. Each SECS-II message exchange has a unique transaction ID number. The standards allow message interleaving where there is more than one open, concurrent transaction.

The SECS-II standard also defines lists of allowed data types including ASCII, binary, boolean, 4 and 8 byte floating points, signed and unsigned integers of byte length 1, 2, 4, or 8 and a List; a container for other data elements including other lists.

SECS-II messages are sent as structured binary data. It is a very efficient means to package information across a network without wasting bandwidth. When using the SECS-I standard, RS-232 serial communication, the message size is limited to 7995148 bytes (about 8 MB). When using the [[HSMS]] standard, TCP/IP network communication, the maximum message size is limited to 4294967295 bytes (about 4.3 GB). The structure of each standard SECS-II message is defined by the SEMI E5 SECS-II standard. A message can be a simple data element, such as a binary response or an ASCII string. A message can also be a complex list structure with multiple levels of lists in the hierarchy. The SECS-II standard limits a single element within a SECS-II message to 16777215 bytes (about 16.5 MB).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8740">In [[project management]], a '''schedule''' is a listing of a [[project]]'s [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]], [[task (project management)|activities]], and [[deliverable]]s, usually with intended start and finish dates.  Those items are often [[Estimation (project management)|estimated]] by other information included in the project schedule of [[resource allocation]], [[budget]], task [[duration (project management)|duration]], and linkages of [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] and scheduled events.  A schedule is commonly  used in the [[project planning]] and [[project portfolio management]] parts of [[project management]].  Elements on a schedule may be closely related to the [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) [[Work breakdown structure#Terminal element|terminal element]]s, the [[Statement of work]], or a [[Contract Data Requirements List]].

==Overview==
In many industries, such as engineering and construction, the development and maintenance of the project schedule is the responsibility of a full-time scheduler or team of schedulers, depending on the size and the scope of the project.  The techniques of scheduling are well developed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF_Papers/P042_History%20of%20Scheduing.pdf A Brief History of Scheduling (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; but inconsistently applied throughout industry.  Standardization and promotion of scheduling best practices are being pursued by the [[Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering]] (AACE), the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; purposes.

Project management is not limited to industry; the average person can use it to organize their own life.  Some examples are:
* Homeowner renovation project
* Keeping track of all the family activities
* Coaching a team
* Planning a vacation
* Planning a wedding

Some project management software programs provide templates, lists, and example schedules to help their users with creating their schedule.

== Methods ==

Before a project schedule can be created, the schedule maker should have a work breakdown structure (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each [[Resource (project management)|resource]]. If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like [[Wideband Delphi]]. The reason for this is that a schedule itself is an estimate: each date in the schedule is estimated, and if those dates do not have the buy-in of the people who are going to do the work, the schedule will be inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, Greene, [http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/content/view/18/38/ Applied Software Project Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624124503/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/content/view/18/38/ |date=2013-06-24 }}  O'Reilly press, Nov 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop a project schedule, the following needs to be completed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.geniusproject.com/guide/beginner-guide-project-scheduling/getting-started
| title = Beginner's Guide to Project Scheduling
| publisher = Genius Project
| accessdate = 15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Project scope
* Sequence of activities
* Tasks grouped into 5 project phases (conception, definition &amp; planning, launch, performance, close)
* Task dependencies map
* [[Critical path analysis]]
* Project milestones

In order for a project schedule to be healthy, the following criteria must be met:&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, Thomas, [http://www.pmhut.com/cultivating-a-healthy-project-schedule Cultivating a Healthy Project Schedule], PM Hut (Last accessed 8 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

* The schedule must be constantly (weekly works best) updated.
* The [[Earned Value Management|EAC (Estimation at Completion)]] value must be equal to the baseline value.
* The remaining effort must be appropriately distributed among [[Project team|team]] members (taking vacations into consideration).

The schedule structure may closely follow and include citations to the index of work breakdown structure or deliverables, using decomposition or templates to describe the activities needed to produce the deliverables defined in the WBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6185">The '''Society of Les Voyageurs''' is a fraternal student organization at the [[University of Michigan]]. It is one of the oldest university [[List of university outing clubs|outing clubs]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~lvs/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1907, the Society of Les Voyageurs is the second oldest [[student organization]] on the University of Michigan campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigandaily.com/content/about-campus-les-voyageurs&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sunday evenings during the academic year, the Society hosts communal dinners known as "Sunday Feeds" along with educational programs and entertainment related to the outdoors.

==History==

The Society of Les Voyageurs was founded in 1907 by University of Michigan students Elmer "Lindy" Lehndorff, Lawrence "Larry" Lark, and Chester MacChesney.  They named the Society after the pioneering [[French-Canadian]] [[voyageurs]] of the [[Great Lakes]] [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], whom they admired as early adventurers and outdoorsmen.  Society membership was initially open only to male students at the University. The Society's Constitution was amended in 1972 to allow for the admission of women, and the Society has been co-ed since that time. The Society has published an annual [[yearbook]] since 1910 as well as several volumes of Society history.

After nearly two decades of renting space on the University of Michigan campus, the Society drew up plans in 1924 to construct a cabin on several acres of property along the Huron River in Ann Arbor.  "Pine Lodge", as it was originally named, was built almost entirely by Society members in the spring and summer of 1925, and has continually served since then as the home for the Society as well as a residence for student members. During the summer of 2012, the renamed Habe Mills Pine Lodge underwent an extensive renovation, including the installation of "Kay's Kitchen."  The new kitchen is named for Kay Lane, a University student in the late 1960s and early 1970s upon whom Society members bestowed the title "Queen of the Cabin," and who ultimately paved the way for the admission of women as full members of the Society.  After graduating from the University of Michigan, Kay remained active in the Society and was a well known friend and mentor to several generations of members.

==2012 Cabin Renovation==
Beginning in the summer of 2012, the cabin underwent a major renovation costing over $100,000. Plans for the renovation had been tossed around for years, and the final plans were made official in early January of that year. Most of the work was contracted out to By The River Carpentry, but many of the actives and alumni were around and gave a helping hand. The renovation consisted of expanding the dining room, adding an upstairs bathroom, re-doing the kitchen, adding in a hallway between the dining room and kitchen and expanding the upstairs lodge. The work was completed in August 2012, and was ready to welcome back students for the 2012 Fall semester. Potlucks continue as normal, but now there is more space to accommodate even more lovely guests.

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable development ties together concern for the [[carrying capacity]] of [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. [[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. [[William Flynn Martin]], David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman [[John Dingell]].{{Citation needed|reason=This is not common historical knowledge and should probably be documented with a secondary source as well.|date=August 2018}}

In 1980 the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.a21italy.it/medias/31C2D26FD81B0D40.pdf|title=World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable Development|date=1980|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the term "sustainable development".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sustainable Development|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780231173155|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4}} Two years later, the [[United Nations]] [[World Charter for Nature]] raised five principles of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=World Charter for Nature|date=28 October 1982|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations, General Assembly, 48th Plenary Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] released the report ''Our Common Future'', commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Brundtland2"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1987|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm|publisher=United Nations|author=[[Brundtland Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development, 2nd edition|last=Smith|first=Charles|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-333-72228-0|location=Basingstoke|pages=|id=|authorlink=Charles Emrys Smith|author2=Rees, Gareth}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pull quote|Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:&lt;br /&gt;· The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and &lt;br /&gt;· The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.|author=[[World Commission on Environment and Development]]|source=''[[Our Common Future]]'' (1987)}}

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/4362669/Reframing_Social_Sustainability_Reporting_Towards_an_Engaged_Approach|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|publisher=University of Melbourne|doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9384-2|author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth. Philadelphia: [[Westminster John Knox Press|Westminster Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in many fields have highlighted ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., D.L. Meadows, J.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996.

One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[Open-source model|open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Deforestation and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon [[wilderness]] areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]
In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

{{use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}
{{More footnotes|date=July 2014}}

In [[computability theory]], a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's [[instruction set]], a [[programming language]], or a [[cellular automaton]]) is said to be '''Turing complete''' or '''computationally universal''' if it can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist [[Alan Turing]]. A classic example is [[lambda calculus]].{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}}

A closely related concept is that of '''Turing equivalence'''{{snd}} two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an [[algorithm]] can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A [[universal Turing machine]] can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;A UTM cannot simulate non-computational aspects such as [[Input/output|I/O]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To show that something is Turing complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system. For example, an [[imperative language]] is Turing complete if it has [[conditional branching]] (''e.g.'', "if" and "goto" statements, or a "branch if zero" instruction; see [[one instruction set computer]]) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of [[computer memory|memory]] (''e.g.'', the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items). Of course, no physical system can have infinite memory; but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing complete.

==Non-mathematical usage==
In [[colloquial]] usage, the terms "Turing complete" or "Turing equivalent" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language.

Real computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine (the "tape" corresponding to their memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough.  However, real computers have limited physical resources, so they are only [[linear bounded automaton]] complete.  In contrast, a [[universal computer]] is defined as a device with a Turing complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available time.

==Formal definitions==
In [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], several closely related terms are used to describe the computational power of a computational system (such as an [[abstract machine]] or [[programming language]]):

;Turing completeness
:A computational system that can compute every Turing-[[computable function]] is called Turing-complete (or Turing-powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a [[universal Turing machine]].
;Turing equivalence
:A Turing-complete system is called Turing equivalent if every function it can compute is also Turing computable; i.e., it computes precisely the same class of functions as do [[Turing machine]]s. Alternatively, a Turing-equivalent system is one that can simulate, and be simulated by, a universal Turing machine. (All known Turing-complete systems are Turing equivalent, which adds support to the [[Church–Turing thesis]].)
;(Computational) universality
:A system is called universal with respect to a class of systems if it can compute every function computable by systems in that class (or can simulate each of those systems). Typically, the term universality is tacitly used with respect to a Turing-complete class of systems. The term "weakly universal" is sometimes used to distinguish a system (e.g. a [[cellular automaton]]) whose universality is achieved only by modifying the standard definition of [[Turing machine]] so as to include input streams with infinitely many 1s.

==History==
Turing completeness is significant in that every real-world design for a computing device can be simulated by a [[universal Turing machine]]. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] states that this is a law of mathematics{{snd}} that a universal Turing machine can, in principle, perform any calculation that any other programmable [[computer]] can. This says nothing about the effort needed to write the [[computer program|program]], or the time it may take for the machine to perform the calculation, or any abilities the machine may possess that have nothing to do with computation.

[[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]] (1830s) would have been the first Turing-complete machine if it had been built at the time it was designed. Babbage appreciated that the machine was capable of great feats of calculation, including primitive logical reasoning, but he did not appreciate that no other machine could do better. From the 1830s until the 1940s, mechanical calculating machines such as adders and multipliers were built and improved, but they could not perform a conditional branch and therefore were not Turing complete.

In the late 19th century, [[Leopold Kronecker]] formulated notions of computability, defining [[primitive recursive functions]]. These functions can be calculated by rote computation, but they are not enough to make a universal computer, because the instructions which compute them do not allow for an infinite loop. In the early 20th century, [[David Hilbert]] led a program to axiomatize all of mathematics with precise axioms and precise logical rules of deduction which could be performed by a machine. Soon, it became clear that a small set of deduction rules are enough to produce the consequences of any set of axioms. These rules were proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1930 to be enough to produce every theorem.

The actual notion of computation was isolated soon after, starting with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. This theorem showed that axiom systems were limited when reasoning about the computation which deduces their theorems. Church and Turing independently demonstrated that Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was unsolvable,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink = Andrew Hodges | origyear = 1983 | year = 1992 | title = [[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] |location = London | publisher=Burnett Books | page = 111 | isbn = 0-04-510060-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus identifying the computational core of the incompleteness theorem. This work, along with Gödel's work on [[general recursive functions]], established that there are sets of simple instructions, which, when put together, are able to produce any computation. The work of Gödel showed that the notion of computation is essentially unique.

In 1941 [[Konrad Zuse]] completed the [[Z3 (computer)]], the first working Turing-complete machine; this was the first digital computer in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3330654_How_to_make_Zuse's_Z3_a_universal_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computability theory==
Computability theory characterizes problems as having, or not having, computational solutions.
The first result of computability theory is that there exist problems for which it is impossible to predict what a (Turing-complete) system will do over an arbitrarily long time. 

The classic example is the [[halting problem]]: create an algorithm which takes as input (a) a program in some Turing-complete language, and (b) some data to be fed to ''that'' program; and which determines whether the program, operating on the input, will eventually stop or will continue forever. It  is trivial to create an algorithm that can do this for ''some'' inputs, but impossible to do this in general. For any characteristic of the program's eventual output, it is impossible to determine whether this characteristic will hold. 

This impossibility poses problems when analyzing real-world computer programs. For example, one cannot write a tool that entirely protects programmers from writing infinite loops, or protects users from supplying input that would cause infinite loops. 

One can instead limit a program to executing only for a fixed period of time ([[Timeout (computing)|timeout]]), or limit the power of flow control instructions (for example, providing only loops that iterate over the items of an existing array). However, another theorem shows that there are problems solvable by Turing-complete languages that cannot be solved by any language with only finite looping abilities (i.e., any language that guarantees every program will eventually finish to a halt). So any such language is not Turing complete. For example, a language in which programs are guaranteed to complete and halt cannot compute the computable function which is produced by [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] on all computable functions in that language.

==Turing oracles==
{{main article|Oracle machine}}

A computer with access to an infinite tape of data may be more powerful than a Turing machine: for instance, the tape might contain the solution to the [[halting problem]], or some other Turing-undecidable problem. Such an infinite tape of data is called a [[Turing oracle]]. Even a Turing oracle with random data is not computable ([[Almost surely|with probability 1]]), since there are only countably many computations but uncountably many oracles. So a computer with a random Turing oracle can compute things that a Turing machine cannot.

==Digital physics==
{{See also|Church–Turing thesis#Philosophical implications}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
All known laws of physics have consequences that are computable by a series of approximations on a digital computer. A hypothesis called [[digital physics]] states that this is no accident, because the [[universe]] itself is computable on a universal Turing machine. This would imply that no computer more powerful than a universal Turing machine can be built physically.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
The computational systems (algebras, calculi) that are discussed as Turing complete systems are those intended for studying [[theoretical computer science]]. They are intended to be as simple as possible, so that it would be easier to understand the limits of computation. Here are a few:
*[[Automata theory]]
*[[Formal grammar]] (language generators)
*[[Formal language]] (language recognizers)
*[[Lambda calculus]]
*[[Post–Turing machine]]s
*[[Process calculus]]
Most [[programming language]]s, conventional and unconventional, are Turing-complete. This includes:
*All general-purpose languages in wide use.
**[[Procedural programming]] languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].
**[[object-oriented programming language|Object-oriented]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Smalltalk]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
**[[multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigm]] languages such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C++]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Object Pascal]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]].
*Most languages using less common paradigms
**[[functional programming|Functional]] languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].
**[[Logic programming]] languages such as [[Prolog]].
**[[declarative programming|Declarative]] languages such as [[XSLT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unidex.com/turing/utm.htm |title=Universal Turing Machine in XSLT |website=B2B Integration Solutions from Unidex |first=Bob |last=Lyons |date=30 March 2001 |accessdate=2010-07-05 |dead-url=no |archive-date=17 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717162708/http://www.unidex.com/turing/utm.htm |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Esoteric programming language]]s, a form of [[mathematical recreation]] in which programmers work out how to achieve basic programming constructs in an extremely difficult but mathematically Turing-equivalent language.

Some [[rewrite system]]s are Turing-complete.

Turing completeness is an abstract statement of ability, rather than a prescription of specific language features used to implement that ability. The features used to achieve Turing completeness can be quite different; [[Fortran]] systems would use loop constructs or possibly even [[goto]] statements to achieve repetition; Haskell and Prolog, lacking looping almost entirely, would use [[recursion]]. Most programming languages are describing computations on von Neumann architectures, which have memory (RAM and register) and a control unit. These two elements make this architecture Turing-complete. Even pure [[functional language]]s are Turing-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Boyer |first1=Robert S. |last2=Moore |first2=J. Strother |title=A Mechanical Proof of the Turing Completeness of Pure Lisp |number=37 |institution=Institute for Computing Science, University of Texas at Austin |date=May 1983 |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/ics-reports/cmp37.pdf |format=PDF |dead-url=no |archive-date=22 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922044624/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/ics-reports/cmp37.pdf |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=NB&gt;The following book provides an introduction for computation models: {{cite book |first1=Thomas |last1=Rauber |first2=Gudula |last2=Rünger |title=Parallel programming: for multicore and cluster systems |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbpAAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing completeness in declarative [[SQL]] is implemented through [[Hierarchical_and_recursive_queries_in_SQL|recursive common table expressions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dfetter |author2=Breinbaas |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/index.php?title=Cyclic_Tag_System&amp;oldid=15106 |title=Cyclic Tag System |website=PostgreSQL wiki |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsurprisingly, procedural extensions to SQL ([[PLSQL]], etc.) are also Turing complete. This illustrates one reason why relatively powerful non-Turing-complete languages are rare: the more powerful the language is initially, the more complex are the tasks to which it is applied and the sooner its lack of completeness becomes perceived as a drawback, encouraging its extension until it is Turing complete.

The untyped [[lambda calculus]] is Turing-complete, but many typed lambda calculi, including [[System F]], are not. The value of typed systems is based in their ability to represent most typical computer programs while detecting more errors.

[[Rule 110]] and [[Conway's Game of Life]], both [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]], are Turing complete.

&lt;!-- You might have seen the article on BoingBoing that says PowerPoint is Turing-complete. Maybe it is, but the BoingBoing article cites a YouTube presentation that was part of SIGBOVIK.

If you want the article to say that Microsoft PowerPoint is Turing-complete, get a better source than something which ultimately points back to SIGBOVIK. --&gt;

== Non-Turing-complete languages ==
Many computational languages exist that are not Turing complete.  One such example is the set of [[regular language]]s, which are generated by [[regular expression]]s and which are recognized by [[finite state machine|finite automata]]. A more powerful but still not Turing-complete extension of finite automata is the category of [[pushdown automaton|pushdown automata]] and [[context-free grammar]]s, which are commonly used to generate parse trees in an initial stage of program [[compiler|compiling]].  Further examples include some of the early versions of the pixel shader languages embedded in [[Direct3D]] and [[OpenGL]] extensions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In [[total functional programming]] languages, such as [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], all functions are total and must terminate. Charity uses a type system and [[control flow|control constructs]] based on [[category theory]], whereas Epigram uses [[dependent type]]s. The [[LOOP (programming language)|LOOP]] language is designed so that it computes only the functions that are [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. All of these compute proper subsets of the total computable functions, since the full set of total computable functions is not [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable]]. Also, since all functions in these languages are total, algorithms for [[recursively enumerable set]]s cannot be written in these languages, in contrast with Turing machines.

Although (untyped) [[lambda calculus]] is Turing-complete, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is not.

===Data languages===
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as [[XML]], [[HTML]], [[JSON]], [[YAML]] and [[S-expression]]s, because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation. These are sometimes referred to as [[markup language]]s, or more properly as "container languages" or "data description languages".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, [[Rule 110]], a Turing-complete cellular automaton, has been successfully implemented in [[CSS 3]], thus proving, to some extent, its Turing completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is CSS Turing complete? |website=Stack Overflow |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biological classification]], especially [[zoology]], the '''type genus''' is the [[genus]] which defines a [[Family (biology)|biological family]] and the root of the family name.

== Zoological nomenclature ==
According to the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], "The name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon is a nominal genus called the 'type genus'; the family-group name is based upon that of the type genus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=63&amp;nfv= ICZN Code Art. 63. "Name-bearing types."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any family-group name must have a type genus (and any genus-group name must have a [[type species]], but any species-group name may, but need not, have one or more type specimens). The type genus for a family-group name is also the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending -idae (for families).

:Example: The family name [[Cricetidae]] has as its type genus the genus ''[[Cricetus]]'' &lt;small&gt;Leske, 1779.&lt;/small&gt;

== Botanical nomenclature ==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], the phrase "type genus" is used, unofficially, as a term of convenience. In the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'' this phrase has no status. The code uses type specimens for ranks up to family, and types are optional for higher ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art10#10.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code does not refer to the genus containing that type as a "type genus".

:Example: "''[[Poa]]'' is the type genus of the family [[Poaceae]] and of the order [[Poales]]" is another way of saying that the names Poaceae and Poales are based on the generic name ''Poa''.

A '''verification condition generator''' is a common sub-component of an automated [[program verifier]] that synthesizes formal verification conditions by analyzing a program's source code using a method based upon [[Hoare logic]]. VC generators may require that the source code contains logical annotations provided by the programmer or the compiler such as pre/post-conditions and loop invariants (a form of [[proof-carrying code]]). VC generators are often coupled with [[SMT solver]]s in the backend of a program verifier. After a verification condition generator has created the verification conditions they are passed to an [[automated theorem prover]], which can then formally prove the correctness of the code.

Methods have been proposed to use the [[operational semantics]] of machine languages to automatically generate verification condition generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=John Matthews |author2= [[J.

{{Ecological economics|Related topics}}

Although related subjects, [[sustainable development]] and [[sustainability]] are different concepts. ''Weak sustainability'' is an idea within [[environmental economics]] which states that '[[human capital]]' can substitute '[[natural capital]]'. It is based upon the work of Nobel Laureate [[Robert Solow]]&lt;ref name="solow74"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=R.M.|title=Intergenerational equity and exhaustible resources|journal=Review of Economic Studies: Symposium of the Economics of Exhaustible Resources|year=1974|pages=29–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=R.M.|title=On the intergenerational allocation of natural resources|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Economics|year=1986|volume=88|issue=1|pages=141–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=R.M.|title=An almost practical step towards sustainability|journal=Resources Policy|year=1993|volume=16|pages=162–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Hartwick,.&lt;ref name="hartwick77"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartwick|first=J.M.|title=Intergenerational equity and the investing of rents from exhaustible resources|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1977|volume=67|issue=5|pages=972–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartwick|first=J.M.|title=Investing returns from depleting renewable resource stocks and intergenerational equity|journal=Economic Letters|year=1978a|volume=1|issue=1|pages=85–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartwick|first=J.M.|title=Substitution among exhaustible resources and intergenerational equity|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=1978b|volume=45|issue=2|pages=347–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to weak sustainability, ''strong sustainability'' assumes that "human capital" and "natural capital" are complementary, but not interchangeable.

This idea received more political attention as sustainable development discussions evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A key landmark was the [[Rio Summit]] in 1992 where the vast majority of nation-states committed themselves to sustainable development. This commitment was demonstrated by the signing of [[Agenda 21]], a global action plan on sustainable development.

Weak sustainability has been defined using concepts like human capital and natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cabeza-Gutes|first=M.|title=The concept of weak sustainability|journal=Ecological Economics|year=1996|volume=17|pages=147–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human (or produced) capital incorporates resources such as infrastructure, labour and knowledge. Natural capital covers the stock of environmental assets such as fossil fuels, biodiversity and other ecosystem structures and functions relevant for [[ecosystem services]]. In very weak sustainability, the overall stock of man-made capital and natural capital remains constant over time. It is important to note that, unconditional substitution between the various kinds of capital is allowed within weak sustainability. This means that natural resources may decline as long as human capital is increased. Examples include the degradation of the ozone layer, tropical forests and coral reefs if accompanied by benefits to human capital. An example of the benefit to human capital could include increased financial profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=N.|title=The Politics of the Environment|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; If capital is left constant over time [[intergenerational equity]], and thus Sustainable Development, is achieved.&lt;ref name="figge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Figge|first=F.|title=Capital Substitutability and Weak Sustainability Revisited: The Conditions for Capital Substitution in the Presence of Risk|journal=Environmental Values|year=2005|volume=14|issue=2|pages=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of weak sustainability could be mining coal and using it for production of electricity. The natural resource coal, is replaced by a manufactured good which is electricity. The electricity is then in turn used to improve domestic life quality (e.g. cooking, lighting, heating, refrigeration and operating boreholes to supply water in some villages) and for industrial purposes (growing the economy by producing other resources using machines that are electricity operated.)

Case studies of weak sustainability in practice have had both positive and negative results. The concept of weak sustainability still attracts a lot of criticism. Some even suggest that the concept of sustainability is redundant. Other approaches are advocated, including ‘social bequests’, which focus the attention away from neoclassical theory altogether.

Strong sustainability assumes that the economic and environmental capital is complementary, but not interchangeable. Strong sustainability accepts there are certain functions that the environment performs that cannot be duplicated by humans or human made capital. The ozone layer is one example of an ecosystem service that is crucial for human existence, forms part of natural capital, but is difficult for humans to duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablemeasures.com/Training/Indicators/WeakStrg.html |accessdate=May 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826053730/http://sustainablemeasures.com/Training/Indicators/WeakStrg.html |archivedate=August 26, 2012 |title=Sustainability continued }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike weak sustainability, strong sustainability puts the emphasis on ecological scale over economic gains. This implies that nature has a right to exist and that it has been borrowed and should be passed on from one generation to the next still intact in its original form.

An example of strong sustainability could be the manufacturing of office carpet tiles from used car tyres. In this scenario, office carpets and other products are manufactured from used motorcar tyres that would have been sent to a landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ted.com/talks/ray_anderson_on_the_business_logic_of_sustainability.html | title=The business logic of sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and theory==

===Capital approach to sustainability and intergenerational equity===
To understand the concept of weak sustainability, it is first necessary to explore the capital approach to sustainability. This is key to the idea of intergenerational equity. This implies that a fair distribution of resources and assets between generations exists. Decision makers, both in theory and practice, need a concept that enables assessment in order to decide if intergenerational equity is achieved. The capital approach lends itself to this task. In this context we must distinguish between the different types of capital. Human capital (e.g. skills, knowledge) and natural capital (e.g. minerals, water) tend to be the most frequently cited examples. Within the concept it is believed that the amount of capital a generation has at its disposal is decisive for its development. A development is then called sustainable when it leaves the capital stock at least unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce, D.W., Barbier, E.B. &amp; Markandya, A.|title=sustainable development: economics and environment in the third world|year=1990|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Hants}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stern|first=D.I.|title=the capital theory approach to sustainability: a critical appraisal|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1997|volume=31|issue=1|pages=145–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable development===
The weak sustainability paradigm stems from the 1970s. It began as an extension of the neoclassical theory of economic growth, accounting for non-renewable natural resources as a factor of production.&lt;ref name="solow74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwick77" /&gt; However, it only really came into the mainstream in the 1990s within the context of sustainable development discourse. At its inception, sustainability was interpreted as a requirement to preserve, intact, the environment as we find it today in all its forms. The [[Brundtland Report]], for example, stated that ‘The loss of plant and animal species can greatly limit the options of future generations. The result is that sustainable development requires the conservation of plant and animal species’.

===Development of theory===
Wilfred Beckerman&lt;ref name="beck94" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckerman |first=Wilfred |title=Sustainable development: is it a useful concept? |journal=Environmental Values |volume=3 |year=1994 |pages=191–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; posits that the absolutist concept of [[sustainable development]] given above is morally repugnant. The largest part of the world's population live in acute poverty. Taking that as well as the acute degradation into account, one could justify using up vast resources in an attempt to preserve certain species from extinction. These species providing no real benefit for society other than a possible value for the knowledge of their continued existence. He argues that such a task would involve using resources that could have instead been devoted to more pressing world concerns. Examples include increasing access to clean drinking water or sanitation in the [[Third World]].

Many environmentalists shifted their attention to the idea of ‘weak’ sustainability.&lt;ref name="beck94"/&gt; This allows for some natural resources to decrease as long as sufficient compensation is provided by increases in other resources. The result usually was an increase in human capital. This compensation is in the form of sustained human welfare. This is illustrated in a well-regarded definition by [[David Pearce (economist)|David Pearce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Pearce (editor)|title=Macmillian Dictionary of Modern Economics|edition=4th|year=1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;the author of numerous works on sustainability. He defines sustainability as implying something about maintaining the level of human welfare (or well-being) so that it may improve, but never declines (or, not more than temporarily). This implies sustainable development will not decrease over time.

Inter-generational equity assumes each following generation has at least as much capital at its disposal as the preceding generation. The idea of leaving capital stock at least unchanged is widely accepted. The question arises, whether or not one form of capital may be substituted by another.&lt;ref name="figge" /&gt; This is the focus of the debate between ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ sustainability, and how intergenerational equity is to be achieved.

It is also important to note that strong sustainability does not share the notion of inter-changeability. Since the nineties, there has been an ardent debate on the substitutability between natural and human-made capital. While "Weak Sustainability" supporters mainly believe that these are substitutable, "Strong Sustainability" followers generally contest the possibility of inter-changeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ees.kuleuven.be/bioecon/projects/index.html?project_id=483&amp;category=0&amp;select_name=ALL&amp;title=&amp;dsyyyy=2013&amp;deyyyy=2014 | title=Division of Bioeconomics - KU Leuven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of governance and policy recommendations==
The implementation of weak sustainability in [[governance]] can be viewed theoretically and practically through Hartwick’s rule.&lt;ref name="hartwick77" /&gt; In resource economics, Hartwick’s rule defines the amount of investment in human capital that is needed to offset declining stocks of non-renewable resources. Solow&lt;ref name="solow74" /&gt; showed that, given a degree of substitutability between human capital and natural capital, one way to design a sustainable consumption program for an economy is to accumulate man-made capital. When this accumulation is sufficiently rapid the effect from the shrinking exhaustible resource stock is countered by the services from the increased human capital stock. Hartwick's rule, is often referred to as "invest resource rents", where ‘rent’ is payment to a factor of production (in this case capital) in excess of that needed to keep it in its present use. This requires that a nation invest all rent earned from exhaustible resources currently extracted.

Later, Pearce and Atkinson&lt;ref name="p&amp;a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=D.W.|author2=Atkinson, G.D. |title=Capital theory and the measurement of sustainable development: an indicator of weak sustainability|journal=Ecological Economics|year=1993|volume=8|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=K|title=Green adjustments to GDP|journal=Resources Policy|year=1994|volume=20|pages=125–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; added to Hartwick’s rule, by setting out a theoretical and empirical measure of net investment in human and natural capital (and later human capital) that became known as genuine savings. Genuine savings measures net changes in produced, natural and human capital stocks, valued in monetary terms.

The aim of [[governance]] therefore should be to keep genuine savings above or equal to zero. In this sense it is similar to [[green accounting]], which attempts to factor environmental costs into the financial results of operations. A key example of this is the [[World Bank]], who now regularly publishes a comparative and comprehensive set of genuine savings estimates for over 150 countries which is called ‘adjusted savings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dietz, S.  |author2=Neumayer, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Economics and the governance of sustainable development. In Governing sustainability. by Adger, N &amp; Jordan, A. 2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weak sustainability in practice==
A prime example of a weak sustainability is the Government Pension Fund of Norway. [[Statoil]] ASA, a state-owned Norwegian oil company invested its surplus profits from petroleum into a pension portfolio to date worth over $325 billion. The oil, a type of natural capital, was exported in vast quantities by Norway. The resultant fund allows for long-lasting income for the population in exchange for a finite resource, actually increasing the total capital available for Norway above the original levels. This example shows how weak sustainability and substitution can be cleverly applied on a national scale, although it is recognised that its applications are very restricted on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The environment write|first=2009|title=Defining sustainability: weak sustainability|url=http://www.environmentwriter.com/archives/tag/weak-sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, Hartwick’s rule would state that the pension fund was sufficient capital to offset the depletion of the oil resources.

A less positive case is that of the small Pacific nation of [[Nauru]]. A substantial phosphate deposit was found on the island in 1900, and now approximately 80% of the island has been rendered uninhabitable after over 100 years of mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gowdy|first=J.M.|author2=McDaniel, C. |title=The physical destruction of Nauru: An example of weak sustainability|journal=Land Economics|year=1999|volume=75|issue=2|pages=33–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with this extraction, Nauru’s inhabitants, over the last few decades of the twentieth century, have enjoyed a high [[per capita income]]. Money from the mining of phosphate enabled the establishment of a trust fund, which was estimated to be as much as $1 billion. However, chiefly as a result of the [[Asian financial crisis]], the trust fund was almost entirely wiped out. This ‘development’ of Nauru followed the logic of weak sustainability, and almost led to complete environmental destruction.&lt;ref name="ayres"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ayres|first1=R.|last2=Van den Bergh|first2=J.|last3=Gowdy|first3= J.|title=Viewpoint: weak versus strong sustainability. centre for the management of environmental resources|year=1998|url=http://www.tinbergen.nl/uvatin/98103.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case presents a telling argument against weak sustainability, suggesting that a substitution of natural for man-made capital may not be reversible in the long-term.

== Criticisms of the strong vs. weak sustainability model ==
{{See also | Ecological economics #Weak and strong sustainability | Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising neoclassical economics (weak versus strong sustainability)}}
Martinez-Allier's address&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinez-Alier|first=J.|title=The environment as a luxury or "too poor to be green"?|journal=Ecological Economics|year=1995|volume=13|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns over the implications of measuring weak sustainability, after results of work conducted by Pearce &amp; Atkinson in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="p&amp;a" /&gt; By their measure, most of the Northern, [[industrialised countries]] are deemed sustainable, as is the world economy as a whole. This point of view can be considered to be flawed since the world would (arguably) not be sustainable if all countries have the resource intensity rate and pollution rate of many industrialised countries. Industrialization does not necessarily equate to sustainability.

According to Pearce and Atkinson’s calculations, the Japanese economy is one of the most sustainable economies in the world. The reason for this is that its saving rate is so high. This trend still remains today and therefore exceeds depreciation on both natural and man-made capital. Thus, they suggest that it is the gross negligence of factors other than savings in measuring sustainability that makes weak sustainability an inappropriate concept.

The integrative sustainability model has the economy completely located within society and society completely located within the environment. In other words, the economy is a subset of society and society is completely dependent upon the environment. This interdependence means that any sustainability-related issue must be considered holistically. [[File:Nested sustainability-v2.svg|thumb|250px|A [[Euler diagram|diagram]] indicating the relationship between the three pillars of sustainability, suggesting that both economy and [[society]] are constrained by environmental limits&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cato, M. (2009). ''Green Economics''. London: [[Earthscan]], pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-571-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Other inadequacies of the paradigm include the difficulties in measuring savings rates and the inherent problems in quantifying the many different attributes and functions of the biophysical world in monetary terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vatn, A.  |author2=Bromley, D. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Choices without prices without apologies|journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|year=1994|volume=26|pages=125–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; By including all human and biophysical resources under the same heading of ‘capital’, the depleting of fossil fuels, reduction of biodiversity and so forth, are potentially compatible with sustainability. As Gowdy &amp; O'Hara&lt;ref name="gowdy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gowdy|first=J.|author2=O' Hara, S.|title=Weak sustainability and viable technologies|journal=Ecological Economics|year=1997|volume=22|issue=3|pages=239–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; so aptly put it, "As long as the criterion of weak sustainability is met, with savings outstripping capital depletion, there is no conflict between the destruction of species and ecosystems or the depletion of fossil fuels, and the goal of sustainability."

Opposing weak sustainability, strong sustainability supporters contend that we need "a more small-scale decentralized way of life based upon greater self-reliance, so as to create a social and economic system less destructive towards nature." Strong sustainability does not make allowances for the substitution of human, and human made capital for Earth's land, water, and their biodiversity. The products created by mankind cannot replace the natural capital found in ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://2ndgreenrevolution.com/2010/09/26/the-difference-between-weak-and-strong-sustainability/ | title=2ndgreenrevolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critical weakness of the concept is related to environmental resilience.  According to Van Den Bergh,&lt;ref name="vdb"&gt;{{cite book|author=Van den Bergh, J.|year= 2007|title=Handbook of Sustainable Development (Atkinson, G., Dietz, S. &amp; Neumayer, E.)|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham}}&lt;/ref&gt; resilience can be considered as a global, structural stability concept, based on the idea that multiple, locally stable ecosystems can exist. Sustainability can thus be directly related to resilience. With this in mind, weak sustainability can cause extreme sensitivity to either natural disturbances (such as diseases in agriculture with little crop diversity) or economic disturbances (as outlined in the case study of Nauru above). This high level of sensitivity within regional systems in the face of external factors brings to attention an important inadequacy of weak sustainability.&lt;ref name="vdb" /&gt;

== Rejection of both weak and strong models ==
Some critics have gone one step further, dismissing the entire concept of sustainability. Beckerman’s influential work concludes that weak sustainability is, “redundant and illogical”.&lt;ref name="beck94" /&gt; He holds that sustainability only makes sense in its 'strong' form, but that "requires subscribing to a morally repugnant and totally impracticable objective." He goes as far to say that he regrets so much time has been wasted on the entire concept of sustainable development. Contradictorily, it could be argued that even weak sustainability measures are better than having no measures or action at all.

Others have suggested a better approach to sustainability would be that of "social bequests". This change would "free us from a 'zero-sum' game in which our gain is an automatic loss for future generations".&lt;ref name="bromley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bromley|first=D.|title=Searching for sustainability: the poverty of spontaneous order|journal=Ecological Economics|year=1998|volume=24|pages=231–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social bequest approach looks at the problem in a different light by changing to what, rather than how much, we leave to future generations. When the problem is phrased as ‘how much’ this always implies that some amount of a resource should be used and some left. Daniel Bromley&lt;ref name="bromley" /&gt; uses the example of rainforests to illustrate his argument. If we decide to use 25% of a rainforest and leave the rest, but then the next time we make a decision we start all over again and use 25% of what’s left, and so on, eventually there will be no rainforest left. By focusing on bequests of specific rights and opportunities for future generations, we can remove ourselves from the "straightjacket of substitution and marginal tradeoffs of neoclassical theory".&lt;ref name="ayres" /&gt;

'''Wikispecies''' is a [[wiki]]-based online project supported by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its aim is to create a comprehensive [[free content]] catalogue of all [[species]]; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. [[Jimmy Wales]] stated that editors are not required to [[fax]] in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Calling all taxonomists |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5712 |pages=1021 |doi=10.1126/science.307.5712.1021a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiSpecies |newspaper=[[American Scientist|American Scientist Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430034914/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |archivedate=30 April 2005 |date=25 April 2005 |publisher=Sigma Xi |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikispecies is available under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] and [[Creative Commons licenses|CC BY-SA 3.0]].

Started in September 2004, with [[biologist]]s across the world invited to contribute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first=Mark |last=Peplow |year=2005 |title=Species list reaches half-million mark |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project had grown a framework encompassing the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] with links to [[Wikipedia]] articles on individual species by April 2005.&lt;ref name=AS /&gt;

== History ==
[[:species:User:Benedikt|Benedikt Mandl]] co-ordinated the efforts of several people who are interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in early summer 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted, some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Mandl defined two major tasks:
# Figure out how the contents of the data base would need to be presented—by asking experts, potential non-professional users and comparing that with existing databases
# Figure out how to do the software, which hardware is required and how to cover the costs—by asking experts, looking for fellow volunteers and potential sponsors

Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of a Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged to a sister project of Wikimedia Foundation on September 14, 2004.
* On October 10, 2006, the project exceeded 75,000 articles.
* On May 20, 2007, the project exceeded 100,000 articles with a total of 5,495 registered users.
* On September 8, 2008, the project exceeded 150,000 articles with a total of 9,224 registered users.
* On October 23, 2011, the project reached 300,000 articles.
* On June 16, 2014, the project reached 400,000 articles.
* On January 7, 2017, the project reached 500,000 articles.
* On October 30, 2018, the project reached 600,000 articles, and a total of 1.12 million pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics Wikispecies statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikispecies comprises taxon pages, and additionally pages about synonyms, taxon authorities, taxonomical publications, and institutions or repositories holding type specimen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikispecies:Page_types Wikispecies psge types]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zipf's law''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ɪ|f}}) is an [[empirical law]] formulated using [[mathematical statistics]] that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the [[physical science|physical]] and [[social science|social]] sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete [[power law]] [[probability distribution]]s.  ''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.

For example, Zipf's law states that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gençay|pages=133–153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

The law is named after the American [[linguistics|linguist]] [[George Kingsley Zipf]] (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it.&lt;ref name=Powers1998&gt;{{cite journal| last = Powers | first = David M W| url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1218 |title=Applications and explanations of Zipf's law| year = 1998| conference = Joint conference on new methods in language processing and computational natural language learning| pages = 151–160| publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French stenographer [[Jean-Baptiste Estoup]] (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D.

The same relationship occurs in many other rankings unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, ranks of number of people watching the same TV channel,&lt;ref&gt;M.

Suggests a heterogeneous Zipf-law TV channel-selection model&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1913"/&gt; Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.&lt;ref name="Clausetetal2009"&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C. R., &amp; Newman, M. E. J. (2009). Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data. SIAM Review, 51(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111&lt;/ref&gt; When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent ''s'' = 1.07; i.e. the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; largest settlement is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^{1.07}}&lt;/math&gt; the size of the largest settlement.

==Theoretical review==
Zipf's law is most easily observed by [[graph of a function|plotting]] the data on a [[log-log]] graph, with the axes being [[logarithm|log]] (rank order) and log (frequency). For example, the word ''"the"'' (as described above) would appear at ''x'' = log(1), ''y'' = log(69971). It is also possible to plot reciprocal rank against frequency or reciprocal frequency or interword interval against rank.&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt; The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is [[linear equation|linear]].

Formally, let:
* ''N'' be the number of elements;
* ''k'' be their rank;
* ''s'' be the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.
Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of ''N'' elements, the normalized frequency of elements of rank ''k'', ''f''(''k'';''s'',''N''), is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1/k^s}{\sum\limits_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Zipf's law holds if the number of elements with a given frequency is a random variable with power law distribution &lt;math&gt;p(f) = \alpha f^{-1-1/s}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Adamic2000&gt;Adamic, Lada A. (2000) [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html "Zipf, Power-laws, and Pareto - a ranking tutorial", originally published at http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/ranking/ranking.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026062626/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this representation of Zipf's law is more suitable for statistical testing, and in this way it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Moreno-Sánchez|first = I|last2 = Font-Clos|first2 = F|last3 = Corral|first3 = A|date = 2016|title = Large-Scale Analysis of Zipf’s Law in English Texts|url =|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0147073|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example of the frequency of words in the English language, ''N'' is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the exponent ''s'' is 1. ''f''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.

The law may also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H&lt;sub&gt;N,s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].

The simplest case of Zipf's law is a "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; function." Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur ½ as often as the first.  The third most common frequency will occur ⅓ as often as the first. The fourth most common frequency will occur ¼ as often as the first. The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most common frequency will occur &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.

In human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.

As long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}&lt;\infty. \!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ζ'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].

Although Zipf’s Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO’S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF’S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102–108 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the reason is still not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Brillouin]], ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', 1959, réédité en 1988, traduction anglaise rééditée en 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the "words" follow the general trend of Zipf's law (appearing approximately linear on log-log plot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wentian Li |title=Random Texts Exhibit Zipf's-Law-Like Word Frequency Distribution |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=38 |issue=6 |year=1992 |pages=1842–1845 |doi=10.1109/18.165464 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527030629/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vitold Belevitch]] in a paper, ''On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution'' offered a mathematical derivation.  He took a large class of well-behaved [[statistical distribution]]s (not only the [[normal distribution]]) and expressed them in terms of rank. He then expanded each expression into a [[Taylor series]]. In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first-order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law|Mandelbrot's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G.

The [[principle of least effort]] is another possible explanation:
Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" or "success breeds success") that results in the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610173330/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and population versus city rank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610203644/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.

==Related laws==

[[Image:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|left|320px|A plot of word frequency in Wikipedia (November 27, 2006). The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&amp;nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of the word’s occurrences. Most popular words are "the", "of" and "and", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&amp;nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]

''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data," in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''ζ''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with "zeta distribution," since probability distributions are sometimes called "laws". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.

A generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;N,q,s)=\frac{[\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The "constant" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt;

Zipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.&lt;ref name="Adamic2000"/&gt;

The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=A. W. Kemp  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-54897-9|ref=harv}}, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is analogous to the continuous [[Pareto distribution]] in the same way that the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] is analogous to the [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]].

The tail frequencies of the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] are approximately

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;\rho) \approx \frac{[\text{constant}]}{k^{\rho+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

for any choice of ''ρ'' &gt; 0.

In the [[parabolic fractal distribution]], the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship.&lt;ref name="Galien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |title=Factorial randomness: the Laws of Benford and Zipf with respect to the first digit distribution of the factor sequence from the natural numbers |author=Johan Gerard van der Galien |date=2003-11-08 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305150334/http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |archivedate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Eftekhari (2006) Fractal geometry of texts. ''Journal of Quantitative Linguistic'' 13(2-3): 177–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Benford's law]] is a special bounded case of Zipf's law,&lt;ref name="Galien"/&gt; with the connection between these two laws being explained by  their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;L.

== Applications ==
In [[information theory]], a symbol (event, signal) of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt; [[bit]]s of information. Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(x) \approx 1/x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent with number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into information already stored in a natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we should go to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x') \approx \log_2(x) + \log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, in standard binary system we would have &lt;math&gt;x' = 2x + s&lt;/math&gt;, what is optimal for &lt;math&gt;\Pr(s=0) = \Pr(s=1) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; probability distribution. Using &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt; rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.

Zipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |author-link1= |date=2016 |publisher= |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21–25, |location=Portorož, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |id= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
