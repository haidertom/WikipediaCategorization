The '''accelerating expansion of the universe''' is the observation that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[universe]] is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-20180311"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Donna |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=Measuring universe expansion reveals mystery – Is something unpredicted going on in the depths of space? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/measuring-universe-expansion-reveals-mystery |date=11 March 2018 |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory evidence has been found in [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its [[dark-energy-dominated era]] roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frieman |first=Joshua A. |last2=Turner |first2=Michael S. |last3=Huterer |first3=Dragan |year=2008 |title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=385–432 |arxiv=0803.0982 |bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |1=&lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}. The evolution of the scale factor is controlled by the dominant energy form: {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''w'')}} (for constant {{mvar|w}}). During the radiation-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; during the matter-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and for the dark energy-dominated era, assuming {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}, asymptotically {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ exp(''Ht'')}}."&lt;br /&gt;
p. 44: "Taken together, all the current data provide strong evidence for the existence of dark energy; they constrain the fraction of critical density contributed by dark energy, 0.76&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.02, and the equation-of-state parameter, {{mvar|w}}&amp;nbsp;≈ −1&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (stat) ±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (sys), assuming that {{mvar|w}} is constant.

These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}}
Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

==Background==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{further|Cosmological constant|Lambda-CDM model|Hubble's law|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann equations}}
In the decades since the detection of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) in 1965,&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A. A. |last2=Wilson |first2=R. W. |date=1965 |title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080&amp;nbsp;Mc/s |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=419–421 |bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P |doi=10.1086/148307}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Bang]] model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] defines how the [[energy]] in the universe drives its expansion.

:&lt;math&gt; H^2={\left ( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right )}^2=\frac{8{\pi}G}{3}\rho-\frac{{\Kappa}c^2}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Κ}} represents the [[curvature of the universe]], {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the total energy density of the universe, and {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hubble parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemiroff |first1=Robert J. |authorlink1=Robert J. Nemiroff |last2=Patla |first2=Bijunath |title=Adventures in Friedmann cosmology: A detailed expansion of the cosmological Friedmann equations |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1119/1.2830536 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703739 |bibcode=2008AmJPh..76..265N |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define a [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8{\pi}G} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[density parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;

We can then rewrite the Hubble parameter as

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

===Alternative theories===

There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/164008 |volume=28 |issue=16 |title=Backreaction: directions of progress |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |pages=164008 |arxiv=1102.0408 |bibcode=2011CQGra..28p4008R |last1=Räsänen |first1=Syksy |last2=Ratra |first2=Bharat |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104435 |volume=62 |issue=1 |title=Backreaction in Late-Time Cosmology |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |pages=57–79 |arxiv=1112.5335 |bibcode=2012ARNPS..62...57B |last1=Buchert |first1=Thomas |last2=Räsänen |first2=Syksy |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen:&lt;ref name="NS2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11498-is-dark-energy-an-illusion/ |title=Is dark energy an illusion? |date=2007 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title=Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue=25 |page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W |arxiv=0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony |author6=Sussman, Roberto |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2008 |arxiv=0708.2943 |bibcode=2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=42 |title=Dark energy as a mirage |issue=3 |pages=567–599 |year=2010 |arxiv=0711.4264 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42..567M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clifton |first=Timothy |author2=Ferreira, Pedro |date=April 2009 |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=300 |issue=4 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0409-48 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |pmid=19363920 |bibcode=2009SciAm.300d..48C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the [[equivalence principle]] to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13214">'''Balanced audio''' is a method of interconnecting audio equipment using [[balanced line]]s.  This type of connection is very important in [[sound recording]] and production because it allows the use of long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise caused by electromagnetic interference.

Balanced connections typically use shielded twisted-pair cable and three-conductor connectors. The connectors are usually [[XLR connector|XLR]] or  [[Phone connector (audio)|TRS phone]] connectors. When used in this manner, each cable carries one channel, therefore stereo audio (for example) would require two of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aviom.com/blog/balanced-vs-unbalanced/|title=What’s the Difference Between Balanced and Unbalanced?|date=2014-03-27|work=Aviom Blog|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Many microphones operate at low voltage levels and some with high [[output impedance]] (hi-Z), which makes long microphone cables especially susceptible to [[electromagnetic interference]]. Microphone interconnections are therefore a common application for a balanced interconnection, which cancels out most of this induced noise. If the [[power amplifier]]s of a [[public address system]] are located at any distance from the [[mixing console]], it is also normal to use balanced lines for the signal paths from the mixer to these amplifiers. Many other components, such as graphic equalizers and effects units, have balanced inputs and outputs to allow this. In recording and for short cable runs in general, a compromise is necessary between the noise reduction given by balanced lines and the cost introduced by the extra [[Electronic circuit|circuitry]] they require.

== Interference reduction ==

Balanced audio connections use a number of techniques to reduce noise. 

A typical balanced cable contains two identical wires, which are twisted together and then wrapped with a third conductor (foil or braid) that acts as a [[Shielded cable|shield]]. The two wires form a circuit carrying the [[audio signal]]; one wire is in phase with respect to the source signal, the other wire is reversed in polarity. The in-phase wire is called non-inverting, positive or "hot" while the out-of-phase wire is called inverting, phase-inverted, anti-phase, negative or "cold". The hot and cold connections are often shown as In+ and In− ("in plus" and "in minus") on circuit diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvKPEFu2PVkC&amp;pg=PA344 |page=344 |last=Self |first=Douglas |title=Small Signal Audio Design |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US |year=2010 |isbn=0240521773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kabel-Symetrisch.png|thumb|right]]

The term "balanced" comes from the method of connecting each wire to identical [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at [[source impedance|source]] and [[load impedance|load]].  This means that much of the electromagnetic interference&lt;!-- predominantly capacitive? --&gt; will induce an equal noise voltage in each wire.  Since the amplifier at the far end measures the [[subtraction|difference]] in voltage between the two signal lines, noise that is identical on both wires is rejected.  The noise received in the second, inverted line is applied against the first, upright signal, and cancels it out when the two signals are subtracted. 

This differential signal recombination can be implemented with a [[differential amplifier]].  A [[balun]] may also be used instead of an active differential amplifier device.

The wires are also twisted together, to reduce interference from [[electromagnetic induction]].  A [[twisted pair]] makes the loop area between the conductors as small as possible, and ensures that a magnetic field that passes equally through adjacent loops will induce equal levels of noise on both lines, which is canceled out by the differential amplifier.  If the noise source is extremely close to the cable, then it is possible it will be induced on one of the lines more than the other, and it won't be canceled as well, but canceling will still occur to the extent of the amount of noise that is equal on both lines.

The separate shield of a balanced audio connection also yields a [[noise rejection]] advantage over an unbalanced two-conductor arrangement (such as used in typical [[hi-fi|home stereos]]) where the shield must also act as the signal return wire.  Any noise currents induced into a balanced audio shield will not therefore be directly modulated onto the signal, whereas in a two-conductor system they will be.  This also prevents [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems, by separating the shield/chassis from signal ground.

== Differential signaling ==

Signals are often transmitted over balanced connections using the [[differential signaling|differential mode]], meaning the wires carry signals of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] to each other (for instance, in an [[XLR connector]], pin 2 carries the signal with normal polarity, and pin 3 carries an inverted version of the same signal). Despite popular belief, this arrangement is not necessary for noise rejection.  As long as the impedances are balanced, noise will couple equally into the two wires (and be rejected by a differential amplifier), regardless of the signal that is present on them.&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A simple method of driving a balanced line is to inject the signal into the "hot" wire through a known [[source impedance]], and connect the "cold" wire to the signal's local ground reference through an identical impedance.  Due to common misconceptions about differential signalling, this is often referred to as a &lt;em&gt;quasi-balanced&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;impedance-balanced&lt;/em&gt; output, though it is, in fact, fully balanced and will reject common-mode interference. 

However, there are some minor benefits to driving the line with a fully differential output:
* The electromagnetic field around a differential line is ideally zero, which reduces [[crosstalk]] ''into'' adjacent cables, useful for telephone pairs.
* Though the signal level would not be changed due to [[nominal level]] standardization, the maximum output from the differential drivers is twice as much, giving 6&amp;nbsp;dB extra [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]].&lt;ref name="Blyth"/&gt;
*Increasing cable capacitance over long cable runs decreases the signal level at which high frequencies are attenuated. If each wire carries half the signal voltage swing as in fully differential outputs then longer cable runs can be used without the loss of high frequencies.
* Noise that is correlated between the two amps (from imperfect [[power supply rejection]], for instance), would be cancelled out.
* At higher frequencies, the output impedance of the output amplifier can change, resulting in a small imbalance.  When driven in differential mode by two identical amplifiers, this impedance change will be the same for both lines, and thus cancelled out.&lt;ref name="Blyth"/&gt;
* Differential drivers are also more forgiving of incorrectly wired adapters or equipment that unbalances the signal by shorting pin 2.&lt;ref name="Blyth"/&gt;

==Internally balanced audio design==

Most audio products (recording, public address, etc.) provide differential balanced inputs and outputs, typically via [[XLR connector|XLR]] or [[Phone connector (audio)|TRS phone connector]]s. However, in most cases, a differential balanced input signal is internally converted to a single-ended signal via [[transformer]] or electronic [[amplifier]]. After internal processing, the single-ended signal is converted back to a differential balanced signal and fed to an output.

A small number of audio products have been designed with an entirely differential balanced signal path from input to output; the audio signal never unbalances. This design is achieved by providing identical (mirrored) internal signal paths for both the "non-inverting" and "inverting" audio signals. In critical applications, a 100% differential [[balanced circuit]] design can offer better [[signal integrity]] by avoiding the extra amplifier stages or [[transformer]]s required for front-end unbalancing and back-end rebalancing. Fully balanced internal circuitry has been promoted as yielding 3&amp;nbsp;dB better dynamic range, as explained above,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/m201/ ''Grace Design m201'' (promotional ad copy)] [[Sweetwater Sound]]&lt;/ref&gt; though at increased cost over single-ended designs.

3-pin [[XLR connector]]s and quarter-inch (¼" or 6.35 mm) [[Phone connector (audio)|TRS phone connectors]] are commonly used for balanced audio signals. Many jacks are now designed to take either XLR or TRS phone plugs. Equipment intended for long-term installation sometimes uses [[Screw terminal|terminal strips]] or [[Euroblock]] connectors.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Xlr-connectors.jpg|3-pin XLR connectors, female on left and male on right
Image:XLR-phone jack combo connector.jpg|3-pin XLR + 6.35 mm TRS phone hybrid jack.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

With XLR connectors, pins 1, 2, and 3 are usually used for the shield ([[Ground (electricity)|earthed]] or [[chassis]]), the non-inverting signal, and the inverting signal, respectively. (The phrase "ground, live, return", corresponding to "X, L, R", is often offered as a memory aid, although the inverting signal is not simply a "return.")  On TRS phone plugs, the tip is non-inverting, the ring is inverting, and the sleeve is ground. 

If a [[stereophonic]] or other [[binaural recording|binaural]] signal is plugged into such a jack, one channel (usually the right) will be subtracted from the other (usually the left), leaving an unlistenable  L − R (left minus right) signal instead of normal [[Monaural|monophonic]] L + R.  Reversing the [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] at any other point in a balanced audio system will also result in this effect at some point when it is later mixed-down with its other channel.

[[Telephone line]]s also carry balanced audio, though this is generally now limited to the [[local loop]].  It is called this because the two wires form a balanced loop through which both sides of the [[telephone call]] travel. Note that the telephone line is balanced for AC (audio) signals but is actually unbalanced at DC, as one wire is fed from the exchange power bus, typically -50 volts, and the other grounded, both via equal value inductors which have about 400 ohms DC resistance, to avoid short-circuiting the wanted AC signal while transmitting DC power to the telephone and allowing simple on/off hook detection. 

[[Digital audio]] connections in professional environments are also frequently balanced, normally following the [[AES3]] (AES/EBU) standard. This uses XLR connectors and twisted-pair cable with 110-ohm impedance. By contrast, the coaxial [[S/PDIF]] interface commonly seen on consumer equipment is an unbalanced signal. {{seealso|AES3}}

==Converters==
Unbalanced signals can be converted to balanced signals by the use of a [[balun]], often through a [[DI unit]] (also called a "DI box" or "direct box"). 

If balanced audio must be fed into an unbalanced connection, the electronic design used for the balanced output stage must be known. In most cases the negative output can be tied to ground, but in certain cases the negative output should be left disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rane.com/note151.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''baryon asymmetry''' problem, also known as the '''matter asymmetry''' problem or the '''matter-antimatter asymmetry''' problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The matter-antimatter asymmetry problem | website=CERN | url=https://home.cern/topics/antimatter/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem | accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mystery of the Matter Asymmetry | author=Sather, Eric | website=Vanderbuilt University | url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/panvini/babar/sakharov.pdf | accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the observed imbalance in [[baryonic matter]] (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and [[antibaryonic matter]] in the [[observable universe]]. Neither the [[Standard Model|standard model]] of [[particle physics]], nor the theory of [[general relativity]] provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe be neutral with all conserved [[charge (physics)|charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Particle and astroparticle physics |first=Utpal |last=Sarkar |pages=429 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=1-58488-931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Bang]] should have produced equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]]. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for [[matter]] and [[antimatter]].
Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in [[baryogenesis]]. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, "The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics."&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse/&gt;

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

===Baryon number violation===
Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

===CP-Symmetry Violation===
{{Main|CP violation}}
The second condition for generating baryon asymmetry&amp;nbsp;– violation of charge-parity symmetry&amp;nbsp;– is that a process is able to happen at a different rate to its antimatter counterpart. In the [[Standard Model]], CP violation appears as a complex phase in the [[CKM matrix|quark mixing matrix]] of the [[weak interaction]]. There may also be a non-zero CP-violating phase in the [[PMNS matrix|neutrino mixing matrix]], but this is currently unmeasured. CP violation was first observed in the 1964 [[Fitch-Cronin experiment]] with neutral [[kaon]]s, which resulted in the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].  Despite the allowance for CP-violation in the Standard Model, it is insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe given the limits on baryon number violation, meaning that [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|beyond-Standard Model]] sources are needed.

A possible new source of CP violation was found at the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] by the [[LHCb experiment|LHCb]] collaboration during the first three years of LHC operations (beginning March 2010). The experiment analyzed the decays of two particles, the [[Lambda baryon|bottom Lambda]] (Λ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and its antiparticle, and compared the distributions of decay products. The data showed an asymmetry of up to 20% of CP-violation sensitive quantities, implying a breaking of CP-symmetry. This analysis will need to be confirmed by more data from subsequent runs of the LHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/01/new-source-asymmetry-between-matter-and-antimatter|title=New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions out of thermal equilibrium===
In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author1=A. Riotto |author2=M. Trodden | year = 1999
 | title = Recent progress in baryogenesis
 | journal = [[Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science]]
 | volume = 49 | pages = 46
 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nucl.49.1.35
|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

==Other explanations==
===Regions of the universe where antimatter dominates===
Another possible explanation of the apparent baryon asymmetry is that matter and antimatter are essentially separated into different, widely separated regions of the [[universe]]. The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. Along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions, however, annihilation (and the subsequent production of [[gamma radiation]]) would be detectable, depending on its distance and the density of matter and antimatter. Such boundaries, if they exist, would likely lie in deep intergalactic space. The density of matter in intergalactic space is reasonably well established at about one atom per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Keay |last2=Smoot |first2=George |author2link=George Smoot |title=Wrinkles in Time |publisher=Avon |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0061344443 |pages=158–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silk |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Silk |title=Big Bang |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |year=1977 |page=299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLwe1lUmz5kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming this is a typical density near a boundary, the gamma ray luminosity of the boundary interaction zone can be calculated. No such zones have been detected, but 30 years of research have placed bounds on how far they might be. On the basis of such analyses, it is now deemed unlikely that any region within the observable universe is dominated by antimatter.&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse&gt;{{cite journal|first=L. |last=Canetti |first2=M. |last2=Drewes |first3=M. |last3=Shaposhnikov |title=Matter and Antimatter in the Universe |journal=New J. Phys. |year=2012 |volume=14 |pages=095012 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 |arxiv = 1204.4186 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14i5012C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attempt to explain the lack of observable interfaces between matter and antimatter dominated regions is that they are separated by a [[Leidenfrost effect|Leidenfrost]] layer of very hot matter created by the energy released from annihilation. This is similar to the manner in which water may be separated from a hot plate by a layer of evaporated vapor, delaying the evaporation of more water.

===Electric dipole moment===
The presence of an [[electric dipole moment]] (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter-antimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints on the amount of symmetry violation that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of [[thorium monoxide]] (ThO) molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The ACME Collaboration |title=Order of Magnitude Smaller Limit on the Electric Dipole Moment of the Electron |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=269 |pages=269–72 |date=17 January 2014 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/269.full |doi=10.1126/science.1248213 |display-authors=etal |pmid=24356114|bibcode = 2014Sci...343..269B |arxiv=1310.7534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baryon asymmetry parameter==
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Biography ==
Beatriz González was born in [[Bucaramanga]], Colombia in 1938. She has described herself as always loving art and drawing a lot, but never thinking that would end up being her profession. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in architecture school, but she dropped out only a few years later.  González ended up enrolling in [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)]], graduating from their fine arts department in 1962.

González grew up in Colombia during the 1940s and 50s which was a very dark time in the history of Colombia. The country was plagued with violence and war that was due to the social and political upheaval that is known as [[La Violencia]]. Growing up during this time largely influenced González's understanding of Colombia society, and eventually even her artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Beatriz González  {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
González has drawn inspiration for her art from many different sources, specifically naming [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Antonio Molinari]] as inspirations when it comes to the use of colors and shapes.

Although González is often thought of and referred to as an artist of the pop art movement, she has never considered herself a pop artist. She often thought that the pop movement was not present in her preferred medium of painting and that it wouldn't be an appropriate label for the work she was doing. When asked if she had at any point considered herself a pop artist she responded with, "I’ve always considered myself more of a painter and within this remit I painted the joy of the underdeveloped. For me the type of art that I was doing could only circulate internationally as a curiosity. Mine was a provincial type of art without horizons, confronting the everyday: art is international."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-interview/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Artist interview: Beatriz González {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that all of the art she has done isn't "Pop", but in fact art that is a homage to her hometown of Bucaramanga and reflects its bold colors.

She has oftentimes been acknowledged for being a woman in a movement and country where a great deal of her peers were men, according to González, this has never been a problem for her and credits [[Marta Traba]] for encouraging the presence of woman in the Colombian art scene and states that she doesn't believe in the complex of the female artist who must be victimized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1965 González created a painting entitled ''The Suicides of Sisga'', the painting was based on a picture of a young couple that had been published in a local newspaper after they jumped off the dam of the river Sisga in order to preserve the purity of their love. This work was initially refused at the 1965 Salon of Colombian Artists, disregarded and brushed off by the Jury as a "bad Botero". After one of González's friends and mentors, [[Marta Traba]] pressed the Jury to reconsider their decision, the painting was not only accepted, but Gonzáles won a special prize for her work, that eventually helped launch her career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This painting is now known to reflect the impact of sensationalism of the national press of the creation of popular myths.

After accompanying her husband who is an architect to a hardware store in the 1970s, she began her work on various pieces of store-bought furniture that would generally be found in middle-class households earlier in the century. Typically she would take her images from well known Italian Renaissance and history paintings, or pictures from the present day news media, transferring these images onto cheap nightstands, chairs, coffee tables and beds painted by an amateur painter. She carefully coordinated her images with the furniture's function, such as painting the popes face on nightstands, conjuring up devotional images commonly found over beds or on nightstands in the average Colombian household.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 González's work took a dramatic stylistic shift from its vibrant colors and shapes, to more dark imagery. This was after the M-19 guerrilla attack on the [[Palace of Justice siege|Palace of Justice]] in an attempt to try to president, they left 94 dead. Feeling that she couldn't laugh after that event, she began to explore themes of death and the drug trade as well as exploring some of Colombia's most tragic events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Individual artworks ==

=== The Suicides of Sisga I, II and III ===
One of González's most well known and earliest works depicts a young couple standing holding hands with one other and a bouquet of flowers with a slight smile on their faces. This painting was based off a photo that originally appeared in the press of a couple who commissioned a professional photographer to take their portrait before jumping off the dam of the Sisga on the outskirts of Bogotá. The couple were two young farmers who were deeply in love, but in an effort to preserve the purity of their love, the man (who was suspected to be mentally insane) convinced his girlfriend to commit suicide as a way to show their religious devotion in not wanting to sully the woman's purity. The picture was sent to their families, and when the news broke it was widely reprinted in black and white in the local newspapers. González claimed that she was attracted to this picture due to its "bad quality" or more so its plain quality, the simplification of the facial features that were almost deformed by the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This painting was the first of a number of paintings done by González in the 1960s in which she explored the intense violence in Colombia. During this time she produced a series of ink drawings on the same theme, that were tabloid photos of crimes of passion and political murders as well as advertisements for everything from bodybuilding to headache cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/arts/art-review-a-wry-defiance-behind-garish-colors-and-tabloid-dramas.html|title=ART REVIEW; A Wry Defiance Behind Garish Colors and Tabloid Dramas|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=1998-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== La última mesa (The Last Table) ===
This work was one of González's first furniture pieces out of her series of furniture works. It consisted of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]] work that had been repainted onto metal sheets that were them mounted on a faux-wood dining table. González intentionally chose this particular work by da Vinci because of its popularity in Colombian culture, this image was commonly placed above the main entrance door as a good-luck charm against thieves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work along with many of the others out of her furniture works had the intention of being a "representation of representations"  not only through an effort to make universal art, but also to subvert the original function of the furniture itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inverted Utopias|last=Ramírez|first=Mari Carmen|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=|location=Houston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, she intentionally takes all of the shadows and duller colors that made this work more European, and animated it more in hopes of making it more uniquely Latin American.

=== Nací en Florencia (I was born in Florence) ===
The full title of this work is ''Nací en Florencia y tenía 26 años cuando fue pintado mi retrato (esta frase pronunciada en una voz dulce y baja)'', translated to ''I was born in Florence and was 26 years old when my portrait was painted (this phrase pronounced in a low, sweet voice).'' In this work, González placed her own painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' where the mirror would be on a very large and elaborate antique coat rack. She used the location of the would be mirror to frame her work so when the viewers look at the work they see an image of beauty recreated in a cheap, reproduced style. The long title of the work is in an additional effort to reveal its humorous and a potentially slightly erotic intent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Canción de cuna (Lullaby)'' ===
This work consisted of an image of a mother holding her child that was based on a picture that was widely printed and distributed by a printing company in Colombia. The painting was painted on a sheet of metal that was then mounted on the inside of a crib that González found in the streets of Bogóta that originally belonged to a hospital. The theme of mother and child was one that commonly occurred in her artwork thus turning González herself into an image of maternity and hints at her observations about woman in the social structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/125437?artist_id=36415&amp;locale=en&amp;sov_referrer=artist|title=Beatriz González.

==History==
Brescia was founded in 1919 as '''Ursuline College''' by the [[Ursulines]], an organization of women of Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="Fay2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence J. Fay|title=History of Canadian Catholics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwNvfUGvRqsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=9 May 2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6988-1|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teresa Berger|title=Dissident Daughters: Feminist Liturgies in Global Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u37ZRKrTj3kC&amp;pg=PA106|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22379-3|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally located in an old converted house at 556 Wellington Street in downtown [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="LutmanGallery1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John H.

''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduates received University of Western Ontario degrees.&lt;ref name="BoutilierPrentice2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beverly Boutilier|author2=Alison Prentice|title=Creating Historical Memory: English-Canadian Women and the Work of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryT0gX7czfUC&amp;pg=PA307|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4164-1|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursuline Sisters named the [[Roman Catholic]] college after the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Brescia]] where their [[religious institute]] was founded. The first class was of seven young women who each paid $50 for tuition.

The Ursuline Superior General, Mother Clare Gaukler, bought a piece of land at 1285 Western Road in London, and construction began on a permanent building in 1923.  The building was built by contractor Joseph Michael Piggot, opened for classes and residence in 1925, and was named Brescia Hall.  Brescia Hall was later renamed "Ursuline Hall".

Brescia was known as a liberal arts school and the courses taught were: English, French, Spanish, Philosophy, History, Classics, and Religious Knowledge. Brescia students took other courses such as Science, Mathematics, Political Economy at [[University of Western Ontario|Western]]. Over time, Brescia adapted some of the courses (e.g., Philosophy) to be appropriate for Catholic women. In 1936, a Home Economics program was begun, it evolved into what is known today as the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences.

Ursuline College was renamed "Brescia College" in 1963, and in 2001 renamed "Brescia University College".

In September 2007, Brescia started the first graduate program.  In 2017, the college began offering a degree in non-profit management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/new-degree-breaks-ground-for-non-profit-sector/article25402352/ "New degree breaks ground for non-profit sector"].

==Student life==
The Preliminary Year programme and the Masters of Science are co-education; all undergraduate programs are women-only. However, all courses are accessible to UWO students, male or female, including students from Western's two other affiliated university colleges.

==Buildings==
James Carlisle Pennington designed Brescia Hall (1924–25) for the Ursuline Sisters, near Western Road at Sarnia Road, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1385 James Carlisle Pennington&lt;/ref&gt; The Mother St. James memorial building (completed in 1963) is the main building on campus; it houses classrooms, offices, student services, the business office, the Beryl Ivey Library and computer lab, the Mother St. James Memorial Auditorium, a coffee shop and the Circle Women's Centre resource centre. The Ursuline hall is the residence for 170 female students.  Ursuline Hall also has the cafeteria (Castle Café), some professors' offices, the food laboratories and a few classrooms. In September 2013, Brescia opened its new residence building and dining pavilion, Clare Hall, which houses just over 300 students and includes an eatery called the Mercato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928112843/http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Academy of Classical Design ~ Cast Hall.jpg|thumb|300px|Academy of Classical Design, Cast Studio - Southern Pines, NC.]]
'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21520">In the [[United States]], a '''conservation easement''' (also called '''conservation covenant''', '''conservation restriction''' or '''conservation servitude''') is a power invested in a qualified [[private land]] conservation organization (often called a "[[land trust]]") or government (municipal, county, state or federal) to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a [[landowner]] so as to achieve certain conservation purposes. It is an interest in [[real property]] established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government. The conservation easement "runs with the land", meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land. As with other real property interests, the grant of conservation easement is recorded in the local land records; the grant becomes a part of the [[chain of title]] for the property.

The conservation easement's purposes will vary depending on the character of the particular property, the goals of the land trust or government unit, and the needs of the landowners. For example, an easement’s purposes (often called "conservation objectives") might include any one or more of the following:
* Maintain and improve [[water quality]];
* Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy [[forest]];
* Maintain and improve [[wildlife]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and migration corridors;
* Protect scenic vistas visible from roads and other public areas; or
* Ensure that lands are managed so that they are always available for [[sustainable agriculture]] and forestry.

The conservation easement's administrative terms for advancing the conservation objectives also vary but typically forbid or substantially constrain subdivision and other [[real estate development]].

The most distinguishing feature of the conservation easement as a conservation tool is that it enables users to achieve specific conservation objectives on the land while keeping the land in the ownership and control of landowners for uses consistent with the conservation objectives.

The decision to place a conservation easement on a property is strictly a voluntary one whether the easement is sold or donated. The restrictions of the easement, once set in place, are perpetual (and potentially reduce the resale value of the associated property). Appraisals of the value of the easement, and financial arrangements between the parties (land owner and land trust), generally are kept private.

The landowner who grants a conservation easement continues to privately own and manage the land and may receive significant state and federal [[tax]] advantages for having donated and/or sold the conservation easement. In accepting the conservation easement, the easement holder has a responsibility to monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance with the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation occurs.

Although a conservation easement prohibits certain uses by the landowner, such an easement does not make the land public. On the contrary, many conservation easements confer no use of the land either to the easement holder or to the public. Furthermore, many conservation easements reserve to the landowner specific uses which if not reserved would be prohibited. Some conservation easements confer specific uses to the easement holder or to the public. These details are spelled out in the legal document that creates the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcr.org/index.php Equestrian Land Conservation Resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615132220/http://www.elcr.org/index.php |date=2008-06-15 }} ''Guide to equestrian-friendly conservation easements'', revised edition, 175 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref is complete;  no date etc. in the original --&gt;

==Income tax deductions==
Landowners in the United States who donate a "qualifying" conservation easement to a "qualified" land protection organization under the regulations set forth in 170(h) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] may be eligible for a federal income [[tax deduction]] equal to the value of their donation. The value of the easement donation, as determined by a qualified [[appraiser]], equals the difference between the [[fair market value]] of the property before and after the easement takes effect.

To qualify for this income tax deduction, the easement must be: a) perpetual; b) held by a qualified governmental or non-profit organization; and, c) serve a valid "conservation purpose", meaning the property must have an appreciable natural, scenic, historic, scientific, recreational, or open space value. As a result of legislation signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 17, 2006 (H.R. 4 The Pensions Protection Act of 2006), in 2006 and 2007, conservation easement donors were able to deduct the value of their gift at the rate of 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) per year. Further, landowners with 50% or more of their income from agriculture were able to deduct the donation at a rate of 100% of their AGI. Any amount of the donation remaining after the first year could be carried forward for fifteen additional years (allowing a maximum of sixteen years within which the deduction may be utilized), or until the amount of the deduction has been used up, whichever comes first. With the passage of the Farm Bill in the summer of 2008 these expanded federal income tax incentives were extended such that they also apply to all conservation easements donated in 2008 and 2009 and then this provision was extended again to apply to donations in 2010 and 2011. The provision has since expired and currently for 2012, conservation easement donations may only be deducted at the rate of 30% of the donor's AGI and after the first year the donor has a five-year carryforward.

==Income tax credits (states)==
Land conservation advocates have long tried to enact additional tax incentives for landowners to donate easements, above the federal charitable deduction (and state tax deduction in states that conform to federal tax process). There has been discussion of creating a federal income tax credit for easement donors since around 1980. However, no federal tax credit has been enacted. States, however, have moved ahead to grant credits that can be used to pay state income tax to donors of qualified conservation easements. In 1983, North Carolina became the first state to establish such a program.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina G.S.§105-151.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Philip Tabas of [[The Nature Conservancy]] promoted the state tax credit idea widely in the 1990s. In 1999, four state legislatures enacted state tax credit programs (Virginia, Delaware, Colorado, and Connecticut, in that order). South Carolina and California followed in 2000. Several other states have followed since.

For landowners with little income subject to state taxation, a tax credit is a hollow reward for reducing the value of real property by donating a conservation easement. To respond to this, Colorado conservationists made their state tax credit transferable in 2000—that is, the donor/landowner can sell her/his credit to other parties; the buyers then use the purchased tax credit to pay their Colorado income tax. This is appealing to buyers because the credit is sold at a discount from face value. Virginia followed by enacting transferability in 2002. Delegate Bill Howell (now Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates) introduced HB1322, which had been suggested to him by conservationists Charles Davenport and Phil Hocker. HB1322 was enacted, effective retroactively to January 1, 2002. Other states have followed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Walden to Wall Street, Chapter 8|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC, USA|isbn=1-59726-029-0|pages=124–137|authorlink=Transferable State Tax Credits as a Conservation Incentive|editor=James N. Levitt|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "caps" on the amount of credit an easement can generate, and other restrictions, limit the scope of the different state tax credit programs in varying manners.

In the states where credit for conservation land donations is transferable, free markets have arisen. Brokers assist landowners with excess credit to contact buyers, and the brokers often handle payments and paperwork to protect the principals, and to ensure that transfers are fully reported to the state tax authorities. The federal and state tax treatment of profits from sale and use of transferable tax credit have been the subject of extensive discussion and the issuance of several guidance documents by the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[A comprehensive treatment of IRS views on state income tax credit transfers is contained within IRS AM 2007-002, issued 26Jan2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Mexico state income tax credit was originated in 2003.[SB 581] New transferability legislation, effective January 1, 2008, applies retroactively to conservation easements effected from January 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/NMAC/parts/title03/03.013.0020.htm 3.13.20 NMAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia transferable credit program is the largest among the States in dollar value of property conserved. By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[For a comprehensive online treatment of the Virginia credit program, see: {{cite web |url=http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194232/http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifying easements cover over {{convert|516,000|acre|km2}} of Virginia landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[Virginia Department of Taxation, public presentations, Jan2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The credit allowance is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant in the area and the conservation values that they cause to be protected. The concept of state tax credit action (in the absence of a federal tax credit) that Philip Tabas and The Nature Conservancy promoted in the 1990s has borne remarkable fruit, and continues to expand today.

==Estate tax reductions and exclusions==
For landowners who will leave sizable estates upon their death, the most important financial impact of a conservation easement may be a significant reduction in [[estate tax]]es. Estate taxes often make it difficult for heirs to keep land intact and in the family because of high estate tax rates and high development value of land. It may be necessary to subdivide or sell land for development in order to pay these taxes which may not be the desire of the landowner or their heirs. A conservation easement can often provide significant help with this problem in three important ways:

# ''Reduction in value of the estate.'' The deceased's estate will be reduced by the value of the donated conservation easement. As a result, taxes will be lower because heirs will not be required to pay taxes on the extinguished development rights. In other words, heirs will only have to pay estate taxes on preserved farmland values, and not full development values.
#''Estate exclusion.'' Section 2031(c) of the tax code provides further estate tax incentives for properties subject to a donated conservation easement. When property has a qualified conservation easement placed upon it, up to an additional 40% of the value of land (subject to a $500,000 cap) may be excluded from the estate when the landowner dies. This exclusion is in addition to the reduction in land value attributable to the easement itself as described above.
#''After death easement.'' Heirs may also receive these benefits (but not the income tax deduction) by electing to donate a conservation easement after the landowner's death and prior to filing the estate return (called a "post mortem" election).

In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Esq., Patricia. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and property tax incentives==
Some states ([[Colorado]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[North Carolina]]) offer a state income tax incentive and many states offer [[property tax]] incentives to conservation easement donors. In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Patricia, Esq. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues to consider==
* As is the case with any property interest, a conservation easement may be taken by eminent domain (and thereby extinguished) when the public value of the proposed project exceeds that of the conservation interest being protected by the easement.
* Conservation easements may result in a significant reduction in the sale price of the land because a builder can no longer develop it. In fact, this difference in value is the basis for the granting of the original tax incentives. An estimate of 35%–65% value reduction has been made on conservation easement land to the land owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clear boundaries of adjacent properties are not always consistent with each other. Currently, the NCED manages this issue by snapping boundary polygons to a standard parcel layer which may differ from the original data provided by a landowner.

==Purchase of conservation easements==
Many conservation easements are purchased with funds from federal, state, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, or private donors. In these cases, landowners are paid directly for the purchase of the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farm Bill]], updated every 5 or more years, provides an important source of funds for conservation easement purchase. The 2014 Farm Bill created the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) by consolidating the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, the Grassland Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. Under ACEP, the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] helps tribes, state and local governments, and land trusts protect agriculture from development and other non-agricultural uses. ACEP includes Agricultural Land Easements and Wetland Reserve Easements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural land easements preserve land for food production and aids in soil and water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agricultural Conservation Easement Purchase Program|url=https://conservationtools.org/guides/47-agricultural-conservation-easement-purchase-program|website=Conservation Tools|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland reserve easements aim to restore wetland areas that have been converted into agricultural land. To maximize the benefits, the program targets land that has both a high chance of restoration success and a history of low crop yields or crop failure. The Farm Bill also funds the purchase of conservation easements for forestland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Forest Legacy Program]] is a voluntary Federal program in partnership with States which protects privately owned forest lands. Landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Land|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land|website=US Forest Service|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of states have direct funding sources for conservation. Commonly used funding sources include real estate transfer tax, legislative bonds, and lottery proceeds. For instance, in 2014, New Jersey added conservation funding from corporate business taxes through constitutional amendment, approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states and counties have programs for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements (PACE) to protect productive farmland from non-agricultural development. In 1974, [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] in New York enacted the first PACE (also known as purchase of development rights or PDR) program. King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2003, the PACE program operates in 23 states, including 19 statewide and more than 45 local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308205032/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2016, the PACE program operates in 32 states through both state and local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">'''Cost engineering''' is "the [[engineering]] practice devoted to the [[Project management|management of project]] cost, involving such activities as estimating, cost control, cost forecasting, investment appraisal and risk analysis."&lt;ref&gt;"Provoc - Glossary of Common Project Control Terms," The Association of Cost Engineers (ACostE), http://www.acoste.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; "Cost Engineers budget, plan and monitor investment projects. They seek the optimum balance between cost, quality and time requirements."&lt;ref&gt;"Home - DACE," Dutch Association of Cost Engineers, http://www.dace.nl/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skills and knowledge of cost engineers are similar to those of quantity surveyors.  In many industries, cost engineering is synonymous with project controls.  As the title "engineer" has [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|legal requirements in many jurisdictions]] (i.e. Texas, Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacei.org/aboutus/news/2013/2013-06-19.shtml|title=AACE International - About Us - News Archive - 2013 - Page Title|website=www.aacei.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the cost engineering discipline is often renamed to project controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectcontrolsonline.com/Home/DefinitionandImportanceofProjectControls.aspx|title=Definition and Importance of Project Controls|website=www.projectcontrolsonline.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A cost engineer is "an engineer whose judgment and experience are utilized in the application of scientific principles and techniques to problems of estimation; cost control; business planning and management science; profitability analysis; project management; and planning and scheduling."&lt;ref&gt;''AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90, COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY, TCM Framework: General Reference'', AACE, 2010, pg 24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
One key objective of cost engineering is to arrive at accurate cost estimates and schedules and to avoid [[cost overrun]]s and schedule slips. Cost engineering goes beyond preparing cost estimates and schedules by helping manage resources and supporting assessment and decision making. "The discipline of ‘cost engineering’ can be considered to encompass a wide range of cost-related aspects of engineering and programme management, but in particular cost estimating,cost analysis/cost assessment, [[design-to-cost]], schedule analysis/planning and risk assessment."&lt;ref&gt;David Greves &amp; Herve Joumier, "Cost Engineering for Cost-Effective Space Programmes," esa bulletin 115 - august 2003, pg1&lt;/ref&gt; The broad array of cost engineering topics represent the intersection of the fields of project management, business management, and engineering. Most people have a limited view of what [[engineering]] encompasses. The most obvious perception is that engineering addresses technical issues such as the physical design of a structure or system. However, beyond the physical manifestation of a design of a structure or system (for example, a building), there are other dimensions to consider such as the money, time, and other resources that were invested in the creation of the building. Cost engineers refer to these investments collectively as "costs". 

Cost engineering, then, can be considered an adjunct of traditional engineering. It recognizes and focuses on the relationships between the physical and cost dimensions of whatever is being "engineered". Cost engineering is most often taught at universities as part of [[construction engineering]], [[engineering management]], [[civil engineering]],  and related curricula because it is most often practiced on engineering and construction capital projects. [[Engineering economics]] is a core skill and knowledge area of cost engineering.

Associations, considered non-profits organizations--one example, is [[AACE International]] "is dedicated to the tenets of furthering the concepts of Total Cost Management and Cost Engineering. Total Cost Management is the effective application of professional and technical expertise to plan and control resources, costs, profitability and risk. Simply stated, it is a systematic approach to managing cost throughout the life cycle of any enterprise, program, facility, project, product or service. This is accomplished through the application of cost engineering and cost management principles, proven methodologies and the latest technology in support of the management process. ... Total Cost Management is that area of engineering practice where engineering judgment and experience are utilized in the application of scientific principles and techniques to problems of business and program planning; cost estimating; economic and financial analysis; cost engineering; program and project management; planning and scheduling; and cost and schedule performance measurement and change control. In summary, the list of practice areas ... are collectively called cost engineering; while the “process” through which these practices are applied is called total cost management or TCM.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Hollmann, PE CCE, ''AACE International Recommended Practice No. 11R-88, REQUIRED SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF COST ENGINEERING, TCM Framework: General Reference'', AACE, 2010, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cost engineering is a field of engineering practice that began in the 1950s (AACE International was founded in 1956). The skills and knowledge areas of cost engineers are similar to those of [[Quantity surveyor|quantity surveyors]]. AACE International is one of many international engineering organizations representing practitioners in these fields. The International Cost Engineering Congress (ICEC) was founded in 1976 as a Worldwide Confederation of Cost Engineering, Quantity Surveying and Project Management Societies.

In 2006, AACE published the [[Total Cost Management]] (TCM) Framework which outlines an integrated process for applying the skills and knowledge of cost engineering (see References). This has also been called the world's first process for portfolio, program and project management.

==Professional titles or positions in cost engineering==
"Cost engineering practitioners tend to be: a) specialized in function (e.g., cost estimating, planning and scheduling, etc.); b) focused on either the asset management or project control side of the TCM process; and c) focused on a particular industry (e.g., engineering and construction, manufacturing, information technology, etc) or asset type (e.g., chemical process, buildings, software, etc.)... They may work for the business that owns and operates the asset (emphasis on economics and analysis), or they may work for the contractor that executes the projects (emphasis on planning and control)."&lt;ref&gt;John K. Hollmann, PE CCE, ''AACE International Recommended Practice No. 11R-88, REQUIRED SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF COST ENGINEERING, TCM Framework: General Reference'', AACE, 2010, pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecomechatronics''' is an engineering approach to developing and applying mechatronical technology in order to reduce the ecological impact and [[total cost of ownership]] of machines. It builds upon the integrative approach of [[mechatronics]], but not with the aim of only improving the functionality of a machine. Mechatronics is the multidisciplinary field of science and engineering that merges mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science to improve and optimize product design and manufacturing. In ecomechatronics, additionally, functionality should go hand in hand with an efficient use and limited impact on resources. Machine improvements are targeted in 3 key areas: [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], performance and user comfort ([[noise]] &amp; [[vibration]]s).
[[File:Machine as a system.png|thumb|right|Machine as a system requiring energy and consumables to transform an input into an output, thereby generating emissions (heat, noise, ...)]]
[[File:Mechatronical system.png|thumb|right|Schematic of a mechatronical system consisting of a controller, amplifier, drive, mechanical structure and sensors]]

== Description ==

Among policy makers and manufacturing industries there is a growing awareness of the scarcity of resources and the need for [[sustainable development]]. This results in new regulations with respect to the design of machines (e.g. [[European Ecodesign Directive]] 2009/125/EC) and to a paradigm shift in the global machines market: "instead of maximum profit from minimum capital, maximum added value must be generated from minimal resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resource efficient production|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/research-topics/production-and-environment/production-saves-energy_2.html|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing industries increasingly require high performance machines that use resources (energy, consumables) economically in a human-centered production. Machine building companies and [[original equipment manufacturer]]s are thus urged to respond to this market demand with a new generation of high performance machines with higher energy efficiency and user comfort.
[[File:Evolution of crude oil price.png|thumb|right|Evolution of crude oil price. Data source: Statistical Review of World Energy 2013, BP]]

A reduction of the energy consumption lowers energy costs and reduces environmental impact. Typically more than 80% of the total-life-cycle impact of a machine is attributed to its energy consumption during the use phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amended Ecodesign Working Plan - Task 1 &amp; 2 Main report|date=2011-02-18|publisher=European Commission|location=Brussels|url=http://www.ecodesign-wp2.eu/downloads/2011-02-18_Task1-2_Main-report.pdf|editor=VHK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, improving a machine's energy efficiency is the most effective way of reducing its environmental impact. 
Performance quantifies how well a machine executes its function and is typically related to productivity, precision and availability. User comfort is related to the exposure of operators and the environment to noise &amp; vibrations due to machine operation.

Since energy efficiency, performance and noise &amp; vibrations are coupled in a machine they need to be addressed in an integrated way in the design phase. Example of the interrelation between the 3 key areas: with increasing machine speed typically the machine’s productivity increases, but energy consumption will increase as well and machine vibrations may grow such that machine accuracy (e.g. positioning accuracy) and availability (due to downtime and maintenance) decrease. Ecomechatronical design deals with the trade-off between these key areas.

== Approach ==

Ecomechatronics impacts the way mechatronical systems and machines are being designed and implemented. Therefore, the transformation to a new generation of machines concerns knowledge institutes, [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, CAE software suppliers, machine builders and industrial machine owners. The fact that about 80% of the environmental impact of a machine is determined by its design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-design of Energy-Related Products|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/eco_design_en.htm|publisher=European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; puts emphasis on making the right technological design choices. A model-based, multidisciplinary design approach is required in order to address the energy efficiency, performance and user comfort of a machine in an integrated way.

The key enabling technologies can be categorized in machine components, machine design methods &amp; tools, and machine control. A few examples are listed below per category.

'''Machine components'''
* Energy efficient electrical motors: cf. energy efficiency classes of electric motors, [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/harmonised-standards/ecodesign/electric_motors_en.htm ecodesign requirements for electric motors]
* [[Variable frequency drive]]s: variable motor speed enables energy reduction with respect to fixed speed applications
* Variable hydraulic pumps: energy reduction by adapting to required pressure and flow (e.g. variable displacement pump, load sensing pump)
* Energy storage technologies: electrical (battery, capacitor, [[supercapacitor]]), hydraulical (accumulator), kinetic energy ([[flywheel]]), pneumatic, magnetic ([[superconducting magnetic energy storage]])

'''Design methods &amp; tools'''
* Energetic simulations: using energetic machine models and empirical data (e.g. energy efficiency maps) to estimate the machine's energy consumption in the design phase
* Energy demand optimization: e.g. load leveling in order to avoid peaks in power demand
* Hybridization: applying at least one other, intermediate energy form in order to reduce primary power source consumption e.g. in vehicles with internal combustion engines (see [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain]])
* Vibro-acoustic analysis: study of the noise &amp; vibrations signature of a machine in order to localize and differentiate between their root causes
* Multibody modeling: simulation of the interaction forces and displacements of coupled rigid bodies, e.g. to assess the effect of vibration dampers on a mechanical structure
* Active vibration damping: e.g. use of piezoelectric bearings for active control of machine vibrations
* [[Rapid control prototyping]]: provides a fast and inexpensive way for control and signal processing engineers to verify designs early and evaluate design tradeoffs

'''Machine control'''
* Energy consumption minimization: control signals are optimized for minimum energy consumption
* Energy management of energy storage systems: controlling the power flows and state-of-charge of an energy storage system with the aim of achieving maximum energy benefit and maximum system lifespan
* Model-based control: taking advantage of system models to improve the outcome (accuracy, reaction time, ...) of the controlled system
* (Self-)learning control: control self-adapting to the system and its changing environment, reducing the need for control parameter tuning and adaptation by the control engineer
* Optimal machine control: the control of the system is regarded as an optimization problem to which the control rules are considered the optimal solution (see [[Optimal control]])

== Applications ==

Some examples of ecomechatronical system applications are:
* [[Komatsu PC200-8 Hybrid]]: the world's first hybrid excavator has an energy storage system based on [[supercapacitor]]s. The energy recuperation in the hydraulic drive line during braking results in a significant improvement of fuel economy.
* Hybrid bus: different hybrid bus types have been commercialized (e.g. ExquiCity bus by [[Van Hool]]), using [[fuel cell]]s or a diesel engine as a primary energy source and batteries and/or [[supercapacitor]]s as energy storage systems.
* Hybrid tram vehicle: hybridization in tram vehicles enables energy recuperation as well as mobility without overhead lines, as applied in e.g. some of the [[Combino Supra]] tram vehicles by Siemens Transportation Systems. The system uses a combination of traction batteries and [[supercapacitor]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20872">{{Critical pedagogy}}
The '''ecopedagogy''' movement is an outgrowth of the theory and practice of [[critical pedagogy]], a body of educational praxis influenced by the philosopher and educator [[Paulo Freire]]. Ecopedagogy's mission is to develop a robust appreciation for the collective potentials of humanity and to foster social justice throughout the world. It does so as part of a future-oriented, ecological and political vision that radically opposes the globalization of ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] and [[imperialism]], while also attempting to foment forms of critical [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of ecopedagogy's goals is the realization of culturally relevant forms of knowledge grounded in normative concepts such as [[sustainability]], planetarity (i.e. identifying as an earthling) and biophilia (i.e. love of all life).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early history==
The ecopedagogy movement began in a Latin American educational context, growing out of discussions at the second [[Earth Summit]], held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators desired to present a theory and discourse about the interrelationship between society and the environment, a statement would eventually be ratified as the [[Earth Charter]] in 2000. &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2000. ''Pedagogia da Terra''. São Paulo, Brazil: Peiropolis.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the First International Symposium on the Earth Charter in the Perspective of Education was held by the [http://www.paulofreire.org/ Instituto Paulo Freire, Brasil] directed by Moacir Gadotti and in collaboration with the Earth Council and [[UNESCO]]. This was soon followed by the First International Forum on Ecopedagogy. As a result of these conferences, the Ecopedagogy Charter was also formed, launching the spread of ecopedagogy seminars and programs around the world. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Objectives and aims==

Ecopedagogy's primary goal is to create a "planetary consciousness" through revolutionary teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2004|title=Revitalizing the Commons or an Individualized Approach to Planetary Citizenship: The Choice Before Us|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=36:1|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement aims to create educational programs that interrogate the intersection of social, political, economic and environmental systems. As an outgrowth of critical pedagogy, ecopedagogy critiques [[environmental education]] and [[education for sustainable development]] as vain attempts by mainstream forms of pedagogy seeking to appear relevant regarding current issues of environmental degradation. &lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Richard. (2008). ''From Education for Sustainable Development to Ecopedagogy: Sustaining Capitalism or Sustaining Life?'' Green Theory &amp; Praxis: The Journal of Ecopedagogy. 4:1&lt;/ref&gt; It is critical of mainstream representations of nature that are potentially informed by racist, sexist, and classist values, &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and wary of the tendency of "[[greenwashing]]" of environmental terminology. &lt;ref&gt;Bowers, C.A. 2010. Educational Reforms that Foster Ecological Intelligence. ''Education and the Environment'' Vol. 37, No. 4, pp. 9–31&lt;/ref&gt; 

While members of the ecopedagogy movement recognize that environmental education can accomplish some positive change, they question the ways in which environmental education (especially within global north) is often reduced to forms of experiential pedagogy and [[outdoor education]] without questioning the mainstream experience of nature as pristine wilderness. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ecopedagogy points out that environmental education is often tethered to state and corporate-sponsored science and social studies standards or fails to articulate the political necessity for widespread understanding of the unsustainable nature of modern lifestyles'''.''' However, ecopedagogy has tried to utilize the ongoing United Nations Decade of Educational for Sustainable Development (2005–2015) to make strategic interventions on behalf of the oppressed, using it as an opportunity to unpack and clarify the concept of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development.]]

Ecopedagogy scholar Richard Kahn describes the three main goals of the ecopedagogy movement to be:

# Creating opportunities for the proliferation of ecoliteracy programs, both within schools and society.
# Bridging the gap of praxis between scholars and the public (especially activists) on ecopedagogical interests.
# Instigating dialogue and self-reflective solidarity across the many groups among educational left, particularly in light of the existing planetary crisis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Angela Antunes and Moacir Gadotti (2005) write:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecopedagogy is not just another pedagogy among many other pedagogies. It not only has meaning as an alternative project concerned with nature preservation (Natural Ecology) and the impact made by human societies on the natural environment (Social Ecology), but also as a new model for sustainable civilization from the ecological point of view (Integral Ecology), which implies making changes on economic, social, and cultural structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Social movement theory|social movement theorists]] Ron Ayerman and Andrew Jamison, there are three broad dimensions of environmentally related movements: cosmological, technological, and organizational.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ecopedagogy, these dimensions are outlined by Richard Kahn (2010) as the following:

* The cosmological dimension focuses on how [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy]], i.e. understanding the natural systems that sustain life, can transform people’s worldviews. For example, assumptions about society’s having the right to exploit nature can be transformed into understanding of the need for ecological balance to support society in the long term. The success of such ‘cosmological’ thinking transformations can be assessed by the degree to which such paradigm shifts are adopted by the public.
* The technological dimension is two-fold: critiquing the set of polluting technologies that have contributed to traditional development as well as some which are used or misused under the pretext of sustainable development; and promoting clean technologies that do not interfere with ecological and social balance.
* The organizational dimension emphasizes that knowledge should be of and for the people, thus academics should be in dialogue with public discourse and social movements. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Discussion of term in literature==

Ecopedagogy is not the collection of theories or practices developed by any particular set of individuals. Rather, akin to the [[World Social Forum]] and other related forms of contemporary popular education strategies, it is a worldwide association of critical educators, theorists, non-governmental and governmental organizations, grassroots activists and concerned citizens who engage in ongoing dialogue and political action. This process attempts to develop ecopedagogical praxis in relation to the needs of particular places, groups and time periods.

The earliest use of the term "ecopedagogy" may have been by de Haan (1984) in a now little known German text &lt;ref&gt;de Haan, G. 1984. Die Schwierigkeiten der Padagogik. In Beer &amp; de Haan (Eds.), ''Okopadagogik. Aufstehen gegen den Untergang der Natur''. Weinheim, Basel: Beltz: pp.&amp;nbsp;77–91.&lt;/ref&gt;. Shortly thereafter, in the first known English use of the term, Gronemeyer (1987) described ecopedagogy as the merging of environmentalist politics and adult education. &lt;ref&gt;Gronemeyer, M. 1987. Ecological Education a Failing Practice? Or: Is the Ecological Movement an Educational Movement? In W. Lierman &amp; J. Kulich (Eds.), Adult Education and the Challenge of the 1990s. London: Croom Helm.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy has also been discussed by Ahlberg (1998) &lt;ref&gt;Ahlberg, M. 1998. Ecopedagogy and Ecodidactics: Education for Sustainable Development, Good Environment and Good Life. ''Bulletins of the Faculty of Education''. No: 69.University of Joensuu.&lt;/ref&gt; ; Jardine (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Jardine, D. W. 2000. ''“Under the Tough Old Stars”: Ecopedagogical Essays''. Brandon, Vermont: Solomon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;; Petrina (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrina|first1=S|year=2000|title=The Political Ecology of Design and Technology Education: An Inquiry into Methods|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology and Design Education|volume=10|issue=3|pages=207–237|doi=10.1023/a:1008955016067}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Yang &amp; Hung (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=S. K.|last2=Hung|first2=R.|year=2004|title=Towards Construction of an Ecopedagogy Based on the Philosophy of Ecocentrism|url=|journal=Journal of Taiwan Normal University|volume=49|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and Payne (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=P|year=2005|title=Growing Up Green|url=|journal=Journal of the HEIA|volume=12|issue=3|pages=2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The work of Lummis (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lummis|first1=G|year=2002|title=Globalisation: Building a Partnership Ethic for an Ecopedagogy in Western Australia|url=|journal=The Australian Journal of Teacher Education|volume=27|issue=1|doi=10.14221/ajte.2002v27n1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shares some sympathies, such as a critical theory approach.

Ironically, at the same time it was coined by Freire's friend-cum-critic [[Ivan Illich]] (1988) to describe an educational process in which educators and educands become inscribed in abstract pedagogical systems, resulting in pedagogy as an end and not a means.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. 1988. Ecopedagogia. ''Alternativas II''. Mexico: Joaquín Mortiz / Planeta.&lt;/ref&gt; As used by Illich, ecopedagogy is represented by forms of education that seek the total administration of life through mandatory pedagogical experiences of systemization. As such, he believed that the movements for lifelong education and the creation of global classrooms (Illich &amp; Verne, 1981) by bureaucratic educational institutions exemplified such approaches. However, he was also critical of popular environmentalist pedagogy attempting to mobilize people's sentiments for solutions to problems such as global warming, hunger, and rainforest destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. &amp; E. Verne. 1981. ''Imprisoned in the Global Classroom''. London: Writers &amp; Readers.&lt;/ref&gt; Illich's point was that such an ecopedagogy works on a problems/solutions axis that implies a global [[managerialism]] that is abhorrent to truly sustainable living in the world. This is a different idea from the way the term and concept is being defined and utilized in critical education circles today, though it is potentially of great importance for the future development of the ecopedagogy movement on the whole.

[[Paulo Freire]] was himself at work on a book of ecopedagogy upon his death in 1997, parts of which are included in his posthumous ''Pedagogy of Indignation'' (2004). &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2004. ''Pedagogy of Indignation''. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential books include: Francisco Gutierrez and Cruz Prado's ''Ecopedagogy and Planetary Citizenship'' (1999), &lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, F. &amp; C. Prado. 1999. ''Ecopedagogia e Cidadania Planetaria''. São Paulo, Brazil: Cortez.&lt;/ref&gt; Moacir Gadotti's ''Pedagogy of the Earth'' (2000), &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gadotti, M. 2003. Pedagogy of the Earth and the Culture of Sustainability. Paper presented at Lifelong Learning, Participatory Democracy and Social Change: Local and Global Perspectives conference, Toronto, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Kahn's ''Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement''. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Ecopedagogy: An Introduction. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 1–33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Criticisms ==
Both supporters and critics of ecopedagogy agree that historically, critical educators in the West have been largely unsuccessful at addressing environmental issues in their classrooms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaren and Houston|first=|date=2005|title=Revolutionary Ecologies: Ecosocialism and Critical Pedagogy|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much disagreement still exists between critics and supporters of ecopedagogy on the ethics, theoretical approach, and methodology of this pedagogical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houston, D and McLaren, P.|first=|date=2005|title=The Nature of Political Amnesia: A Response to C.A. 'Chet' Bowers|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=196-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic, C.A. Bowers, argues that if ecopedagogy (and the larger critical pedagogy of Freire and Gadotti) were universally adopted, it would contribute to the hegemonic spread of Western culture and systems, thereby choking out non-Western ways of thinking, viewing, and interacting with the human and built environments. Bowers further argues that adoption of Freirean ecopedagogy would hasten the existence of a world monoculture and would fail to address the systemic roots of the current ecological crisis and fail to protect the commons from further exploitation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2005|title=How Peter McLaren and Donna Houston, and Other "Green" Marxists Contribute to the Globalization of the West's Industrial Culture|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=185–195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, ecopedagogy is akin to an educational Trojan horse that is little more than a vehicle for transmitting Western culture and domination. 

Moderate critics of ecopedagogy argue that the critical lens of ecopedagogy can be useful, but that its adherents must be actively critical of ecopedagogy itself. They argue that without a constant focus on understanding and fostering diversity in thought, culture, and ecosystem, ecopedagogy is meaningless and could be counter-productive to its aims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruenewald|first=David A.|date=2005|title=More than one profound truth: Making sense of divergent criticalities|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=206-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy (and critical pedagogy) has also been heavily criticized for not being critical of the categories that underlie its work. Here, critics argue that in valuing individualism, ecopedagogy fails to attend to traditional eco-centered cultures' already deep connection to the non-human world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2012|title=Questioning the idea of the individual as an autonomous moral agent|url=|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=41:3|pages=301-310|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some scholars from the eco- and critical pedagogical traditions fail to recognize how the "primary categories in classical liberal thought may operate in the discourse of critical pedagogy".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martisewicz|first=Rebecca|date=2005|title=On Acknowledging Differences that Make a Difference: My Two Cents|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=215-224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecopedagogy in action ==
Ecopedagogy emphasizes the necessity of praxis alongside theory. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gaard, G. (2009). ''Children’s environmental literature: from ecocriticism to ecopedagogy.'' Neohelicon 36:321–334.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the specific ecopedagogy degree programs and Paulo Freire Institutes, there are many instances of ecological education that not only teach people the critical thinking of ecopedagogy but also engage them in learning through action. For example, a study conducted with 10-year-old children in West Scotland concluded that interactive dramatic education was successful in engaging students in ecological, social, and political dimensions of global problems such as solid waste and deforestation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McNaughton, M.J. (2010). ''Educational drama in education for sustainable development: ecopedagogy in action.'' Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society. 18:3, 289-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic exercises required to make a decision or take a stance, thus strengthening their understanding and conviction of the issues. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; And ecopedagogy is not limited to formal students; in Turkey, for example, participatory action research showed that an outdoor community-based ecopedagogy program for university professors was successful in the "promotion of public participation, the engagement of students, teacher and parents in local environmental issues, and the development of social capital to achieve environmental sustainability. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By situating local knowledge within critical pedagogy and social activism, these projects can help universities to bridge the gap between academia and society."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Mustafa, Y.U. et al. (2010). A Participatory Action Research Study of Nature Education in Nature: Towards Community-based Eco-pedagogy. International Journal of Progressive Education. 6:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greta Gaard outlines the necessity for children's environmental literature to encompass the following core aspects of ecopedagogy:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* praxis
* teaching ABOUT the social and natural environment
* teaching IN the social and natural environment
* teaching THROUGH the social and natural environment
* teaching the connections of sustainability
* urgency &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The question of technology had become increasingly pertinent. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Technological Transformation as Ecopedagogy: Reconstructing Technoliteracy. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 61–80&lt;/ref&gt; While the production and consumption of technology largely has a negative effect on the environment and certain aspects of society-environment relations, technology still provides certain new avenues in ecopedagogy. For example, more people have access to information and collaboration through the internet and thus can engage in informal ecological education faster and in wider spheres. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly, community projects to install solar panels or wind turbines or simple technology that help farms to transition to agroecology are examples of the uses of technology in ecopedagogy.

In [[classical drama]], the '''epitasis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπίτασις}}) is the main action of a play, in which the trials and tribulations of the main character increase and build toward a climax and dénouement. It is the third and central part when a play is analyzed into five separate parts: prelude, [[protasis]], epitasis, [[catastasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].

In modern [[dramatic theory]], the [[Dramatic structure|dramatic arc]] is often referred to, which uses somewhat different divisions but is substantially the same concept overall.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''''Esthesic''''' (UK ''aesthesic'') and '''''poietic''''' are terms used in [[semiotics]], the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], to describe perceptive and [[productive]] levels, processes, and analyses of [[symbol]]ic forms.

Like [[emic and etic|'emic' and 'etic']], both words appear to be derived from a suffix, ''-poietic'' (from {{lang-el|ποιητικός}} "creative") meaning productive or formative and ''-esthesic'' (from αἴσθησις "sense") being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the [[neutral level]]. The neutral level is the "trace" left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, "a symbolic form... is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process) that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.'"

{{Use mdy dates |date=September 2017}}
'''Evolvability''' is defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive [[evolution]]. Evolvability is the ability of a population of organisms to not merely generate [[genetic diversity]], but to generate ''[[adaptation |adaptive]]'' genetic diversity, and thereby evolve through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Colegrave N, Collins S |title=Experimental evolution: experimental evolution and evolvability |journal=Heredity |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=464–70 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18212804 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.15.8420 |vauthors=Kirschner M, Gerhart J |title=Evolvability |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=15 |pages=8420–8427 |year=1998 |pmid=9671692 |pmc=33871|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.8420K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altenberg 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/3-540-59046-3_11 |author=Altenberg, Lee |title=Genome growth and the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/yl347l100328g5g6/ |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=899 |pages=205–259 |year=1995|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-540-59046-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a biological organism to evolve by natural selection, there must be a certain minimum probability that new, heritable variants are beneficial. Random [[mutation]]s, unless they occur in [[Non-coding DNA|DNA sequences with no function]], are expected to be mostly detrimental. Beneficial mutations are always rare, but if they are too rare, then [[adaptation]] cannot occur. Early failed efforts to evolve computer programs by random mutation and selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedberg RM |title=A Learning Machine: Part I &amp;#124; |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–13 |year=1958 |doi=10.1147/rd.21.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that evolvability is not a given, but depends on the representation{{clarify|date=October 2018}} of the program{{clarify|date=September 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor= Kinnear, Kenneth |author=Altenberg, Lee |title=The evolution of evolvability in genetic programming |url=http://dynamics.org/Altenberg/PAPERS/EEGP/ |journal=Advances in Genetic Programming |pages=47–74 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, the evolvability of organisms depends on their [[Genetic architecture|genotype–phenotype]] map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2410639 |pmid=28565291 |vauthors=Wagner GP, Altenberg L |title=Complex adaptations and the evolution of evolvability |journal=Evolution |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=967–976 |year=1996 |jstor=2410639}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that [[genome]]s are structured in ways that make beneficial changes less unlikely. This has been taken as evidence that evolution has created not just fitter organisms, but populations of organisms that are better able to evolve.

== Alternative definitions ==

[[Andreas Wagner]]&lt;ref name="Wagner 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wagner A |title=Robustness and evolvability in living systems |publisher=Princeton University Press |series=Princeton Studies in Complexity |year=2005 | isbn=0-691-12240-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes two definitions of evolvability. According to the first definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if its properties show heritable genetic variation, and
* if natural selection can thus change these properties.

According to the second definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if it can acquire novel functions through genetic change, functions that help the organism survive and reproduce.

For example, consider an [[enzyme]] with multiple [[alleles]] in the population. Each allele catalyzes the same reaction, but with a different level of activity. However, even after millions of years of evolution, exploring many sequences with similar function, no mutation might exist that gives this enzyme the ability to catalyze a different reaction. Thus, although the enzyme's activity is evolvable in the first sense, that does not mean that the enzyme's function is evolvable in the second sense. However, every system evolvable in the second sense must also be evolvable in the first.

[[Massimo Pigliucci |Pigliucci]]&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pigliucci M |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci |title=Is evolvability evolvable? |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18059367 |doi=10.1038/nrg2278}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes three classes of definition, depending on timescale. The first corresponds to Wagner's first, and represents the very short timescales that are described by [[quantitative genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1732160 |pmc=1204793 |year=1992 |author1=Houle |first1=D |title=Comparing evolvability and variability of quantitative traits |journal=Genetics |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=195–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11692-011-9127-6 |title=Heritability is not Evolvability |journal=Evolutionary Biology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=258 |year=2011 |last1=Hansen |first1=Thomas F |last2=Pélabon |first2=Christophe |last3=Houle |first3=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He divides Wagner's second definition into two categories, one representing the intermediate timescales that can be studied using [[population genetics]], and one representing exceedingly rare long-term innovations of form.

[[Massimo Pigliucci |Pigliucci]]'s second definition of evolvability includes Altenberg's&lt;ref name="Altenberg 1994" /&gt; quantitative concept of evolvability, being not a single number, but the entire upper tail of the fitness distribution of the offspring produced by the population. This quantity was considered a "local" property of the instantaneous state of a population, and its integration over the population's evolutionary trajectory, and over many possible populations, would be necessary to give a more global measure of evolvability.

==Generating more variation==
More heritable phenotypic variation means more evolvability. While mutation is the ultimate source of heritable variation, its permutations and combinations also make a big difference. Sexual reproduction generates more variation (and thereby evolvability) relative to asexual reproduction (see [[evolution of sexual reproduction]]). Evolvability is further increased by generating more variation when an organism is stressed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ram |first=Yoav |author2=Hadany, Lilach |title=THE EVOLUTION OF STRESS-INDUCED HYPERMUTATION IN ASEXUAL POPULATIONS |journal=Evolution |year=2012 |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=2315–2328 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01576.x |pmid=22759304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus likely to be less well adapted, but less variation when an organism is doing well. The amount of variation generated can be adjusted in many different ways, for example via the [[mutation rate]], via the probability of [[sexual reproduction |sexual]] vs. [[asexual reproduction]], via the probability of [[outcrossing]] vs. [[inbreeding]], via [[biological dispersal |dispersal]], and via access to previously cryptic variants through the switching of an [[evolutionary capacitance |evolutionary capacitor]]. A large population size increases the influx of novel mutations each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karasov |first=Talia |author2=Messer, Philipp W. |author3=Petrov, Dmitri A. |author4= Malik, Harmit S. |title=Evidence that Adaptation in Drosophila Is Not Limited by Mutation at Single Sites |journal=PLoS Genetics |date=June 17, 2010 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000924 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000924|pmid=20585551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enhancement of selection==
Rather than creating more phenotypic variation, some mechanisms increase the intensity and effectiveness with which selection acts on existing phenotypic variation.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt; For example:

* Mating rituals that allow [[sexual selection]] on "good genes", and so intensify [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Large [[effective population size]] increasing the threshold value of the [[selection coefficient]] above which selection becomes an important player. This could happen through an increase in the census population size, decreasing [[genetic drift]], through an increase in the recombination rate, decreasing [[genetic draft]], or through changes in the probability distribution of the numbers of offspring..&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Recombination decreasing the importance of the [[Hill-Robertson effect]], where different genotypes contain different adaptive mutations. Recombination brings the two alleles together, creating a super-genotype in place of two competing lineages..&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Shorter generation time.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;

== Robustness and evolvability ==
{{further|Mutational robustness}}

The relationship between robustness and evolvability depends on whether recombination can be ignored.&lt;ref name="Masel 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.06.002 |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Trotter MV |title=Robustness and evolvability |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=406–414 |year=2010 |pmid=20598394 |pmc=3198833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination can generally be ignored in asexual populations and for traits affected by single genes.

=== Without recombination ===

[[Mutational robustness|Robustness in the face of mutation]] does not increase evolvability in the first sense. In organisms with a high level of robustness, mutations have smaller phenotypic effects than in organisms with a low level of robustness. Thus, robustness reduces the amount of heritable genetic variation on which selection can act. However, robustness may allow exploration of large regions of [[fitness landscape |genotype space]], increasing evolvability according to the second sense.&lt;ref name="Wagner 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel 2010" /&gt; Even without genetic diversity, some genotypes have higher evolvability than others, and selection for robustness can increase the "neighborhood richness" of phenotypes that can be accessed from the same starting genotype by mutation. For example, one reason many proteins are less robust to mutation is that they have marginal [[Protein folding|thermodynamic stability]], and most mutations reduce this stability further. Proteins that are more thermostable can tolerate a wider range of mutations and are more evolvable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloom JD, Labthavikul ST, Otey, CR, Arnold FH |title=Protein stability promotes evolvability |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=5869–5874 |year=2006 |pmid=16581913 |pmc=1458665 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510098103 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/15/5869|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.5869B }}&lt;/ref&gt; For polygenic traits, neighborhood richness contributes more to evolvability than does genetic diversity or "spread" across genotype space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rajon |first=E |author2=Masel, J |author2link=Joanna Masel |title=Compensatory Evolution and the Origins of Innovations |journal=Genetics |date=January 18, 2013 |volume=193 |issue=4 |pages=1209–1220 |doi=10.1534/genetics.112.148627 |pmid=23335336 |pmc=3606098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With recombination ===
Temporary robustness, or [[canalisation (genetics) |canalisation]], may lead to the accumulation of significant quantities of cryptic genetic variation. In a new environment or genetic background, this variation may be [[evolutionary capacitance |revealed]] and sometimes be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Masel 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Whitacre and Bender | title=Degeneracy: a design principle for achieving robustness and evolvability | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=263 | issue=1 | pages=143–153 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19925810 | accessdate=2011-03-11 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.11.008 | last2=Bender | first2=Axel | pmid=19925810| arxiv=0907.0510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration ahead of time ==
When [[mutational robustness]] exists, many mutants will persist in a cryptic state. Mutations tend to fall into two categories, having either a very bad effect or very little effect: few mutations fall somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eyre-Walker A, Keightley, PD |title=The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=610–618 |year=2007 |pmid=17637733 |doi=10.1038/nrg2146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fudala A, Korona R | title=Low frequency of mutations with strongly deleterious but nonlethal fitness effects | journal=Evolution | year=2009 |volume=63 | issue=8 | pages=2164–2171 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00713.x | pmid=19473394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, these mutations will not be completely invisible, but still have rare effects, with very low [[penetrance]]. When this happens, natural selection weeds out the very bad mutations, while leaving the others relatively unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Masel | first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Cryptic Genetic Variation Is Enriched for Potential Adaptations | journal=Genetics | volume=172 | issue=3 | pages=1985–1991 | publisher=[[Genetics Society of America]] | location= | date=March 2006 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;artid=1456269 | doi=10.1534/genetics.105.051649 | id= | accessdate = | pmid=16387877 | pmc=1456269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rajon E |author2=Masel J |author2link=Joanna Masel | title=Evolution of molecular error rates and the consequences for evolvability | journal=PNAS | year=2011 |volume=108 | issue=3 | pages=1082–1087 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1012918108 | pmid=21199946 | pmc=3024668 |bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1082R }}&lt;/ref&gt; While evolution has no "foresight" to know which environment will be encountered in the future, some mutations cause major disruption to a basic biological process, and will never be adaptive in any environment. Screening these out in advance leads to [[preadaptation |preadapted]] stocks of cryptic genetic variation.

Another way that phenotypes can be explored, prior to strong genetic commitment, is through learning. An organism that learns gets to "sample" several different phenotypes during its early development, and later sticks to whatever worked best. Later in evolution, the optimal phenotype can be [[genetic assimilation |genetically assimilated]] so it becomes the default behavior rather than a rare behavior. This is known as the [[Baldwin effect]], and it can increase evolvability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hinton GE, Nowlan SJ | title=How learning can guide evolution | journal=Complex Systems | volume=1 |pages=495–502 | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01125.x |vauthors=Borenstein E, Meilijson I, Ruppin E | title=The effect of phenotypic plasticity on evolution in multipeaked fitness landscapes | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=19 |issue=5 | pages=1555–1570 | year=2006 |pmid=16910985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning biases phenotypes in a beneficial direction. But an exploratory flattening of the [[fitness landscape]] can also increase evolvability even when it has no direction, for example when the flattening is a result of random errors in molecular and/or developmental processes. This increase in evolvability can happen when evolution is faced with crossing a "valley" in an [[fitness landscape |adaptive landscape]]. This means that two mutations exist that are deleterious by themselves, but beneficial in combination. These combinations can evolve more easily when the landscape is first flattened, and the discovered phenotype is then fixed by [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00166.x | author=Kim Y | title=Rate of adaptive peak shifts with partial genetic robustness | journal=Evolution | volume=61 | issue=8 | pages=1847–1856 |year=2007 | pmid=17683428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitehead DJ, Wilke CO, Vernazobres D, Bornberg-Bauer E | title=The look-ahead effect of phenotypic mutations | journal=Biology Direct | volume=3 | pages=18 |year=2008 | pmid=18479505 | pmc=2423361 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-18 |url=http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/18 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Griswold CK, Masel J | title=Complex Adaptations Can Drive the Evolution of the Capacitor PSI+, Even with Realistic Rates of Yeast Sex | journal=PLoS Genetics | volume=5 | issue=6 | pages=e1000517 | year=2009 | pmid=19521499 | pmc=2686163 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000517 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000517 | editor1-last=Úbeda | editor1-first=Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modularity==
If every mutation affected every trait, then a mutation that was an improvement for one trait would be a disadvantage for other traits. This means that almost no mutations would be beneficial overall. But if [[pleiotropy]] is restricted to within functional [[modularity |modules]], then mutations affect only one trait at a time, and adaptation is much less constrained. In a modular gene network, for example, a gene that induces a limited set of other genes that control a specific trait under selection may evolve more readily than one that also induces other gene pathways controlling traits not under selection.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson-Manning |first=Carrie |author2=MR Wagner |author3=T Mitchell-Olds |title=Adaptive evolution: Evaluating empirical support for theoretical predictions |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=December 2012 |volume=13 |pages=867–877 |doi=10.1038/nrg3322 |pmid=23154809 |issue=12|pmc=3748133 }}&lt;!-- |accessdate=November 23, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individual genes also exhibit modularity. A mutation in one cis-regulatory element of a gene's promoter region may allow the expression of the gene to be altered only in specific tissues, developmental stages, or environmental conditions rather than changing gene activity in the entire organism simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;

==Evolution of evolvability==
While variation yielding high evolvability could be useful in the long term, in the short term most of that variation is likely to be a disadvantage. For example, naively it would seem that increasing the [[mutation rate]] via a mutator allele would increase evolvability. But as an extreme example, if the mutation rate is too high then all individuals will be dead or at least carry a heavy [[genetic load |mutation load]]. Short-term selection for low variation most of the time is usually thought{{Who |date=February 2016}} likely to be more powerful than long-term selection for evolvability, making it difficult for natural selection to cause the evolution of evolvability. Other forces of selection also affect the generation of variation; for example, mutation and recombination may in part be byproducts of mechanisms to cope with DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michod RE |title=On fitness and adaptedness and their role in evolutionary explanation |journal=J Hist Biol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=289–302 |year=1986 |pmid=11611993 |doi= 10.1007/bf00138880 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When recombination is low, mutator alleles may still sometimes [[genetic hitchhiking |hitchhike]] on the success of adaptive mutations that they cause. In this case, selection can take place at the level of the lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3212376 |author=Eshel I |title=Clone-selection and optimal rates of mutation |journal=Journal of Applied Probability |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=728–738 |year=1973 |jstor=3212376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why mutators are often seen during [[experimental evolution]] of microbes. Mutator alleles can also evolve more easily when they only increase mutation rates in nearby DNA sequences, not across the whole genome: this is known as a contingency locus.

The evolution of evolvability is less controversial if it occurs via the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]], or via the tendency of variation-generating mechanisms to become more active when an organism is stressed. The [[Fungal prions |yeast prion]] [PSI+] may also be an example of the evolution of evolvability through [[evolutionary capacitance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Bergman A |title=The evolution of the evolvability properties of the yeast prion [PSI+] |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=1498–1512 |year=2003 |pmid=12940355 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lancaster AK, Bardill JP, True HL, Masel J |year=2010 |title=The Spontaneous Appearance Rate of the Yeast Prion PSI+ and Its Implications for the Evolution of the Evolvability Properties of the PSI+ System |journal=Genetics |pmid=19917766 |volume=184 |issue=2 |pmc=2828720 |pages=393–400 |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110213}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary capacitor is a switch that turns genetic variation on and off.

==Applications==
Evolvability phenomena have practical applications. For [[protein engineering]] we wish to increase evolvability, and in medicine and agriculture we wish to decrease it. Protein evolvability is defined as the ability of the protein to acquire sequence diversity and conformational flexibility which can enable it to evolve toward a new function.&lt;ref name="SoskineTawfik2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soskine|first1=Misha|last2=Tawfik|first2=Dan S.|title=Mutational effects and the evolution of new protein functions|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=8|year=2010|pages=572–582 |doi=10.1038/nrg2808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of '''forensic epidemiology (FE)''' is a hybrid of principles and practices common to both [[forensic medicine]] and [[epidemiology]]. FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil [[lawsuits]] and criminal prosecution and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Zeegers|first2=Maurice|title=Forensic Epidemiology: Principles and Practices|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124045842|url=http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780124045842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Steven A.|last2=Freeman|first2=Michael D.|date=2014-06-01|title=Forensic epidemiology: a method for investigating and quantifying specific causation|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=217–222|doi=10.1007/s12024-013-9513-8|issn=1556-2891|pmid=24272789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2009-02-01|title=Applied forensic epidemiology: the Bayesian evaluation of forensic evidence in vehicular homicide investigation|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=16|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.08.017|issn=1752-928X|pmid=19135003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2008-07-01|title=Forensic Epidemiology: a systematic approach to probabilistic determinations in disputed matters|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=15|issue=5|pages=281–290|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2007.12.009|issn=1752-928X|pmid=18511002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic epidemiologists formulate [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] probabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of [[causation (law)|causal association]] in civil actions.

Applications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.

== History of FE ==
The term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of bioterrorism in 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US Anthrax attacks of 2001 the CDC defined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.

At the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/SciMan3D12.pdf/$file/SciMan3D12.pdf]

More recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.

== FE Methods and Principles ==

=== Comparative Risk Ratio ===
The metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR).  The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease.  Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based [[relative risk]] (RR) or [[odds ratio]] (OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR  is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20&amp;nbsp;mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR  are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.

In some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and  the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).

Another example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.

=== Attributable Proportion Under the Exposed ===
The attributable proportion under the exposed (AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR &gt;1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; , meets the legal standard of what is “''[[Legal burden of proof|more likely true than not]]'',”  when the RR or CRR is &gt;2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of &gt;1.0), or the AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is &gt;50%. The AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as the "''Probability of Causation'' (PC)" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations ([https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/42cfr81/42cfr81.pdf Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297]) and elsewhere.

=== Causal Methodology ===
Analysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Centeno|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Kohles|first3=Sean S.|date=2009-10-01|title=A systematic approach to clinical determinations of causation in symptomatic spinal disk injury following motor vehicle crash trauma|journal=PM &amp; R: the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=10|pages=951–956|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.07.009|issn=|pmid=19854423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Plausibility: This first step addresses whether it is biologically ''possible'' for the injury event to have caused the condition (a.k.a. general causation), and follows a special application of the viewpoints set forth by Hill (see below). A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the ''frequency'' of the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event, it is still ''plausibly'' caused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis, and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of ''implausibility'' of the relationship. Plausibility is often, but not necessarily, established with epidemiologic data or information.
# Temporality: This second step examines the clinical and other evidence of the timing between the onset of the symptoms of injury and the injury event, and must be satisfied to assess specific causation. First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be either too latent or insufficiently latent, depending on the nature of the exposure and outcome.
# Lack of a more probable alternative explanation: This final step examines the probability of the injury condition occurring at the same point in time in the individual, given what is known about the individual from the review of medical records and other evidence, but in the absence of the injury event (a.k.a. differential diagnosis). First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for risk (often via analysis of epidemiologic data). Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed, given the known history of the individual.

==== United States Case Law on Injury Causation Methodology ====
The 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in ''Etherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company.''[https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/colorado/codce/1:2010cv00892/118960/145] The defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the Court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The Court denied the Defendant’s motion to strike the expert’s testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/3l/l4.

The Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the [[Daubert standard]].  See ''Etherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company'', No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/l9/l6)[https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-1164.pdf].

==== The Hill Viewpoints ====
[[Biological plausibility|Plausibility]] of an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the [[Bradford Hill criteria|Hill criteria]], named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine “viewpoints” by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=A. B.|date=1965-05-01|title=THE ENVIRONMENT AND DISEASE: ASSOCIATION OR CAUSATION?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=58|pages=295–300|issn=0035-9157|pmc=1898525|pmid=14283879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill declined to call his viewpoints “criteria”  lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term “ Hill criteria”  is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:
* Coherence: A causal conclusion should not contradict present substantive knowledge. It should “ make sense”  given current knowledge
* Analogy: The results of a previously described causal relationship may be translatable to the circumstances of a current investigation
* Consistency: The repeated observation of the investigated relationship in different circumstances or across a number of studies lends strength to a causal inference
* Specificity: The degree to which the exposure is associated with a particular outcome
* Biological plausibility: The extent to which the observed association can be explained by known scientific principles
* Experiment: In some cases there may be evidence from randomized experiments (''i.e.'', drug trials)
* Dose response: The probability, frequency, or severity of the outcome increases with increased amount of exposure
[[File:Assessing the role of a confounder.png|thumb|The triangular relationship between exposure, outcome, and confounder. When investigating whether there is a causal relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest, the influence of extraneous variables needs to be taken into account. A confounder is defined as a concurrent cause of the outcome under investigation that is related to, but not a consequence of, the exposure of interest.]]
Subsequent authors have added the feature of [[Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge|Challenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge]] for circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of [[confounding]] and [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are [[selection bias]], which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and [[Information bias (epidemiology)|information bias]], which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.

In many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality  and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (''i.e.'', the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires &gt;12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.

=== Test Accuracy ===
Test accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] (the rate at which the test is positive when the condition is present) TP/(TP + FN)
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] (the rate at which the test is negative when the condition is absent) TN/(TN + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Positive predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is present when the test is positive) TP/(TP + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Negative predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is absent when the test is negative) TN/(TN + FN)

=== Bayesian Reasoning ===
Probability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one’s self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is, ''what is most likely'', for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition”  the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian reasoning]], named for [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] or Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’  Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.

=== Post-test Probability and Positive Predictive Value ===
The [[Pre- and post-test probability|post-test probability]] is a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:
[[File:Post-test probability.png|thumb|Post-test probability equation]]
The equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.

'''GNS Science''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: '''Te Pū Ao''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[Crown Research Institutes|Crown Research Institute]]. It focuses on [[geology]], [[geophysics]] (including [[seismology]] and [[volcanology]]), and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear science]] (particularly [[ion beam|ion-beam technologies]], [[isotope|isotope science]] and [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]]).

GNS Science was known as the '''Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences''' (IGNS) from 1992 to 2005. Originally part of the New Zealand Government's [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR), it was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were set up in 1992.&lt;ref name="CRIact" &gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0047/latest/DLM264292.html], Crown Research Institutes Act 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that process, GNS Science became semi-commercial, and {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} operates as a government-owned company rather than as a government department. This change led to greater autonomy, accompanied by greater emphasis on financial viability. This is essential in the [[corporation | corporate environment]], especially for the purchase and maintenance of research equipment and infrastructure, because the New Zealand public science funding system doesn't normally provide grants for these purposes. 

As well as undertaking basic research, and operating the national geological hazards monitoring network (GeoNet)&lt;ref name="geonet"&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/], GeoNet Hazards Monitoring Network.&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Isotope Centre (NIC),&lt;ref&gt;

'''Gel electrophoresis''' is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules ([[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s) and their fragments, based on their size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]] to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kryndushkin DS, Alexandrov IM, Ter-Avanesyan MD, Kushnirov VV | title= Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104  |journal= Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 278 |issue= 49 |pages= 49636–43  |year=2003 |pmid= 14507919 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M307996200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an [[electric field]] to move the negatively charged molecules through a matrix of [[agarose]] or other substances. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving.&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proteins are separated by charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins.  Gel electrophoresis can also be used for separation of [[nanoparticle]]s.

Gel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium or sieving medium during electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied.&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L |title = Biochemistry|edition = 5th|publisher = WH Freeman|year = 2002|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&amp;rid=stryer.section.438#455|isbn = 0-7167-4955-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), but may be used as a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as [[mass spectrometry]], [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]], PCR, [[cloning]], [[DNA sequencing]], or [[Southern blot]]ting for further characterization.

==Physical basis==
{{See also|electrophoresis}}
[[Image:SDS-PAGE_Electrophoresis.png|thumb|500px|Overview of Gel Electrophoresis.]]
In simple terms, [[electrophoresis]] is a process which enables the sorting of molecules based on size. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) can be made to move through a gel made of [[agarose]] or [[polyacrylamide]]. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel, and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The term "[[gel]]" in this instance refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a [[crosslinked polymer]] whose composition and porosity is chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating [[protein]]s or small [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA]], [[RNA]], or [[oligonucleotide]]s) the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of [[acrylamide]] and a [[cross-linker]], producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred [[base (chemistry)|bases]]), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid, yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a [[neurotoxin]] and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrate without cross links resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and [[affinity electrophoresis|macromolecular complexes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Electrophoresis refers to the [[electromotive force]] (EMF) that is used to move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the [[cathode]] which is negatively charged (because this is an [[Electrolytic cell|electrolytic]] rather than [[galvanic cell]]). If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biochemical Techniques Theory and Practice|publisher=Waveland Press|year=1990|isbn= 0-88133-556-8|author1=Robyt, John F.  |author2=White, Bernard J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If several samples have been loaded into adjacent wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending on the number of different molecules, each lane shows separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or to indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Bands in different lanes that end up at the same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel with the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are [[molecular weight size marker]]s available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown in order to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the size of the molecule.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are limits to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially if you are trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_3133.pdf|title=Molecular Weight Determination by SDS-PAGE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

==Types of gel==

The types of gel most typically used are agarose and polyacrylamide gels.  Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of analyte.  Polyacrylamide gels are usually used for proteins, and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp).   Agarose gels on the other hand have lower resolving power for DNA but have greater range of separation, and are therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Tom Maniatis |author2=E. F. Fritsch |author3=Joseph Sambrook |edition=3rd |volume=1 |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.2–5.3  |isbn=978-0879691363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polyacrylamide gels are run in a vertical configuration while agarose gels are typically run horizontally in a submarine mode.  They also differ in their casting methodology, as agarose sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.

===Agarose===
{{main|Agarose gel electrophoresis}}
Agarose gels are made from the natural [[polysaccharide]] [[polymer]]s extracted from [[seaweed]].
Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices, because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

Agarose gels do not have a uniform pore size, but are optimal for electrophoresis of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smisek | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Hoagland | first2 = D. A. | doi = 10.1021/ma00195a048 | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis of high molecular weight, synthetic polyelectrolytes | journal = Macromolecules | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 2270–2277 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1989MaMol..22.2270S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agarose gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 [[base pair]] to several megabases (millions of bases), the largest of which require specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent agarose in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days.  Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a [[Pulsed field gel electrophoresis|pulsed field electrophoresis]] (PFE), or [[field inversion electrophoresis]].

"Most agarose gels are made with between 0.7% (good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments) agarose dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agarose gel electrophoresis (basic method)|url=http://www.methodbook.net/dna/agarogel.html|work=Biological Protocols|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyacrylamide===
{{main|Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}}

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is used for separating proteins ranging in size from 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform pore size provided by the polyacrylamide gel. Pore size is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.

Traditional [[DNA sequencing]] techniques such as [[Dideoxy termination#Maxam-Gilbert sequencing|Maxam-Gilbert]] or [[Dideoxy termination#Chain termination method|Sanger]] methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used in the field of [[immunology]] and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or [[isoforms]] of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a [[nitrocellulose]] or [[PVDF]] membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a [[western blot]].

Typically [[resolving gels]] are made in 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 15%.  Stacking gel (5%) is poured on top of the resolving gel and a gel comb (which forms the wells and defines the lanes where proteins, sample buffer and ladders will be placed) is inserted.  The percentage chosen depends on the size of the protein that one wishes to identify or probe in the sample. The smaller the known weight, the higher the percentage that should be used. Changes on the buffer system of the gel can help to further resolve proteins of very small sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schägger|first=Hermann|title=Tricine–SDS-PAGE|journal=Nature Protocols|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–22|doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.4|pmid=17406207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starch===

Partially [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] potato starch makes for another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis. The gels are slightly more opaque than acrylamide or agarose. Non-denatured proteins can be separated according to charge and size. They are visualised using Napthal Black or Amido Black staining. Typical starch gel concentrations are 5% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gordon |first=A.H. |year=1975 |title=Electrophoresis of proteins in polyacrylamide and starch gels |publisher=American Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smithies"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smithies |first=O. |year=1955 |title=Zone electrophoresis in starch gels: group variations in the serum proteins of normal adults |journal=Biochem.

==Gel conditions==

===Denaturing===
[[File:TTGE profiles representing the bifidobacterial diversity of fecal samples journal pone 0050257 g004.png|thumb|400px|TTGE profiles representing the bifidobacterial diversity of fecal samples from two healthy volunteers (A and B) before and after AMC (Oral Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid) treatment]]

[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturing]] gels are run under conditions that disrupt the natural structure of the analyte, causing it to unfold into a linear chain.  Thus, the mobility of each [[macromolecule]] depends only on its linear length and its mass-to-charge ratio.  Thus, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of [[biomolecular structure]] are disrupted, leaving only the primary structure to be analyzed.

Nucleic acids are often denatured by including [[urea]] in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]], usually as part of the [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|SDS-PAGE]] process.  For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent [[disulfide bond]]s that stabilize their [[tertiary structure|tertiary]] and [[quaternary structure]], a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of [[beta-mercaptoethanol]] or [[dithiothreitol]]. For general analysis of protein samples, reducing PAGE is the most common form of [[protein electrophoresis]].

Denaturing conditions are necessary for proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its [[electrophoretic mobility]]. [[Urea]], [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and [[glyoxal]] are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure.

===Native===

[[File:Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase activity stain.jpg|thumb|Specific enzyme-linked staining: [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase]]  [[Isozyme|isoenzymes]] in ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' infected [[Red blood cell]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hempelmann E, Wilson RJ |title= Detection of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in malarial parasites | journal = Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology | volume = 2 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 197–204| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166685181901006  |pmid = 7012616 | doi=10.1016/0166-6851(81)90100-6 |year= 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Native gels are run in non-denaturing conditions, so that the analyte's natural structure is maintained.  This allows the physical size of the folded or assembled complex to affect the mobility, allowing for analysis of all four levels of the biomolecular structure.  For biological samples, detergents are used only to the extent that they are necessary to [[lysis|lyse]] [[lipid bilayer|lipid membranes]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Complexes remain—for the most part—associated and folded as they would be in the cell. One downside, however, is that complexes may not separate cleanly or predictably, as it is difficult to predict how the molecule's shape and size will affect its mobility. Addressing and solving this problem is a major aim of [[QPNC-PAGE|quantitative native PAGE]].

Unlike denaturing methods, native gel electrophoresis does not use a charged [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] agent. The molecules being separated (usually [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acids]]) therefore differ not only in [[molecular mass]] and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on the shape of the overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state they may be visualised not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining.

A specific experiment example of an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify the presence of the enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR Diazonium salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually ran next to commercial purified samples in order to visualize the results and make confusions of whether or not purification was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamental Approaches to Biochemistry and Biotechnology|vauthors = Ninfa AJ, Ballou DP, |publisher=Bethesda, Md: Fitzgerald Science Press|year=1998|isbn= 9781891786006|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native state|Native]] gel electrophoresis is typically used in [[proteomics]] and [[metallome|metallomics]]. However, native PAGE is also used to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in [[Single-strand conformation polymorphism]].

==Buffers==
Buffers in gel electrophoresis are used to provide ions that carry a current and to maintain the pH at a relatively constant value.
These buffers have plenty of ions in them, which is necessary for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander J.|last2=Ballou|first2=David P.|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=0470087668|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE), [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]], which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat)  matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | pmid = 15351274 | doi=10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | volume=333 | issue=1 | title=History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis |date=October 2004 | journal=Anal. Biochem. | pages=1–13 |vauthors=Brody JR, Kern SE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most SDS-PAGE protein separations are performed using a [[Gel electrophoresis of proteins#Buffer systems|"discontinuous" (or DISC) buffer system]] that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band in a process called [[isotachophoresis]]. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, "resolving" region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins.

==Visualization==
{{Further|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids#Visualization|Gel electrophoresis of proteins#Visualization}}

After the electrophoresis is complete, the molecules in the gel can be [[staining (biology)|stained]] to make them visible. DNA may be visualized using [[ethidium bromide]] which, when intercalated into DNA, [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light, while protein may be visualised using [[silver stain]] or [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] dye. Other methods may also be used to visualize the separation of the mixture's components on the gel. If the molecules to be separated contain [[radioactivity]], for example in a [[DNA sequencing]] gel, an [[isotopic tracer|autoradiogram]] can be recorded of the gel.  [[Photograph]]s can be taken of gels, often using a [[Gel Doc]] system.

==Downstream processing==

After separation, an additional separation method may then be used, such as [[isoelectric focusing]] or [[SDS-PAGE]]. The gel will then be physically cut, and the protein complexes extracted from each portion separately. Each extract may then be analysed, such as by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] or [[de novo peptide sequencing]] after [[in-gel digestion]]. This can provide a great deal of information about the identities of the proteins in a complex.

==Applications==
*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following restriction enzyme digestion, e.g. in [[restriction enzyme|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.
*Analysis of [[PCR]] products, e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]
*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].

Gel electrophoresis is used in [[Forensic chemistry|forensics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. The results can be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer operated camera, and the intensity of the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.

Depending on the type of analysis being performed, other techniques are often implemented in conjunction with the results of gel electrophoresis, providing a wide range of field-specific applications.

===Nucleic acids===
{{Main|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids}}

[[File:Pcr gel.png|thumb|An agarose gel of a [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] product compared to a DNA ladder.]]

In the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the naturally occurring negative charge carried by their [[sugar]]-[[phosphate]] backbone.&lt;ref name=Lodish&gt;{{cite book|author = Lodish H|title = Molecular Cell Biology|edition = 5th|publisher = WH Freeman: New York, NY|year = 2004|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&amp;rid=mcb.section.1637#1648|isbn = 978-0-7167-4366-8|author2 = Berk A|author3 = Matsudaira P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Double-stranded DNA fragments naturally behave as long rods, so their migration through the gel is relative to their size or, for cyclic fragments, their [[radius of gyration]]. Circular DNA such as [[plasmid]]s, however, may show multiple bands, the speed of migration may depend on whether it is relaxed or supercoiled.  Single-stranded DNA or RNA tend to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the [[hydrogen bond]]s, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[formamide]], are used to denature the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.&lt;ref&gt;Troubleshooting DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Focus 19:3 p.66 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gel electrophoresis of large [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] is usually done by agarose gel electrophoresis. See the "[[Chain termination method]]" page for an example of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift [[affinity electrophoresis]].

Electrophoresis of RNA samples can be used to check for genomic DNA contamination and also for RNA degradation. RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as intense as the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharply defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and intensity ratio is less than 2:1.

===Proteins===
{{Main|Gel electrophoresis of proteins}}

[[File:SDSPAGE.png|thumb|right|'''SDS-PAGE [[autoradiography]]''' – The indicated proteins are present in different concentrations in the two samples.]]
[[Protein]]s, unlike nucleic acids, can have varying charges and complex shapes, therefore they may not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] in the presence of a [[detergent]] such as [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge.&lt;ref name=Stryer /&gt; Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.&lt;ref name=Stryer /&gt;

[[Protein]]s are usually analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ([[SDS-PAGE]]), by [[Native Gel Electrophoresis|native gel electrophoresis]], by preparative gel electrophoresis ([[QPNC-PAGE]]), or by [[2-D electrophoresis]].

Characterization through ligand interaction may be performed by [[electroblotting]] or by [[affinity electrophoresis]] in agarose or by [[capillary electrophoresis]] as for estimation of [[binding constant]]s and determination of structural features like [[glycan]] content through [[lectin]] binding.

Bier states: "The method of Smithies ... is finding wide application because of its unique separatory power." Taken in context, Bier clearly implies that Smithies' method is an improvement.

(Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state.

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God, A Guide for the Perplexed''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Keith Ward]] arguing the compatibility between [[science]] and [[religion]]. 

In seven chapters [[Keith Ward]] takes the reader through the history of mankind's religious thought. He shows how philosophical questions have always been linked with religious questions, and how religion has never been merely a set of rules or doctrines, but a quest for meaning and a search for the blazing darkness that is God. Ward also discusses [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].  While the academic ground is covered lightly, the mystical, poetic and mysterious side of religion is also given due weight. The content is similar to, though the tone adopted is different from, [[Don Cupitt]]'s ''[[The Sea of Faith]]''.

The '''Great Transition''' is a term used by the Great Transition Initiative and its predecessor, the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), to describe a vision of a just and sustainable global future. The term was originally coined by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in ''The Meaning of the 20th Century – The Great Transition'' (1964) and describes the shift from [[Pre-Modern|pre-modern]] to post-modern culture, and the four possible courses of action that these organizations believe will allow humanity to successfully manage the Great Transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8YSAAAACAAJ}}|title=The Meaning of the 20th Century: The Great Transition|last=Boulding|first=Kenneth Ewart|publisher=University Press of America|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8191-7102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of the Great Transition vision include egalitarian social and ecological values, increased inter-human connectivity, improved [[quality of life]], and a healthy planet, as well as the absence of poverty, war and environmental destruction. The Great Transition concept was cited by [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]] [[Jigme Thinley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Thinly, [http://www.cabinet.gov.bt/?page_id=207 "Address by the Prime Minister on Well-Being and Happiness,"] UN Headquarters, New York, April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ryan-Collins of the [[New Economics Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ryan-Collins, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/the-great-transition ''Great Transition''] (London: New Economics Foundation, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Capital Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisymposium.com/ The Capital Institute Symposium: "Beyond Sustainability: The Road to Regenerative Capitalism] New York, June 20–21, 2013, &lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a theme for the 2011 SmartCSOs conference on strategies for Civil Society Organisations in London.&lt;ref&gt;SmartCSOs, [http://www.veblen-institute.org/Effective-change-strategies-for ''Effective Change Strategies for the Great Transition: Five Leverage Points for Civil Society Organisations''] Berlin: Smart CSOs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Great Transition was first introduced by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an international body of scientists convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] to examine the requirements for a transition to a sustainable global society. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html and Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, [http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''] (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Transition Initiative==

Further development of Great Transition scenarios is carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). Launched in 2003, GTI is a global network of several hundred scholars, intellectuals, civil society leaders, and activists working to develop visions and pathways for a “Great Transition" to a future of equity, solidarity and ecological sustainability. The Initiative was relaunched as an online journal and discussion network in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38402">The '''history of herbalism''' is closely tied with the [[history of medicine]] from prehistoric times up until the development of the [[germ theory of disease]] in the 19th century. Modern medicine from the 19th century to today has been based on [[evidence]] gathered using the [[scientific method]]. Evidence-based use of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, often derived from [[medicinal plant]]s, has largely replaced herbal treatments in modern health care. However, many people continue to employ various forms of [[traditional medicine|traditional]] or [[alternative medicine]]. These systems often have a significant herbal component. The history of [[herbalism]] also overlaps with [[food history]], as many of the herbs and spices historically used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds,&lt;ref name="tapsell"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, etal |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future |journal=Med.

==Prehistory==
The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. [[Archaeological]] evidence indicates that humans were using medicinal plants during the [[Paleolithic]], approximately 60,000 years ago. (Furthermore, other non-human [[primates]] are also known to ingest medicinal plants to treat illness)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant samples gathered from prehistoric burial sites have been thought to support the claim that Paleolithic peoples had knowledge of herbal medicine. For instance, a 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, "[[Shanidar Cave#Shanidar 4.2C the .22flower burial.22|Shanidar IV]]", in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from 8 plant species, 7 of which are used now as herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Solecki, Ralph S.|title=Shanidar IV, a Neanderthal Flower Burial in Northern Iraq|work=Science|volume=190|issue=4217|date=November 1975|pages=880–881|doi = 10.1126/science.190.4217.880|bibcode=1975Sci...190..880S}}).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Paul B. Pettitt]] has written that "A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent Meriones tersicus, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pettitt |first=Paul B. |date=2002 |title=The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in middle paleolithic eurasia. |url=http://arheo.ffzg.unizg.hr/ska/tekstovi/neanderthal_dead.pdf |journal=Before Farming |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=19 note 8 |doi= |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicinal herbs were found in the personal effects of ''[[Ötzi the Iceman]]'', whose body was frozen in the [[Ötztal Alps]] for more than 5,000 years. These herbs appear to have been used to treat the parasites found in his intestines.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Ancient history==
[[File:PEbers c41-bc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ebers Papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE) from [[ancient Egypt]] has a prescription for ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' (marijuana) applied topically for [[inflammation]].]]

=== Mesopotamia ===
In [[Mesopotamia]], the written study of herbs dates back over 5,000 years to the [[Sumer]]ians, who created clay tablets with lists of hundreds of medicinal plants (such as [[myrrh]] and [[opium]]).&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Ancient Egyptian texts are of particular interest due to the language and translation controversies that accompany texts from this era and region. These differences in conclusions stem from the lack of complete knowledge of the Egyptian language: many translations are composed of mere approximations between Egyptian and modern ideas, and there can never be complete certainty of meaning or context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ancient Egyptian Medicine|last = Nunn|first = J.F|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0-8061-2831-3|location = Norman|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While physical documents are scarce, texts such as the [[Ebers Papyrus|Papyrus Ebers]] serve to illuminate and relieve some of the conjecture surrounding ancient herbal practices. The Papyrus consists of lists of ailments and their treatments, ranging from "disease of the limbs" to "diseases of the skin"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=THE |url=http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |date=2005-02-26 |accessdate=2015-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226100008/http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has information on over 850 plant medicines, including [[garlic]], [[juniper]], [[cannabis]], [[castor bean]], [[aloe]], and [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]].&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p17" /&gt; Treatments were mainly aimed at ridding the patient of the most prevalent symptoms because the symptoms were largely regarded as the disease itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Medical Features of the Papyrus Ebers|last = Von Klein|first = Carl H.|publisher = Press of the American Medical Association|year = 1905|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the collection and preparation of such remedies are mostly unknown, as many of the texts available for translation assume the physician already has some knowledge of how treatments are conducted and therefore such techniques would not need restating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though modern understanding of Egyptian [[herbal]]s stem form the translation of ancient texts, there is no doubt that trade and politics carried the Egyptian tradition to regions across the world, influencing and evolving many cultures medical practices and allowing for a glimpse into the world of ancient Egyptian medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Herbs used by Egyptian healers were mostly indigenous in origin, although some were imported from other regions like Lebanon. Other than papyri, evidence of herbal medicine has also been found in tomb illustrations or jars containing traces of herbs.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nunn|first=John|title=Ancient Egyptian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfEnVU6z8IC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2002|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3504-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In India, [[Ayurveda]] medicine has used many herbs such as [[turmeric]] possibly as early as 4,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veterinary Herbal Medicine|page=60|author1=Susan G.

The ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC describes 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Girish Dwivedi |first=Shridhar Dwivedi |year=2007 |title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence |publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]] |url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010045900/http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In China, seeds likely used for herbalism have been found in the archaeological sites of [[Bronze Age]] China dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong |first=Francis |title=History of Medicine in China |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=7984 |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201231218/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological Chinese emperor [[Shennong]] is said to have written the first [[Chinese herbology|Chinese pharmacopoeia]], the "[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing]]". The "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" lists 365 medicinal plants and their uses - including [[Ephedra]] (the shrub that introduced the drug [[ephedrine]] to modern medicine), [[hemp]], and [[chaulmoogra]] (one of the first effective treatments for leprosy).&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding generations augmented on the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'', as in the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs''), a 7th-century [[Tang Dynasty]] treatise on herbal medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wu, Jing-Nuan|title=An Illustrated Chinese Materia Medica|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780195140170|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9Q8agQrJR0C&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===

==== Hippocrates ====
The ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]'' serves as a collection of texts that are associated with the 'Father of Western Medicine', [[Hippocrates|Hippocrates of Kos]]. Though the actual authorship of some of these texts is disputed, each reflects the general ideals put forth by Hippocrates and his followers. The recipes and remedies included in parts of the ''Corpus'' no doubt reveal popular and prevalent treatments of the early ancient Greek period.

Though any of the herbals included in the ''Corpus'' are similar to those practiced in the religious sectors of healing, they differ strikingly in the lack of rites, prayers, or chants used in the application of remedies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hippocratic Recipes: Oral and Written Transmission of Pharmacological Knowledge in Fifth and Fourth Century Greece|last = Totelin|first = Laurence M.V|publisher = Brill|year = 2009|isbn = 978-90-474-2486-4 |location = Leiden and Boston|pages = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is truly indicative of the Hippocratic preference for logic and reason within the practices of medicine.

The ingredients mentioned in the ''Corpus'' consist of a myriad of herbs, both local to Greece and imported from exotic locales such as Arabia. While many imported goods would have been too expensive for common household use, some of the suggested ingredients include the more common and cheaper [[Sambucus|elderberries]] and [[Hypericum perforatum|St. John's Wort]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]], a Greek physician practicing in Rome, was certainly prolific in his attempt to write down his knowledge on all things medical – and in his pursuit, he wrote many texts regarding herbs and their properties, most notably his ''[[Galenic corpus|Works of Therapeutics]]''. In this text, Galen outlines the merging of each discipline within medicine that combine to restore health and prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Galen|last = Hankinson|first = R.J|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-139-82691-4|location = Cambridge|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ygBactKUkAMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = Therapeutics- Van Der Eijk}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the subject of therapeutics encompasses a wide array of topics, Galen's extensive work in the [[humors]] and four basic qualities helped pharmacists to better calibrate their remedies for the individual person and their unique symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Galen|last = Hankinson|first = R.J|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9781139826914|location = Cambridge|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ygBactKUkAMC&amp;pg=PT414&amp;lpg=PT414&amp;dq=sabine+vogt+companion+to+galen#v=onepage&amp;q=sabine%20vogt%20companion%20to%20galen&amp;f=false|chapter = Drugs and Pharmacology- Vogt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diocles of Carystus ====
The writings of [[Diocles of Carystus]] were also extensive and prolific in nature. With enough prestige to be referred to as "the second Hippocrates", his advice in herbalism and treatment was to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2181272|title = Diocles of Carystus: A New Pupil of Aristotle|last = Jaeger|first = Werner|date = July 1, 1940|journal = The Philosophical Review|doi = 10.2307/2181272|pmid =|volume=49|pages=393–414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original texts no longer exist, many medical scholars throughout the ages have quoted Diocles rather extensively, and it is in these fragments that we gain knowledge of his writings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diocles of Carystus: A Collection of the Fragments with Translation and Commentary|last = Eijk|first = Philip J|publisher = Brill|year = 2000|isbn = 978-90-04-10265-1|location = |pages = vii|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tHc5MOlMbzkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is purported that Diocles actually wrote the first comprehensive herbal- this work then cited numerous times by contemporaries such as Galen, [[Celsus]], and [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Pliny ====
In what is one of the first encyclopedic texts, [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' serves as a comprehensive guide to nature and also presents an extensive catalog of herbs valuable in medicine.  With over 900 drugs and plants listed, Pliny's writings provide a very large knowledge base upon which we may learn more about ancient herbalism and medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural History|last = The Elder|first = Pliny|publisher = W. Heinemann|year = 1938|isbn = |location = London|pages = |last2 = Rackham|first2 = Harris|url = https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory03plinuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny himself referred to ailments as "the greatest of all the operations of nature," and the act of treatment via drugs as impacting the "state of peace or of war which exists between the various departments of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Natural History of Pliny|last = The Elder|first = Pliny|publisher = H.G.

==== Dioscordes ====
Much like Pliny, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] constructed a pharmacopeia, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', consisting of over 1000 medicines produced form herbs, minerals, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Materia Medica, Pharamcy, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics|last = Hale-White|first = William|publisher = J. and A.

Similarly important for herbalists and botanists of later centuries was [[Theophrastus]]' ''Historia Plantarum'', written in the 4th century BC, which was the first systematization of the botanical world.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|volume=27|page=787 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philobio11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grene|first=Marjorie|title=The philosophy of biology: an episodic history|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64380-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJSGJjh8Jo8C&amp;pg=PA11|page=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}

While there are certainly texts from the medieval period that denote the uses of herbs, there has been a long-standing debate between scholars as to the actual motivations and understandings that underline the creation of [[herbal]] documents during the medieval period.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 230791 |title = Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons |last = Voigts |first = Linda E. |date = June 1, 1979 |journal = Isis |issue = 2 |volume = 70 |pages = 255, 252, 254|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first point of view dictates that the information presented in these medieval texts were merely copied from their classical equivalents without much thought or understanding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The second viewpoint, which is gaining traction among modern scholars, states that herbals were copied for actual use and backed by genuine understanding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some evidence for the suggestion that [[herbal]]s were utilized with knowledgeable intent, was the addition of several chapters of plants, lists of symptoms, habitat information, and plant synonyms added to texts such as the ''[[Herbarium vivum|Herbarium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Medieval Herbal Remedies: the Old English Herbarium and Anglo-Saxon Medicine |last = Van Arsdall|first = Anne |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002|isbn = |location = New York |pages = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts utilized in this time period include [[Bald's Leechbook]], the [[Lacnunga]], the peri didaxeon, [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Herbarium Apulei]], Da Taxone, and Madicina de Quadrupedidus, while the most popular during this time period were the Ex Herbis Femininis, the Herbarius, and works by [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]].

[[Benedictine monasteries]] were the primary source of medical knowledge in [[Europe]] and [[England]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. However, most of these monastic scholars' efforts were focused on translating and copying ancient Greco-Roman and Arabic works, rather than creating substantial new information and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arsdall, Anne V. |title=Medieval Herbal Remedies: The Old English Herbarium and Anglo-Saxon Medicine |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780415938495 |pages=70–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITxsaqEmVHAC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mills, Frank A. |chapter=Botany |editor=Johnston, William M. |title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism: M-Z |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=9781579580902 |page=179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfC0TDkJJNgC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek and Roman writings on medicine, as on other subjects, were preserved by  hand copying of manuscripts in monasteries. The monasteries thus tended to become local centers of medical knowledge, and their [[herb garden]]s provided the raw materials for simple treatment of common disorders. At the same time, folk medicine in the home and village continued uninterrupted, supporting numerous wandering and settled herbalists. Among these were the "wise-women" and "wise men", who prescribed herbal remedies often along with spells, enchantments, divination and advice. It was not until the [[late Middle Ages]] that women and men who were knowledgeable in herb lore became the targets of the witch hysteria. One of the most famous women in the herbal tradition was [[Hildegard of Bingen]].  A 12th-century Benedictine nun, she wrote a medical text called ''Causae et Curae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramos-e-Silva Marcia | year = 1999 | title = Saint Hildegard Von Bingen (1098–1179)  "The Light Of Her People And Of Her Time" | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 315–320 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00617.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truitt Elly R | year = 2009 | title = The Virtues Of Balm In Late Medieval Literature| journal = Early Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 711–736 | doi=10.1163/138374209x12542104913966| url = http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=history_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time, herbalism was mainly practiced by women, particularly among Germanic tribes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |title = History of Western Herbalism {{!}} Dr. Christopher Hobbs |url = http://www.christopherhobbs.com/library/featured-articles/history-of-western-herbalism/ |website = www.christopherhobbs.com |accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three major sources of information on healing at the time including the Arabian School, Anglo-Saxon leechcraft, and Salerno. A great scholar of the Arabian School was [[Avicenna]], who wrote ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' which became the standard medical reference work of the Arab world. "''The Canon of Medicine'' is known for its introduction of systematic experimentation and the study of physiology, the discovery of contagious diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, the introduction of quarantine to limit the spread of infectious diseases, the introduction of experimental medicine, clinical trials, and the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases. ...''The Canon'' includes a description of some 760 medicinal plants and the medicine that could be derived from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = A History of Herbalism for Herbalists, Part 1: How the Arabs Saved Greek Sciences|url = https://www.planetherbs.com/case-studies/a-history-of-herbalism-for-herbalists-part-1-how-the-arabs-saved-greek-sciences.html|website = www.planetherbs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Leechcraft, though bringing to mind part of their treatments, leech was the English term for medical practitioner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Salerno was a famous school in Italy centered around health and medicine. A student of the school was [[Constantine the African]], credited with bringing Arab medicine to Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Translation of herbals==

During the Middle Ages, the study of plants began to be based on critical observations. "In the 16th and 17th century an interest in [[botany]] revived in Europe and spread to America by way of European conquest and colonization."&lt;ref name="Moore, R. 1998"&gt;Moore, R. (1998). Botany (2nd ed.). New York: WCB/McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers started to act as herbalists and academic professors studied plants with great depth. [[Herbalism|Herbalists]] began to explore the use of plants for both medicinal purposes and agricultural uses. [[Botany|Botanists]] in the Middle Ages were known as herbalists; they collected, grew, dried, stored, and sketched plants. Many became experts in identifying and describing plants according to their morphology and habitats, as well as their usefulness. These books, called [[herbal]]s included beautiful drawings and paintings of plants as well as their uses.

At that time both botany and the art of gardening stressed the utility of plants for man; the popular herbal, described the medical uses of plants.&lt;ref name="Moore, R. 1998"/&gt; During the Middle Ages, there was an expansion of book culture that spread through the medieval world. The phenomenon of translation is well-documented, from its beginnings as a scholarly endeavor in Baghdad as early as the eighth century to its expansion throughout European Mediterranean centers of scholarship by the eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, E. R. 2012"&gt;Hoffman, E. R. (2012). Translating Image and Text in the Medieval Mediterranean World between the Tenth and Thirteenth Centuries. Medieval Encounters, 18(4/5), 584–623. {{doi|10.1163/15700674-12342120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of translation is collaborative effort, requiring a variety of people to translate and add to them. However, how the Middle Ages viewed nature seems to be a mystery.

Translation of text and image has provided numerous versions and compilations of individual manuscripts from diverse sources, old and new. Translation is a dynamic process as well as a scholarly endeavor that contributed great to science in the Middle Ages; the process naturally entailed continuous revisions and additions.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, E. R. 2012"/&gt; The Benedictine monasteries were known for their in-depth knowledge of herbals. These gardens grew the herbs which were considered to be useful for the treatment of the various human ills; the beginnings of modern medical education can be connected with monastic influence.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"&gt;Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, And Discoveries Of The Middle Ages And The Renaissance [e-book]. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press; 2004. Available from: eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Retrieved April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Monastic academies were developed and monks were taught how to translate Greek manuscripts into Latin.

Knowledge of medieval botanicals was closely related to medicine because the plant's principal use was for remedies.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D. C. 2007"&gt;Lindberg, D. C. (2007). The beginnings of Western science: the European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbals were structured by the names of the plants, identifying features, medicinal parts of plant, therapeutic properties, and some included instructions on how to prepare and use them. For medical use of herbals to be effective, a manual was developed. Dioscorides' ''De material medica'' was a significant herbal designed for practical purposes.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D. C. 2007"/&gt;

Theophrastus wrote more than 200 papers describing the characteristics of over 500 plants. He developed a classification system for plants based on their morphology such as their form and structure.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt;  He described in detail pepper, cinnamon, bananas, asparagus, and cotton. Two of his best-known works, ''Enquiry into Plants'' and ''The Causes of Plants'', have survived for many centuries and were translated into Latin. He has been referred to as the "grandfather of botany".&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt; Crateuas was the first to produce a pharmacological book for medicinal plants, and his book influenced medicine for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt; A Greek physician, Pedanius Dioscorides described over 600 different kinds of plants and describes their useful qualities for herbal medicine, and his illustrations were used for pharmacology and medicine as late as the Renaissance years.

Monasteries established themselves as centers for medical care. Information on these herbals and how to use them was passed on from monks to monks, as well as their patients.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"&gt;Arsdall, A. (2002). Medieval herbal remedies: the Old English herbarium and Anglo-Saxon medicine. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These illustrations were of no use to everyday individuals; they were intended to be complex and for people with prior knowledge and understanding of herbal. The usefulness of these herbals have been questioned because they appear to be unrealistic and several plants are depicted claiming to cure the same condition, as “the modern world does not like such impression."&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt; When used by experienced healers, these plants can provide their many uses. For these medieval healers, no direction was needed their background allowed them to choose proper plants to use for a variety of medical conditions. The monk's purpose was to collect and organize text to make them useful in their monasteries. Medieval monks took many remedies from classical works and adapted them to their own needs as well as local needs. This may be why none of the collections of remedies we have presently agrees fully with another.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt;

Another form of translation was oral transmission; this was used to pass medical knowledge from generation to generation. A common misconception is that one can know early medieval medicine simply by identifying texts, but it is difficult to compose a clear understanding of herbals without prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt; There are many factors that played in influenced in the translation of these herbals, the act of writing or illustrating was just a small piece of the puzzle, these remedies stems from many previous translations the incorporated knowledge from a variety of influences.

==Early modern era==
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
The 16th and 17th centuries were the great age of [[herbal]]s, many of them available for the first time in English and other languages rather than Latin or Greek. The 18th and 19th centuries saw more incorporation of plants found in the Americas, but also the advance of modern medicine.

===16th century===

The first herbal to be published in English was the anonymous ''[[Grete Herball]]'' of 1526. The two best-known herbals in English were ''The Herball or General History of Plants'' (1597) by [[John Gerard]] and ''The English Physician Enlarged'' (1653) by [[Nicholas Culpeper]]. Gerard’s text was basically a pirated translation of a book by the Belgian herbalist [[Rembert Dodoens|Dodoens]] and his illustrations came from a German botanical work. The original edition contained many errors due to faulty matching of the two parts. Culpepper’s blend of traditional medicine with astrology, magic, and folklore was ridiculed by the physicians of his day, yet his book - like Gerard’s and other herbals - enjoyed phenomenal popularity.  The [[Age of Exploration]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]] introduced new medicinal plants to Europe. The ''Badianus Manuscript'' was an illustrated [[Mexico|Mexican]] herbal written in [[Nahuatl]] and [[Latin]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gimmel Millie | year = 2008 | title = Reading Medicine In The Codex De La Cruz Badiano | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1353/jhi.2008.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===

The [[2nd millennium|second millennium]], however, also saw the beginning of a slow erosion of the pre-eminent position held by plants as sources of therapeutic effects. This began with the [[Black Death]], which the then dominant Four Element medical system proved powerless to stop. A century later, [[Paracelsus]] introduced the use of active chemical [[drug]]s (like [[arsenic]], [[copper sulfate]], [[iron]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulfur]]).

===18th century===

In the Americas, herbals were relied upon for most medical knowledge with physicians being few and far between. These books included almanacs, Dodoens' ''New Herbal, Edinburgh New Dispensatory,'' Buchan's ''Domestic Medicine,'' and other works.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal Medicine: The Medical Botany of John Bartram|url = http://www.healthy.net/Health/Article/The_Medical_Botany_of_John_Bartram/861|website = www.healthy.net|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from European knowledge on American plants, Native Americans shared some of their knowledge with colonists, but most of these records were not written and compiled until the 19th century. [[John Bartram]] was a botanist that studied the remedies that Native Americans would share and often included bits of knowledge of these plants in printed almanacs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===19th century===

The formalization of [[pharmacology]] in the 19th century led to greater understanding of the specific actions drugs have on the body. At that time, Samuel Thompson was an uneducated but well respected herbalist who influenced professional opinions so much that Doctors and Herbalists would refer to themselves as Thompsonians. They distinguished themselves from "regular" doctors of the time who used calomel and bloodletting, and led to a brief renewal of the empirical method in herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of herbology, herbalism {{!}} RMHI|url = http://www.rmhiherbal.org/aa/f-ahr1-hist.html#renaiss|website = www.rmhiherbal.org|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US|first = Roger W. Wicke,|last = Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
Traditional herbalism has been regarded as a method of alternative medicine in the United States since the [[Flexner Report]] of 1910 led to the closing of the [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic medical schools]] where botanical medicine was exclusively practiced. In China, [[Mao Zedong]] reintroduced [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine]], which relied heavily on herbalism, into the health care system in 1949. Since then, schools have been training thousands of practitioners – including Americans – in the basics of Chinese medicines to be used in hospitals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; "The Chinese pharmacopeia is 5000 years old and contains substances that are transformed into effective but non-toxic medicines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Films On Demand - Login|url = http://digital.films.com/PortalViewVideo.aspx?xtid=35707|website = digital.films.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Britain in the 1930s was experiencing turbulence over the practice of herbalism, in the United States, government regulation began to prohibit the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The vicissitudes of herbalism in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Britain.|journal = Medical History|date = 1985-01-01|issn = 0025-7273|pmc = 1139482|pmid = 3883085|pages = 71–92|volume = 29|issue = 1|first = P S|last = Brown|doi=10.1017/s0025727300043751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The World Health Organization estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary health care. In Germany, about 600 to 700 plant based medicines are available and are prescribed by some 70% of German physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal medicine|url = https://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/herbal-medicine|website = University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African doctors use herbs to treat many patients, some patients finding the plants more useful than modern medicine previously prescribed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Films On Demand - Login|url = http://digital.films.com/PortalViewVideo.aspx?xtid=53563|website = digital.films.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of prescribing treatments and cures to patients requires a legal medical license in the United States of America, and the licensing of these professions occurs on a state level. "There is currently no licensing or certification for herbalists in any state that precludes the rights of anyone to use, dispense, or recommend herbs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Legal and Regulatory FAQs|url = http://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/legal-and-regulatory-faqs|website = American Herbalists Guild|accessdate = 2015-12-01|first = Mimi|last = Hernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Traditional medicine is a complex network of interaction of both ideas and practices, the study of which requires a multidisciplinary approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal Medicine in Yemen : Traditional Knowledge and Practice, and Their Value for Today's World|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDgwODEyX19BTg2?sid=86371e57-605e-4582-98a5-6e37a26959a9@sessionmgr115&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = web.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many alternative physicians in the 21st century incorporate herbalism in traditional medicine due to the diverse abilities plants have and their low number of side effects.

A high quality physical education programs consists of these attributes:&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201493/|title=Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment|last=|first=|date=2013|website=National Academy of Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical education teachers are certified
* Students in elementary school have physical education class for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, while students in high school have it for at least 225 minutes per week
* Concrete and achievable standards for students to meet (often for high school graduation)

==Causes==
The causes of lack of physical education vary from country to country.  These include a shortage in facilities and [[Sports equipment|equipment]], a paucity of [[Gym teacher|physical education teachers]], large [[Student–teacher ratio|class sizes]], and budgetary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African countries such as [[Botswana]] and [[Malawi]], where children attend school for a minimal amount of time, the budgets allocated for physical education are instead used to concentrate on subjects such as [[language]]s and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lack of physical education also arises from cultural views: in parts of [[Central America]] (such as the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]) and [[Asia]] (such as [[Pakistan]]), exercise is seen as a form of leisure that should not be featured in an academic [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example exists in [[India]], where girls are often discouraged from engaging in [[sport]]s because such activity is viewed as "unfeminine", as is the possibility of them becoming too muscular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a lack of governmental [[legislation]] and intervention can be to blame. In parts of [[South America]] (with the exception of [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]), there are no laws that make physical education compulsory: thus, it is omitted from many schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, such as in areas of the [[United States]], the mandated physical education hours are simply not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/education/even-as-schools-battle-obesity-physical-education-is-sidelined.html|title=Even as Obesity Concerns Rise, Physical Education Is Sidelined|last=Baker|first=Al|date=2012-07-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 33 states, students are permitted to be exempt from physical education courses by replacing them with other activities such as marching band practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/2012-shape-of-the-nation-_n_2130115.html|title=Physical Education Programs Stalled By State Loopholes: 2012 Shape Of The Nation Report|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of school, children often fail to engage in physical activity due to lack of [[physical literacy]], inadequate [[Sleep deprivation|sleep]], the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as [[video game]]s, and parents that do not play their part. It is important that parents allow their children the full opportunity to participate in both formal and informal sports and promote healthy physical activity levels. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in [[China]], there is an increased emphasis on [[Test (assessment)|academic results]] which also detracts from physical activity time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/05/30/lack_of_physical_education_weighs_heavily_on_many/ |title=Lack of physical education weighs heavily on many |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Lisa Wangsness |author2= April Simpson |date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterioration of physical education in schools combined with the elimination of playgrounds and other play facilities forces children to stay inactive and inside for most of the school day which can have serious long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiler|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Is the Lack of Physical Activity Strategy for Children Complicit Mass Child Neglect?|url=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Medical complications of obesity.png|thumb|Physical consequences of obesity]]
An increase in [[sedentary lifestyle]] due to a lack of physical education at home and at school has many physical and psychological consequences on a child in the short and long term.

=== Physical ===
According to a Portuguese study, children with sedentary lifestyles have nine times poorer [[motor coordination]] than active children of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Luís|last2=Santos|first2=Rute|last3=Pereira|first3=Beatriz|last4=Lopes|first4=Vítor Pires|date=2012-11-01|title=Associations between sedentary behavior and motor coordination in children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22310/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=746–752|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22310|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have worsened [[bone density]], [[Physical strength|strength]], and [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, they are more likely to use [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[drug]]s than their active peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Health Canada and the Public health Agency of|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedentary behaviour is strongly associated with [[obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2011001/article/11397-eng.htm|title=Physical activity of Canadian children and youth: Accelerometer results from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this imparts a great health risk. Obese children are more likely to have [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], high [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[sleep apnea]], [[menstrual cycle]] abnormalities, [[bone]] and [[joint]] problems, increased [[cancer]] risk, and reduced balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/surgery/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery/adolescent-weight-loss/Pages/health-risks.aspx|title=Health Risks of Childhood Obesity - Bariatric and Metabolic Institute {{!}} UC San Diego Health|website=UC Health - UC San Diego|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also more likely to be obese adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood physical inactivity has been correlated to cholesterol and fatty streaks in the aorta in the first decade of life and moves to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body in the second and third decade of life, causing health issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other physical health issues among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guedes|first=Claudia|date=2007|title=Physical Education and Physical Activity: A Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|volume=78|pages=31-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a direct correlation between active participation in physical activity and the health of school age children, therefore a lack of physical education would cause a lack in physical activity in children, leading to worse health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
As exercise is known to improve well-being and reduce [[Stress (biology)|stress]], physical inactivity is correlated with poor psychological health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Donna L|year=1996|title=Cut-backs to physical education consulting services: consequences and concerns.|url=|journal=CAHPER Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an increase of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win|first=Sithu|last2=Parakh|first2=Kapil|last3=Eze-Nliam|first3=Chete M.|last4=Gottdiener|first4=John S.|last5=Kop|first5=Willem J.|last6=Ziegelstein|first6=Roy C.|date=2011-03-15|title=Depressive symptoms, physical inactivity and risk of cardiovascular mortality in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/97/6/500|journal=Heart|language=en|volume=97|issue=6|pages=500–505|doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.209767|issn=1468-201X|pmc=3044493|pmid=21339320}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a link between obesity and psychiatric illness and the two feed on each other in a vicious cycle.

A lack of physical activity is associated with poorer [[Concentration (psychology)|concentration]] and [[Academic achievement|academic performance]], particularly in [[mathematics]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201501/|title=Physical Activity, Fitness, and Physical Education: Effects on Academic Performance|last=Harold W.

Obesity induced from lack of exercise also contributes to a decrease in general mental health. Overweight children and teens are more likely to suffer from poor [[self-esteem]], negative [[body image]], [[teasing]], and [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of sedentary and lower levels of physical education are linked to worse mental health and lower cognitive function among children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== In Canada ==

=== Current trends ===
The majority of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) do not meet the daily physical activity recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in [[organized sport]] are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack physical literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in [[Human-powered transport|active transportation]], more [[sleep deprivation]], and a poor quality of [[Dieting|diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lifestyle trends have caused youth obesity rates to nearly triple over the past 30 years. In 2013, this consisted of 28% of Canadian children ages 5–19 that were classified as [[overweight]] or [[Obesity|obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|access-date=2016-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

==== Recommendations and Regulations ====
The Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD) has recommended that Canadian schools and [[Board of education|school boards]] take action through specific academic initiatives to ensuring that their physical education [[curriculum]] is effective at encouraging and instilling healthy exercise habits in young Canadians. CAHPERD has suggested that schools focus on checking the quality (adequate facilities, budget and research-verified techniques) and quantity (minimum 30 minutes a day) of a school's physical education courses as well as the professional qualifications of the educators. The consultants should check that classes meet the needs of all students irrespective of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sex]], [[gender]], and [[Agility|ability level]]. The courses should also encourage participation and [[skill]] development, with a healthy balance of [[Competitiveness|competitive]] and noncompetitive activities. Moreover, it is of utmost importance that [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and [[physical education]] be encouraged by the [[teacher]]: they should never be used to [[Punishment|punish]] a student (such as what is seen through the common practice of making children run if they misbehave). Outside of class hours, CAHPERD recommends that schools provide opportunities for [[Intramural sports|intramural]] activities and involve [[parent]]s in the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phecanada.ca/advocacy/advocacy-tools/making-case-physical-education-canada-presentation-kit-leaders|title=Making the Case for Physical Education in Canada: A Presentation Kit for Leaders {{!}} PHE Canada|date=2010-07-23|website=www.phecanada.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan-Canadian Public Health Network first decided to prioritize the issue of childhood obesity in September 2010 by creating the framework ''Curbing Childhood Obesity: An overview of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights.'' In this project, federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health agreed to focus on three goals: increasing the predominance of [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food choices, addressing obesity at an early age, and creating better spaces for children that favour physical activity and [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]]. This has allowed the [[action plan]] ''Towards a Healthier Canada'' to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/framework-cadre/intro-eng.php|title=Curbing Childhood Obesity: An Overview of the FPT Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights - Public Health Agency of Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Public Health Agency of|website=www.phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Physical Activity guidelines for children ages 5 to 17 consist of at least 1 hour of daily physical activity. Their exercise should range in intensity from [[Moderate exercise|moderate]] (inducing light [[perspiration]] and harder [[breathing]]) to vigorous (inducing heavy perspiration and heavy breathing). Examples of moderate exercise include [[Bicycle|bike]] riding and [[playground]] activities, and examples of vigorous exercise include [[running]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming.]] It is recommended that they engage in both vigorous activities and activities strengthening bone and muscles at least three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also recommends that children ages 5 to 17 limit their sedentary activities, such as [[television]] and video games, [[Transport|sedentary transport]], and extensive [[sitting]]. It is advised that children limit their recreational screen time to a maximum of 120 minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Childhood Obesity]] Foundation'', a Canadian initiative, has invented the 5-2-1-0 [[mnemonic]] to remember the national lifestyle recommendations. This consists of 5 [[Serving size|servings]] or more of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] per day, no more than 2 hours of screen time a day, 1 hour of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] or more per day, and 0 [[sugary drink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of ''Towards a Healthier Canada'', many initiatives have been launched to meet the three goals, and they vary from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phn-rsp.ca/thcpr-vcpsre-2015/index-eng.php|title=Towards a Healthier Canada : Compilation of Initiatives|last=|first=|date=|website=towardsahealthiercanada.ca|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are projects made in the name of a framework or jurisdictional approach/governmental department that are either targeted at schools, at a community, or in partnership with other organizations or companies.

== In the United States ==

=== Current Trends ===
Nearly 10 million [[Child|children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the United States ages 6–19 are considered [[overweight]] because the lack of physical education in schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Physical Education in Schools|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children aged 6–11 have also more than doubled in rate of [[obesity]] over the last twenty years. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Leslie Haub|title=Childhood obesity and the lack of physical education programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGNXNAAACAAJ|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual states have set requirements for physical education in their schools, but how physical education is conducted across the country has not been established. Yet, physical education has been a common practice of the K-12 education curriculum in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Thomas|date=2017|title=Studies of Physical Education in the United States Using SOFIT: A Review|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=88|pages=492-502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No Child Left Behind Act has created an environment in which physical education, art and music have been left behind, viewed as "nonessential" courses. Federal funding is more dependent on schools enhancing their math and reading programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=James|date=2012|title=Physical Education's Role in Public Health|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=83|pages=125-135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
One program the United States has adopted to decrease obesity are before-school exercise programs with elementary aged children. One in particular consists of reaching 100 miles before the end of the school year. Each milestone of 25 miles the child will earn a check mark on a tee-shirt. They will then be rewarded at 100 miles with a trophy and an announcement over the school loudspeaker. Walking is supervised by teachers and done around school grounds or inside the school. This is a great way for a child to improve health, concentration, confidence and happiness.

Throughout the past two decades, federal support for physical education in the public health sector has increased dramatically. Since 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded state education agencies to get them to partner with state health departments to promote physical activity and healthy eating in schools among young people. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started the "Let's Move" initiative to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Efforts to engage in schools to fight against childhood obesity were taken within 1 year of establishing the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Budget cuts in the United States have led to less funding and support for physical education because it is not a "core" subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== In China ==

=== Current Trends ===
Even though obesity has increased among most of the population in China, the burden of obesity has shifted onto the lower educated population, likely due to a lack of physical education or health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huijun|date=2013|title=Program and Policy Options for Preventing Obesity in China|url=|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=14|pages=134-140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in China are beginning to gain equal opportunities to physical education and sports to further improve their physical health and strength.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Chiung-Tzu Lucetta|date=2017|title=The History of Sports and Physical Education in China|url=|journal=World Leisure Journal|volume=59|pages=326-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport and physical education in China is extremely influenced by Confucianism which emphasizes collectivism. The values it holds emphasizes self-sacrifice and subordination of one's interests to those of others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2011, The Chinese Ministry of Education has developed standards for physical education in schools. These emphasize enhancing children's health development is the primary goal of physical education in schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Haiyong|date=2014|title=A Review of Scholarly and Research Work in Physical Education in China During the First Decade of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Quest|volume=66|pages=117-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards include: 

* "Standard 1: Physical activity participation—Students participate in physical activities and are able to enjoy exercise and experience success."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 2: Mastery of knowledge, skill, and safe exercise methods—Students learn knowledge about exercise, perform physical skills, understand safe exercise principles, and learn self-defense."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 3: Developing physical health—Students learn and master knowledge and method of maintaining health, develop and sustain healthy posture and bodily shape, develop and maintain physical fitness, and improve adaptive ability in natural environments."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 4: Developing mental health—Students learn to develop mental strength, control emotions, develop ability to collaborate and cooperate, and follow ethical norms of physical activity."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The General Administration of Sport in China has been one of the leading government agencies that promotes the development of physical education and physical health in the elementary and college levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The government has for the most part supported physical education and sport in school, but has often abused it as a political tool which leads to ignoring its importance and the needs of individual students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In European (EU) Countries ==

=== Current Trends ===
In the EU, physical education is a mandatory subject in general education. The time dedicated to physical education varies greatly from country to country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2016|title=Physical Education in EU Schools|url=|journal=Briefing European Parliamentary Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About half of EU countries devote 10% of their school curriculum to physical education. Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia devote 15%, while Ireland only 4%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matejek|first=Črtomir|date=2014|title=Physical Education in Primary Education in EU Countries|url=|journal=Revija za Elementarno Izobraževanje|volume=7|pages=57-165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all EU countries, France devotes the most time to physical education in elementary school, a total of 108 hours, which is only 10% of the total teaching time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary education designers in European countries view physical education as less important than other subjects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Physical inactivity is responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year in the European Union and accounts for economic costs of over €80 billion per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Funding for physical education in EU schools is poor, which has led to poor quality physical education. This lack of funding is reflected in poor quality and lack of equipment at EU schools in respectively 26% and 38% of EU countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2007, the European Parliament's Resolution on the Role of Sport in Education helped parliament conclude that physical education is “the only school subject which seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their overall physical and mental development, as well as imparting important social values such as fairness, self-discipline, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play…” and one of the most important tools for social integration.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardman|first=Ken|date=2008|title=Physical Education in Schools: A Global Perspective|url=|journal=University of Worcester, UK|volume=1|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parliament's Resolution places physical education on the European political agenda, highlighting its importance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The European Physical Education Association recommends daily physical education in elementary grades up to 11 or 12 years of age and 3 hours per week in post-elementary and high school grades.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''New musicology''' is a wide body of [[musicology]] since the 1980s with a focus upon the cultural study, aesthetics, criticism, and hermeneutics of music. It began in part a reaction against the traditional [[Positivism|positivist]] musicology (focused on primary research) of the early 20th century and [[postwar era]].  Many of the procedures of new musicology are now (2016) considered standard, although the name more often refers to the historical turn rather than to any single set of ideas or principles.  Indeed, although it was notably influenced by [[feminism]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], [[postcolonial studies]], and [[critical theory]], new musicology has primarily been characterized by a wide-ranging eclecticism.

==Definitions and history==
New musicology seeks to question the research methods of traditional musicology by displacing [[positivism]], working in partnership with outside [[discipline]]s, including the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], and by questioning accepted musical knowledge. New musicologists seek ways to employ [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], [[feminism]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]] in the study of music. 

In 1980 [[Joseph Kerman]] published the article "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get Out," calling for a change in musicology. He asked for "a new breadth and flexibility in academic music criticism [musicology]"  (Kerman, 1994, 30) that would extend to musical discourse, [[critical theory]] and [[analysis]]. In the words of [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]: "For me...the notion of an intimate relationship between music and society functions not as a distant goal but as a starting point of great immediacy...the goal of which is to articulate something essential about why any particular music is the way it is in particular, that is, to achieve insight into the character of its identity."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Susan McClary suggests that new musicology defines music as "a medium that participates in social formation by influencing the ways we perceive our feelings, our bodies, our desires, our very subjectivities—even if it does so surreptitiously, without most of us knowing how" (Brett, 1994).  For [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], music has meanings "definite enough to support critical interpretations comparable in depth, exactness, and density of connection to interpretations of literary texts and cultural practices" (Kramer, 1990).

New musicology combines cultural studies with the analysis and criticism of music, and it accords more weight to the sociology of musicians and institutions and to non-canonical genres of music, including jazz and popular music, than traditional musicology did. (A similar perspective became common for American ethnomusicologists during the 1950s.) This has caused many musicologists to question previously held views of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and to make assessments based on critical methods "concerned with finding some kind of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] between [musical] analysis and a consideration of social meaning" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 38).

New musicologists question the processes of canonization. Gary Tomlinson suggests that meaning be searched out in a "series of interrelated historical narratives that surround the musical subject" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 123) – a "web of culture" (Tomlinson, 1984). For example, the work of Beethoven has been examined from new perspectives by studying his reception and influence in terms of masculine hegemony, the development of the modern concert, and the politics of his era, among other concerns.  The traditional contrast between Beethoven and Schubert has been revised in the light of these studies, especially with reference to Schubert's possible homosexuality (McClary in Brett, 1994; Kramer 2003; Mathew, 2012).

==Relationship to music sociology==
New musicology is distinct from German [[sociomusicology|music sociology]] in the work of Adorno, [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Bloch]]. Although some new musicologists claim some allegiance to [[Theodor Adorno]], their work has little in common with the wider field of Adorno studies, especially in [[Germany]]. New musicologists frequently exhibit strong resistance to German intellectual traditions, especially in regard to nineteenth-century German music theorists including [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] and [[Eduard Hanslick]], and also the twentieth-century figures [[Heinrich Schenker]] and [[Carl Dahlhaus]].

A fundamental distinction has to do with attitudes towards [[modernism]] and [[popular culture]]. Influential, oft-cited essays such as McClary 1989 and McClary 2006 are highly dismissive of modernist music. German music sociologists tend to be more favorable towards modernism (though by no means uncritically) and severely critical of popular music as inextricably tied to the aesthetics of distraction as demanded by the [[culture industry]]. Metzger describes "a fascistic element" in the music of the Rolling Stones. New musicology, on the other hand, often overlaps with [[postmodern]] aesthetics; various new musicologists are highly sympathetic towards musical [[minimalism]] (see McClary 1990 and 2000 and Fink 2005).

==Criticisms of new musicology==
[[Vincent Duckles]] writes, "As musicology has grown more [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]], its practitioners have increasingly adopted methods and theories deemed by observers to mark the academy as irrelevant, out of touch with 'mainstream values', unwelcoming of [[Western canon]]ic traditions or simply incomprehensible. Paradoxically, such approaches have distanced music scholarship from a broad public at the very moment they have encouraged scholars to scrutinize the popular musics that form the backbone of modern mass musical culture."

Critics of new musicology include [[Pieter van den Toorn]] and to a lesser extent [[Charles Rosen]]. In response to an early essay of McClary (McClary 1987), Rosen says that "she sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance. (I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)" (Rosen 2000).  For David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, however, writing at two later moments (2005, 2016), the methods of new musicology have been fully incorporated into mainstream musicological practice.

[[File:NouveauRealsime1960.jpg|thumb|The ''Nouveau Réalisme Manifesto'', signed by all of the original members in Yves Klein's apartment, 27 October 1960]]

'''Nouveau réalisme''' ('''new realism''') refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painter [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in [[Milan]].  Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American [[pop art]], and often conceived as its transposition in France, new realism was, along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups, one of the numerous tendencies of the [[avant-garde]] in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the [[French Riviera]], as its home base since [[Yves Klein|Klein]] and [[Arman]] both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hains-TravailleursCommunistes.jpg|thumb|left|''Travailleurs Communistes'' by Raymond Hains]]
The term "new realism" was first used in May 1960 by Pierre Restany, to describe the works of Omiros, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé as they exhibited their work in Milan. He had discussed this term before with Yves Klein (who died prematurely in 1962), who preferred the expression "today's realism" (''réalisme d'aujourd'hui'') and criticized the term "New". After the first "Manifesto of New Realism", a second manifesto, titled "40° above [[Dada]]" (''40° au-dessus de Dada'') was written between 17 May and 10 June 1961. [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] (then practicing "shooting paintings") Omiros with his "free space" and [[Gérard Deschamps]] then joined the movement, followed by [[Christo]] in 1963. Klein, however, started to distance himself from the group around 1961, disliking Restany's insistence on a [[Dadaist]] heritage. 

The first exposition of the ''nouveaux réalistes'' took place in November 1960 at the Paris "''Festival d'avant-garde''".  This exposition was followed by others: in May 1961 at the Gallery J. in Paris; ''Premier Festival du Nouveau Réalisme'' in [[Nice, France|Nice]] from July til September 1961 at the Muratore Gallery and the Abbaye de Roseland; ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of contemporary American [[pop art]] and the Nouveau Réalisme movement at the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]] in New York at the end of 1962; and at the Biennale of San Marino in 1963 (which would be the last collective show by the group). The movement had difficulty maintaining a cohesive program after the death of Yves Klein in June, 1962 and when Omiros abandonned it and decided to go in his own path experimenting with perspective and space.

==Ideas and techniques==
The members of the '''nouveaux réalistes''' group tended to see the world as an image from which they could take parts and incorporate them into their works—as they sought to bring life and art closer together. They declared that they had come together on the basis of a new and real awareness of their "collective singularity", meaning that they were together in spite of, or perhaps because of, their differences. But for all the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Pierre Restany, to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the nouveaux réalistes advocated a return to "reality" in opposition to the lyricism of [[abstract painting]]. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either [[petty-bourgeois]] or as Stalinist [[socialist realism]]. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the ''[[décollage]]'' technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.

Nouveau réalistes made extensive use of [[collage]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], using real objects incorporated directly into the work and acknowledging a debt to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. But the New Realism movement has often been compared to the pop art movement in New York for their use and critique of mass-produced commercial objects ([[Jacques de la Villeglé|Villeglé]]'s ripped cinema posters, [[Arman]]'s collections of detritus and trash), although Nouveau Réalisme maintained closer ties with Dada than with pop art.

==The new realists in architecture==
"The new realists" is also a term applied to a group of Australian architects determined to create a "New Realism" in architecture, based on the understanding of past developments in the discipline of architecture and modern day explorations of new technologies in the fields of design and building technology.

==Analyse critique==
Les artistes reprennent les objets de la société pour en faire des reliques, des symboles puissants de la consommation.

Exemple : Les compressions de César qui mettent en scène des automobiles, le but étant de transformer un objet culte de notre société et d’en faire quelque chose d'autre, à travers ses formes géométriques, l’œuvre sent la conception par l’intermédiaire d’une machine, c’est la disparition de l’habileté manuelle qui était à l’époque un facteur important dans la reconnaissance de la valeur d’un artiste.

On constate également la disparition du matériau noble, les nouveaux réalistes n’utilisent plus de bronze, de pierre, mais de la tôle ou du ciment, des matériaux industriels.

:« L’école niçoise veut nous apprendre la beauté du quotidien. Faire du consommateur un producteur d’art. Une fois qu'un être s'est intégré dans cette vision, il est très riche, pour toujours. Ces artistes veulent s'approprier le monde pour vous le donner. A vous de les accueillir ou de les rejeter. »&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, ''Avec le nouveau réalisme, sur l’autre face de l’art'', Nîmes, Éditions Jacqueline Chambrons, 2000, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

===L'objet comme matériau===
L’accumulation d’Arman, est un agglomérat de voitures de marque [[Renault (Groupe)|Renault]], chez qui il est directement allé travailler pour trouver sa matière première.

Son œuvre n’a pas d’utilité particulière mais il veut surtout le mouvement et la couleur, on ne retient plus que les effets plastiques.

Le matériel n’est pas détourné, il est utilisé pour travailler un mouvement et devient matériau.
Une autre manière de transformer un matériel en matériau selon César, c’est sa mousse de polyuréthane, c’est un matériau presque vivant qui échappe au contrôle de l’artiste, la matière se fixe ses propres limites, et l’œuvre devient indépendante du projet plastique.

Gérard Deschamps, lui, assemble des chiffons, des sous-vêtements feminins (ce qui lui vaudra d'être censuré à de nombreuses reprises) ou expose des bâches de signalisation de l'armée américaine, des plaques de blindage, des tôles irisées par la chaleur, des patchworks, des ballons dans des boîtes en plexiglas ou dans des filets, des skateboards, des « pneumostructures » faites de bouées ou de matelas pneumatiques..et des voiles de planches....a voiles.

===L’objet comme rebut===
L’œuvre de Daniel Spoerri rend compte de la société de consommation qui mange, il se sert dans les poubelles de ses voisins, de ses congénères. Il s’agit du détournement d’un moment important de la journée, qui est figé et réinvesti dans l’art. La résine est affichée contre le mur comme une toile.

Il a la volonté de fixer le temps d’un moment sensé être agréable alors que la société veut de plus en plus nous le marchandiser, et nous presser. Le repas n’est plus le moment convivial qu’il était avant, il devient la nouvelle cible des grosses sociétés de consommation, on se retrouve presque dans une succursale d’une enseigne de la restauration rapide alors que l’on est chez soi. Faire vite, faire simple, peu importe que ce soit vraiment bon. Il faut faire vite, se nourrir, manger, boulimiquement, pour se remplir, Spoerri met ici l’accent sur la nécessité d’un retour aux sources, et d’une société de consommation qui influencerait moins de ses codes, et qui submergerait moins de ses produits, la société actuelle.

Renvoyant à l'univers de la [[publicité]] et de la [[société de consommation]], les [[affiche]]s, décollées, superposées, lacérées, inspirent Jacques Villeglé, Raymond Hains et François Dufrêne ainsi que Mimmo Rotella, qui suit un itinéraire parallèle mais distinct.

===Les « Actions-spectacles »===
Il s'agit de ce qu'on appelera plus tard des "performances" où l'œuvre d'art se construit (ou se détruit) devant le public. L'un des exemples les plus connus sont les ''anthropométries'' d'Yves Klein où ce dernier enduit de jeunes femmes dénudées de peinture et leur commande de se rouler sur une toile blanche, crant ainsi la trace visuelle de leurs mouvements.--&gt;

[[Bioacoustics]] refers to the creation and reception of sound waves among biological organisms. Measured sound emissions by plants as well as differential germination rates, growth rates and behavioral modifications in response to sound are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M, Renton M, Duvdevani N, Timmins M, Mancuso S. Out of Sight but Not out of Mind: Alternative Means of Communication in Plants. Moora M, ed. PLoS ONE. 2012;7(5):e37382. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037382.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants detect neighbors by means other than well-established communicative signals including volatile chemicals, light detection, direct contact and root signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Smith H. Phytochromes and light signal perception by plants–an emerging synthesis. Nature. 2000;407:585–591. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karban R, Shiojiri K. Ecol Lett 12: 502–506. (doi; 2009. Self-recognition affects plant communication and defense. 10.1111/j.1461–0248.2009.01313.x) [PubMed]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pare PW, Tumlinson JH. Plant volatiles as a defense against insect herbivores. Plant Physiol. 1999;121:325–331. [PMC free article] [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because sound waves travel efficiently through soil and can be produced with minimal energy expenditure, plants may use sound as a means for interpreting their environment and surroundings. Preliminary evidence supports that plants create sound in root tips when cell walls break.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M (in review) Green symphonies: a call for studies on sound communication in plants. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because plant roots respond only to sound waves at frequencies which match waves emitted by the plants themselves, it is likely that plants can receive and transduce sound vibrations into signals to elicit behavioral modifications  as a form of below ground communication.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"&gt;Gagliano, M., Mancuso, S., &amp; Robert, D. (2012). Towards understanding plant bioacoustics. Trends in Plant Science, 17(6), 323-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buzz pollination]], or sonication, serves as an example of a behavioral response to specific frequencies of vibrations in plants. Some 2000 plants species, including ''Dodecatheon'' and ''Heliamphora'' have evolved buzz pollination in which they release pollen from anthers only when vibrated at a certain frequency created exclusively by bee flight muscles. The vibrations cause pollen granules to gain kinetic energy and escape from pores in the anthers.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, S., &amp; Hurley, J. (1978). A biophysical model for buzz pollination in angiosperms. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 72(4), 639-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants emit audio acoustic emissions between 10–240&amp;nbsp;Hz as well as ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) within 20–300&amp;nbsp;kHz. Evidence for plant mechanosensory abilities are shown when roots are subjected to unidirectional 220&amp;nbsp;Hz sound and subsequently grow in the direction of the vibration source.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt; Using electrograph vibrational detection, structured sound wave emissions were detected along the elongation zone of root tips of corn plants in the form of loud and frequent clicks. When plants are isolated from contact, chemical, and light signal exchange with neighboring plants they are still able to sense their neighbors and detect relatives through alternative mechanisms, among which sound vibrations could play an important role. Furthermore, ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) have been detected in a range of different plants which result from collapsing water columns under high tension.&lt;ref&gt;Laschimke R, Burger M, Vallen H. 2006. Acoustic emission analysis and experiments with physical model systems reveal a peculiar nature of the xylem tension. J Plant Physiol. 163:996–1007 [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; UAE studies show different frequencies of sound emissions based on whether or not drought conditions are present. Whether or not UAE are used by plants as a communication mechanism is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Perks MP, Irvine J, Grace J. 2004. Xylem acoustic signals from mature Pinus sylvestris during an extended drought. Ann Forest Sci. 61:1–8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although the explicit mechanisms through which sound emissions are created and detected in plants are not known, there are theories which shed light on possible mechanisms. Mechanical vibrations caused by charged cell membranes and walls is a leading hypothesis for acoustic emission generation. Myosins and other mechanochemical enzymes which use chemical energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to produce mechanical vibrations in cells may also contribute to sound wave generation in plant cells. These mechanisms may lead to overall nanomechanical oscillations of cytoskeletal components, which can generate both low and high frequency vibrations.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt;

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures. This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of [[Citizens United]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.&lt;ref&gt;Undressing the CEO: Disclosing Private, Material Matters of Public Company Executives, 11 Penn. Journal of Bus. Law 383 (2009), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040940&lt;/ref&gt; Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey.

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity
# collection of solicited personal information
# dealing with unsolicited personal information
# notification of the collection of personal information
# use or disclosure of personal information
# direct marketing
# cross-border disclosure of personal information
# adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
# quality of personal information
# security of personal information
# access to personal information
# correction of personal information

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
&lt;ref&gt;[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;boyd, D., &amp; Hargittai, E. (2010). Facebook

On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radiodrum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~peterd/radiodrum.html |title=Radio Drum |publisher=Ece.uvic.ca |date=1997-06-23 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''radio-baton''' is a [[musical instrument]] played in three-dimensional space using two mallets (snare drum sticks with wires). It was developed at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1980s (and patented),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.ca/patents/US5463388 |title=Patent US5463388 - Computer mouse or keyboard input device utilizing capacitive sensors - Google Patents |publisher=Google.ca |date=1992-04-01 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally to be a three-dimensional [[computer mouse]]. Currently it is used as a musical instrument similar to a [[MIDI controller]] in the sense that it has no inherent sound or effect, but rather produces control signals that can be used to control sound-production (or other effect.) As such, it can be thought of as a general  [[telepresence]] input device.  The radiodrum works in a similar way to the [[theremin]], which uses [[magnetic capacitance]] to locate the position of the drumsticks.  The two mallets act as antennas transmitting on slightly different frequencies and the drum surface acts as a set of antennas. The combination of the antenna signals is used to derive X, Y and Z.

The radiodrum was designed by [[Bob Boie]]. [[Max Mathews]] recognized its musical potential, mainly focusing on a conducting paradigm, and developed several other versions of it.  [[Andrew Schloss]] pioneered its use as a percussion device and further developed its software and hardware. The radiodrum has been used to control visual effects, and even robotic acoustic instruments like the Yamaha Disklavier and [[Trimpin]] instruments.

The latest version (as of 2013) of the radiodrum was developed by Bob Boie and Andrew Schloss. In addition to X, Y and Z, there is an output for the derivative of Z, which is used to detect changes of direction of the mallets, enabling fine control over snare-drum rolls and other nuanced percussive techniques. 
 
In addition to works by Andrew Schloss, the instrument has been used extensively by composer [[David A. Jaffe]], with Schloss as soloist, in works including:

* "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World," a 70-minute seven-movement concerto for radiodrum-controlled Yamaha Disklavier piano and an orchestra of plucked strings and percussion instruments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://davidjaffesite.squarespace.com/writings/a-virtual-piano-concerto.html |title=David A. Jaffe - Writings - A Virtual Piano Concerto |publisher=Davidjaffesite.squarespace.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Racing Against Time," for radiodrum-controlled computer physical models (electronic sound), with two violins, two saxophones and piano
* "The Space Between Us," for radiodrum-controlled Trimpin percussion instruments and eight strings distributed around the concert hall
* "Underground Economy," an Afro-Cuban improvisational work for radiodrum-controlled electronics, violin and piano
Other works include [[Richard Boulanger]]'s "Solemn Song for Evening", using the [[Bohlen-Pierce scale]].

A '''recommender system''' or a '''recommendation system''' (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of [[information filtering system]] that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference"  a user would give to an item.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992403,00.html|title=Facebook, Pandora Lead Rise of Recommendation Engines - TIME|date=27 May 2010|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts,&lt;ref name="expertseer"&gt;H. Chen, A. G. Ororbia II, C. L.

== Overview ==

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways – through [[collaborative filtering]] or through [[content-based filtering]] (also known as the personality-based approach).&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Jafarkarimi; A.T.H. Sim and R. Saadatdoost [http://www.ijiet.org/show-31-222-1.html A Naïve Recommendation Model for Large Databases], International Journal of Information and Education Technology, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative filtering]] approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.&lt;ref name="Recommender2010"&gt;Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, [http://www.prem-melville.com/publications/recommender-systems-eml2010.pdf Recommender Systems], Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Content-based filtering]] approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.&lt;ref name="mooney99"&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=R. J. Mooney  |author2=L. Roy  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1999 |title = Content-based book recommendation using learning for text categorization |conference = In Workshop Recom. Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are often combined (see [[Recommender system#Hybrid recommender systems|Hybrid Recommender Systems]]).

The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two popular music recommender systems – [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].
* Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.
* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a "station" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user "dislikes" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.

Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).

Recommender systems are a useful alternative to [[search algorithm]]s since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.

Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a "digital bookshelf" in 1990 by [[Jussi Karlgren]] at Columbia University,&lt;ref&gt;Karlgren, Jussi. 1990. "An Algebra for Recommendations." Syslab Working Paper 179 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,&lt;ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Collaborative filtering ===
{{Main article|Collaborative filtering}}

One approach to the design of recommender systems that has  wide use is [[collaborative filtering]].&lt;ref name="Breese98"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John S. Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }},&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.

When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].

Examples of explicit data collection include the following:
* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
* Asking a user to search.
* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes.

Examples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:
* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.
* Analyzing item/user viewing times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.
* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.
* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.

The recommender system compares the collected data to similar and dissimilar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the user. Several commercial and non-commercial examples are listed in the article on [[collaborative filtering|collaborative filtering systems]].

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6,266,649.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,266,649&amp;RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&amp;RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include:
* As previously detailed, [[Last.fm]] recommends music based on a comparison of the listening habits of similar users, while [[Readgeek]] compares books ratings for recommendations.
* [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[LinkedIn]], and other social networks use collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections (by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] uses many signals and in-memory computations for recommending to its users whom they should "follow."&lt;ref name="twitterwtf" /&gt;
Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZEI50fmXTh&amp;sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&amp;f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cold start: These systems often require a large amount of existing data on a user in order to make accurate recommendations.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elahi2016"/&gt;
* Scalability: In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.
* Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.

A particular type of collaborative filtering algorithm uses [[matrix factorization (recommender systems)|matrix factorization]], a [[low rank approximation|low-rank matrix approximation]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;I.

Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model based collaborative filtering. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is user-based algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of model-based approaches is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025512002587|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content-based filtering ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Another common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal16Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Peter Brusilovsky]]|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.

To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the 
[[tf–idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).

To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:

1. A model of the user's preference.

2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.

Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems – How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct feedback from a user, usually in the form of a [[like button|like or dislike button]], can be used to assign higher or lower weights on the importance of certain attributes (using [[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]] or other similar techniques).

A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing.

Pandora Radio is an example of a content-based recommender system that plays music with similar characteristics to that of a song provided by the user as an initial seed. There are also a large number of content-based recommender systems aimed at providing movie recommendations, a few such examples include [[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Jinni (search engine)|Jinni]], [[Rovi Corporation]], and [[Jaman]]. Document related recommender systems aim at providing document recommendations to knowledge workers. Public health professionals have been studying recommender systems to personalize health education and preventative strategies.&lt;ref name="pmid27318270"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Macedo AA, Pollettini JT, Baranauskas JA, Chaves JC| title=A Health Surveillance Software Framework to deliver information on preventive healthcare strategies. | journal=J Biomed Inform | year= 2016 | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages= 159–70 | pmid=27318270 | doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2016.06.002 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=27318270  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19745443"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fernandez-Luque L, Karlsen R, Vognild LK| title=Challenges and opportunities of using recommender systems for personalized health education. | journal=Stud Health Technol Inform | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue=  | pages= 903–7 | pmid=19745443 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19745443  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid recommender systems ===

Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]] and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see&lt;ref name="Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems" /&gt; for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrate that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate
recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.

[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1145/2843948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).

A variety of techniques have been proposed as the basis for recommender systems: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, and demographic techniques. Each of these techniques has known shortcomings, such as the well known [[Cold start (computing)|cold-start]] problem for collaborative and content-based systems (what to do with new users with few ratings) and the knowledge engineering bottleneck&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web – Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches. A hybrid recommender system is one that combines multiple techniques together to achieve some synergy between them.

*[[Collaborative filtering|Collaborative]]: The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. Collaborative systems locate peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. The user-based and the item based nearest neighbor algorithms can be combined to deal with the cold start problem and improve recommendation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Recommender Systems:An Introduction |author1 = Dietmar Jannach |author2 = Markus Zanker |author3 = Alexander Felfernig |author4 = Gerhard Friedrich |year = 2010 |url = http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831032309/http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2015-08-31 |publisher = CUP |isbn = 978-0-521-49336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Content-based: The system generates recommendations from two sources: the features associated with products and the ratings that a user has given them. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.
*Demographic: A demographic recommender provides recommendations based on a demographic profile of the user. Recommended products can be produced for different demographic niches, by combining the ratings of users in those niches.
*[[Knowledge base|Knowledge-based]]: A [[knowledge-based recommender system|knowledge-based recommender]] suggests products based on inferences about a user’s needs and preferences. This knowledge will sometimes contain explicit functional knowledge about how certain product features meet user needs.&lt;ref name=hybrids&gt;Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems], pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constraintbased"&gt;Alexander Felfernig and Robin Burke. [http://www.ist.tugraz.at/felfernig/images/constraint_based_recommendation.pdf Constraint-based Recommender Systems: Technologies and Research Issues], Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Electronic Commerce (ICEC'08), Innsbruck, Austria, Aug. 19-22, pp. 17-26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hybrid recommender system is used here to describe any recommender system that combines multiple recommendation techniques together to produce its output. There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized, for example, two different content-based recommenders could work together, and a number of projects have investigated this type of hybrid: NewsDude,
which uses both naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifiers in its news recommendations is just one example.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

Seven hybridization techniques:
*Weighted: The score of different recommendation components are combined numerically.
*Switching: The system chooses among recommendation components and applies the selected one.
*Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.
*Feature Combination: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.
*Feature Augmentation: One recommendation technique is used to compute a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.
*Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.
*Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

== Beyond accuracy ==
Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important.

*'''Diversity''' – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists.&lt;ref name="Ziegler2005"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ziegler, C.N., McNee, S.M., Konstan, J.A. and Lausen, G.| chapter=Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification| title=Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web| year=2005| pages=22–32|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recommender persistence''' – In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations,&lt;ref name="Beel2013e"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Marcel Genzmehr |author4=Andreas Nürnberger | chapter=Persistence in Recommender Systems: Giving the Same Recommendations to the Same Users Multiple Times| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| volume=8092| pages=390–394| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | series=Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS)| url=http://docear.org/papers/persistence_in_recommender_systems_--_giving_the_same_recommendations_to_the_same_users_multiple_times.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or let users re-rate items,&lt;ref name="Cosley2003"&gt;{{cite book| author=Cosley, D., Lam, S.K., Albert, I., Konstan, J.A., Riedl, {J}.| chapter=Is seeing believing?: how recommender system interfaces affect users' opinions| title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems| year=2003| pages=585–592| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.
*'''Privacy''' – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns&lt;ref name="Pu2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={P}u, {P}., {C}hen, {L}., {H}u, {R}.| title=Evaluating recommender systems from the user's perspective: survey of the state of the art| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–39| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of [[information privacy|data privacy]], and every attempt to introduce any level of user [[Profiling (information science)|profiling]] can result in a negative customer response. A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the [[Netflix Prize]] competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 Rise of the Netflix Hackers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit/|title=Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims|date=17 December 2009|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in part to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.&lt;ref name="nfcancel"/&gt; Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.&lt;ref name="privacyoverview"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naren Ramakrishnan |author2=Benjamin J.

Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.

== Mobile recommender systems ==
{{see|Location based recommendation}}
One growing area of research in the area of recommender systems is mobile recommender systems. With the increasing ubiquity of internet-accessing [[smart phones]], it is now possible to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with (it is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Yong Ge |author2=Hui Xiong |author3=Alexander Tuzhilin |author4=Keli Xiao |author5=Marco Gruteser |author6=Michael J. Pazzani |year = 2010 |title = An Energy-Efficient Mobile Recommender System |conference = Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |url = http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/papers/KDD10.pdf |publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |location = [[New York City|New York City, New York]] |pages = 899–908 |accessdate = 2011-11-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available).

One example of a mobile recommender system is one that offers potentially profitable driving routes for taxi drivers in a city.&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"/&gt; This system takes input data in the form of GPS traces of the routes that taxi drivers took while working, which include location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits. This type of system is obviously location-dependent, and since it must operate on a handheld or embedded device, the computation and energy requirements must remain low.

Another example of mobile recommendation is what (Bouneffouf et al., 2012) developed for professional users. Using GPS traces of the user and his agenda, it suggests suitable information depending on his situation and interests. The system uses machine learning
techniques and reasoning processes in order to dynamically adapt the mobile recommender system to the evolution of the user’s interest. The author called his algorithm hybrid-ε-greedy.&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Bouneffouf |first=Djallel |contribution=Following the User's Interests in Mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems: The Hybrid-e-greedy Algorithm |pages=657–662 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |title=Proceedings of the 2012 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops |year=2012 |url=http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/~bounef_d/index_fichiers/Hybrid-e-greedy%20for%20Mobile%20Context-aware%20Recommender%20System.pdf |isbn=978-0-7695-4652-0 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the "Web of Data" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM&lt;ref name="Ruotsalo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu Mäkelä |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyvönen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657–662 | publisher = Elsevier| year = 2013 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826813000061 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning
techniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.

There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pimenidis |first1=Elias |last2=Polatidis |first2=Nikolaos |last3=Mouratidis |first3=Haralambos |title=Mobile recommender systems: Identifying the major concepts |journal=Journal of Information Science |date=3 August 2018 |pages=016555151879221 |doi=10.1177/0165551518792213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk-aware recommender systems ==
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information and do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user in specific situation. However, in many applications, such as recommending personalized content, it is also important to consider the risk of upsetting the user so as not to push recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process.

===Risk definition===
"The risk in recommender systems is the possibility to disturb or to upset the user
which leads to a bad answer of the user".&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"&gt;{{citation | type=Ph.D.
 | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System
 | publisher = Institut National des Télécommunications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these challenges, the authors in ''DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System''&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"/&gt; have developed a dynamic risk sensitive recommendation system called DRARS (Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System), which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm. They have shown that DRARS improves the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy, the currently available best algorithm, by calculating the most optimal exploration value to maintain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation based on the risk level of the current user's situation. The authors conducted experiments in an industrial context with real data and real users and have shown that taking into account the risk level of users' situations significantly increased the performance of the recommender systems.

== The Netflix Prize ==
{{Main article|Netflix Prize}}

One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/ProgressPrize2007_KorBell.pdf |author1=R. Bell |author2=Y. Koren |author3=C. Volinsky |title = The BellKor solution to the Netflix Prize |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. ''Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.''  Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded [[Gravity R&amp;D]], a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodoky|first1=Thomas|title=Mátrixfaktorizáció one million dollars|url=http://index.hu/tech/net/2009/08/07/matrixfaktorizacio_egymillio_dollarert/|website=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project–derived solution for ecommerce websites.

A second contest was planned, but was ultimately canceled in response to an ongoing lawsuit and concerns from the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="nfcancel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/this-is-neil-hunt-chief-product-officer.html | title = Netflix Prize Update | date = 2010-03-12 | publisher = Netflix Prize Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance measures ==
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. The commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Recently, diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: Temporal diversity in recommender systems. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210–217. ACM, New York&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.&lt;ref name="Turpin2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225–231|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=Nürnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532511|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7–14|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude "we would suggest treating results of offline evaluations [i.e. classic performance measures] with skepticism".

== Multi-criteria recommender systems ==
Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion values, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5751215&amp;tag=1 |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64–76 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; See this chapter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an extended introduction.

== Opinion-based recommender systems ==
In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated text are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and the user’s evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as user’s rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]] and [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]).

== Recommender system evaluation ==
To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; User studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge, which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25–37|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/383952.383992|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=225–231|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=1581133316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153–168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.&lt;ref name="BasaranNtoutsi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|title=Redundancies in Data and their Effect on the Evaluation of Recommendation Systems: A Case Study on the Amazon Reviews Datasets|year=2017|pages=390–398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility in recommender system research ==
In recent years there was a growing understanding in the community that  lots of previous research had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticize that "it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,” and that evaluations are “not handled consistently".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekstrand|first=Michael D.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Michael|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph A.|last4=Riedl|first4=John T.|date=2011-01-01|title=Rethinking the Recommender Research Ecosystem: Reproducibility, Openness, and LensKit|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2043932.2043958|journal=Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=133–140|doi=10.1145/2043932.2043958|isbn=9781450306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that "the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge […] often because the research lacks the […] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konstan|first=Joseph A.|last2=Adomavicius|first2=Gediminas|date=2013-01-01|title=Toward Identification and Adoption of Best Practices in Algorithmic Recommender Systems Research|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532513|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=23–28|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532513|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, lots of research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Breitinger|first1=Corinna|last2=Langer|first2=Stefan|last3=Lommatzsch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gipp|first4=Bela|date=2016-03-12|title=Towards reproducibility in recommender-systems research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|issn=0924-1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said &amp; Bellogín conducted a study of recent papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Said|first=Alan|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|date=2014-10-01|title=Comparative recommender system evaluation: benchmarking recommendation frameworks

They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research."

While reproducibility has not been considered for a long time in the recommender-system community, this aspects is much more considered recently, with several workshops and conferences focusing on reproducibility in recommender system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamopoulos|first=Panagiotis|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|last3=Castells|first3=Pablo|last4=Cremonesi|first4=Paolo|last5=Steck|first5=Harald|date=2014-01-01|title=REDD 2014 – International Workshop on Recommender Systems Evaluation: Dimensions and Design|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2645710.2645780|journal=Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=393–394|doi=10.1145/2645710.2645780|isbn=9781450326681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anticipatory design ==
Anticipatory design is the combination of Internet of Things, User experience design and machine learning. Anticipatory design differs from conventional design, in that within anticipatory design the goal is to simplify the process and minimize difficulty by making decisions on behalf of the users. Examples of services that use various levels of anticipatory designs are: Amazon and Netflix production recommendation which recommend products based on previous behavior, the mobile application Peapod which uses a recommendation engine to allow users to fill their shopping basket based on previous orders, and the Nest thermostat which predicts the perfect room temperature based on user input and time of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/anticipatory-design/|title=What You Need To Know About Anticipatory Design|date=2015-09-10|work=Smashing Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europe20000ya.png|thumb|European [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia]], 20 [[Year#Abbreviations yr and ya|kya]].]]

In biology, a '''refugium''' (plural: ''refugia'') is a location which supports an isolated or [[relict (biology)|relict]] [[population]] of a once more widespread species. This isolation ([[allopatry]]) can be due to climatic changes, geography, or human activities such as [[deforestation]] and overhunting.

Present examples of refuge species are the [[mountain gorilla]], isolated to specific mountains in central Africa, and the [[Australian sea lion]], isolated to specific breeding beaches along the south-west coast of Australia, due to humans taking so many of their number as game.  This resulting isolation, in many cases, can be seen as only a temporary state; however, some refugia may be longstanding, thereby having many [[endemic species]], not found elsewhere, which survive as relict populations. The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool has been proposed to be a longstanding refugium, based on the discovery of the "living fossil" of a marine [[dinoflagellate]] called ''Dapsilidinium pastielsii'', currently found in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mertens | first1=K.N. | last2=Takano | first2=Y. | last3=Head | first3=M.J. | last4=Matsuoka | first4=K. | year=2014 | title=Living fossils in the Indo-Pacific warm pool: A refuge for thermophilic dinoflagellates during glaciations | doi=10.1130/G35456.1 | journal=Geology | volume= 42| issue=| pages= 531–534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], ''refugia'' often refers specifically to [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia]], where some ancestral human populations may have been forced back to [[Glacial refugium|glacial refugia]], similar small isolated pockets in the face of the continental [[ice sheet]]s during the [[Last glacial maximum|last glacial period]]. Going from west to east, suggested examples include the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]] (in northern [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]), the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Balkan]] peninsulas, the [[Ukrainian LGM refuge]], and the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived the glacial maxima (incl. the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]) in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense [[forest cover]].&lt;ref name=Gavashelishvili23&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gavashelishvili, A. |author2=Tarkhnishvili, D. |year=2016 |title= Biomes and human distribution during the last ice age |journal= Global Ecology and Biogeography |doi=10.1111/geb.12437 |volume=25 |pages=563–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Refugia.png|thumb|250px|Proposed Amazonian refugia and modern distribution of the ''[[Selenidera]]'' toucanets. From Haffer, 1969]] --&gt;

As an example of a locale refugia study, [[Jürgen Haffer]] first proposed the concept of refugia to explain the [[biological diversity]] of bird populations in the [[Amazonian river basin]]. Haffer suggested that climatic change in the late [[Pleistocene]] led to reduced reservoirs of habitable forests in which populations become allopatric. Over time, that  led to [[speciation]]: populations of the same species that found themselves in different refugia evolved differently, creating [[parapatric]] [[sister species|sister-species]]. As the Pleistocene ended, the arid conditions gave way to the present humid rainforest environment, reconnecting the refugia.

Scholars have since expanded the idea of this mode of speciation and used it to explain population patterns in other areas of the world, such as [[Africa]], [[Eurasia]], and [[North America]]. Theoretically, current biogeographical patterns can be used to infer past refugia: if several unrelated species follow concurrent [[Range (biology)|range]] patterns, the area may have been a refugium. Moreover, the current distribution of [[species]] with narrow ecological requirements tend to be associated with the spatial position of glacial refugia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01788.x | volume=105 | title=Palaeoclimatic models help to understand current distribution of Caucasian forest species | year=2011 | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | pages=231–248 | last1 = Tarkhnishvili | first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple environment examples of temperature==
One can provide a simple explanation of refugia involving core temperatures and exposure to sunlight. In the [[northern hemisphere]], north-facing sites on hills or mountains, and places at higher elevations count as ''cold sites''. The reverse are sun- or heat-exposed, lower-elevation, south-facing sites: ''hot sites''. (The opposite directions apply in the [[southern hemisphere]].) Each site becomes a refugium, one as a "cold-surviving refugium" and the other as a "hot-surviving refugium". Canyons with deep hidden areas (the opposite of hillsides, mountains, mesas, etc. or other exposed areas) lead to these separate types of refugia.

A concept not often referenced is that of "sweepstakes colonization":&lt;ref name="science-FotP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-Guinea" /&gt; when a dramatic ecological event occurs, for example a meteor strike, and global, multiyear effects occur. The sweepstake-winning species happens to already be living in a fortunate site, and their environment is rendered even more advantageous, as opposed to the "losing" species, which immediately fails to reproduce.&lt;ref name="science-FotP"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5882/1450.abstract | title=Forests of the Past: A Window to Future Changes |author1=Petit, Rémy J |author2=Hu, Feng Sheng |author3=Dick, Christopher W. | journal=Science | year=2008 | volume=320 | issue=5882 | pages=1450–1452 | doi=10.1126/science.1155457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-Guinea"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/guinea_islands/ | title=Gulf of Guinea Islands Biodiversity Project | publisher=California Academy of Sciences | date=10 April 2001 | accessdate=26 April 2016 |author1=Penny, Norman D |author2=Penny, Fabio R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="891">'''Primary cremation'''  and '''secondary cremation''' are terms in [[archaeology]] for describing [[burial]]s of  [[Cremation|cremated]] bodies.

Primary cremation refers to burials where the body is burned "on the spot", in the grave. A secondary cremation is the burning of the body in one spot and then burying the remains and [[grave good]]s elsewhere. Secondary cremation may also more specifically refer to a cremation where the body is burned on a [[pyre]], after which the bones are collected from the ashes and buried elsewhere (Sprague 2005:138). A famous account of such a burial is that of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', describing the funeral of [[Patroclus]].

[[Image:Cubic Zirconia Run Opening.jpg|thumb|Cubic zirconia "run" being opened]]
The '''skull crucible''' process was developed at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in [[Moscow]] to manufacture [[cubic zirconia]]. It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia's melting-point being too high for even platinum [[crucible]]s. 

In essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own "crucible" from its cooler outer layers. The term "skull" refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume. [[Zirconium oxide]] powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool. Heating is accomplished by [[radio frequency induction]] using a coil wrapped around the apparatus.  The outside of the device is [[Water jacket|water-cooled]] in order to keep the RF coil from melting and also to cool the outside of the zirconium oxide and thus maintain the shape of the zirconium powder.
 
Since zirconium oxide in its solid state [[Insulator (electrical)|does not conduct]] electricity, a piece of [[zirconium]] metal is placed inside the gob of zirconium oxide. As the zirconium melts it oxidizes and blends with the now molten zirconium oxide, a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], and is heated by RF induction.

When the zirconium oxide is melted on the inside (but not completely, since the outside needs to remain solid) the amplitude of the RF induction coil is gradually reduced and [[crystal]]s form as the material cools. Normally this would form a [[monoclinic crystal system]] of zirconium oxide. 

In order to maintain a [[cubic crystal system]] a stabilizer is added, [[magnesium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]] or [[yttrium oxide]] as well as any material to color the crystal. After the mixture cools the outer shell is broken off and the interior of the gob is then used to manufacture [[gemstone]]s.

Sokolov and his colleagues in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chugunov2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chugunov|first1=Andrey Vladimirovich|title=Социальная информатика: Учебное пособие|date=2012|publisher=НИУ ИТМО|location=Санкт-Петербургский}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society which are dictated by the technology’s stated capabilities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt;  Similarly, the socially [[Determinism|deterministic theory]] represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory as advocated by Williams &amp; Edge (1996)&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; see technology as the product of human social forces.  In contrast, some social informatics methodologies consider the context surrounding technology and the material properties of the technology to be equally important:  the people who will interact with a system, the organizational policies governing work practice, and support resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This contextual inquiry produces "nuanced [[concept]]ual understanding" of systems that can be used to examine issues like access to technology, [[Telecommunication|electronic forms of communication]], and large-scale [[Computer networking|networks]].&lt;ref name="Kling2000a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|title=Learning about information technologies and social change: The contribution of social informatics|journal=The Information Society|date=2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=217–232|doi=10.1080/01972240050133661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in social informatics can be categorized into three orientations.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;  [[Norm (sociology)|Normative]] research focuses on the development of theories based on [[empirical]] analysis that may be used to develop organizational policies and work practices.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; The heart of such analyses lies in socio-technical interaction networks,&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; a framework built around the idea that humans and the technologies they build are "[[Coconstitutionalism|co-constitutive]]", bound together, and that any examination of one must necessarily consider the other. Studies of the analytical orientation develop theory or define methodologies to contribute to theorizing in institutional settings.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;  Critical analysis, like [[Lucy Suchman]]’s examination of articulation work,&lt;ref name="Suchman1994"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Lucy|last1=Suchman|title=Supporting articulation work: Aspects of a feminist practice of office technology production|conference=Proceedings of the 5th IFIP WG9.1 Conference on Women, Work and Computerization|date=1994|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York|pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine technological solutions from non-traditional perspectives in order to influence design and implementation.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;

==Future==
Social informatics is a young intellectual movement and its future is still being defined.  However, because SST theorists such as [[Robin Williams (academic)|Williams]] and Edge suggest that the [[amorphous]] boundaries between humans and technology that emerge in social shaping technology research indicate that technology is not a distinct social endeavor worthy of individual study,&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; indicating that there is a need for social informatics research that bridges the gap between technological and social [[determinism]].  This observation, coupled with the many fields that contribute research, suggest a future in which social informatics theories and concepts settle to form a substrate, an "indispensable analytical foundation"&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; for work in other disciplines.

Relevant topics about future direction of social informatics are discussed in the book by Fichman and Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014" /&gt; Conceptualization of international discourse, including current trends in research and direction of social informatics development is presented in an article by Smutny.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt; This article discusses current possibilities of development of social informatics within the international discourse of various concepts including possible areas for future cooperation. Other topical article by Marcinkowski&lt;ref name="Marcinkowski2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcinkowski|first1=Michael|title=Data, Ideology, and the Developing Critical Program of Social Informatics|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=2016|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1266–1275|doi=10.1002/asi.23483}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents a perspective shift from studying only the effects of the implementation and use of technology to the primary discussion of what are the ideological implications of empirical work in social informatics connected with data analytics approach.

==In education==
Social informatics is also about teaching social issues of computing to computer science students.&lt;ref name="KlingJewett1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|last2=Jewett|first2=Tom|title=The Social Design of Worklife with Computers and Networks: An Open Natural Systems Perspective|journal=Advances in Computers|date=1994|volume=39|pages=239–293|doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60381-2|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/13m1k4jg|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on educational traditions, social informatics is scattered in the curriculum of different disciplines, as well as in [[computer science]], information science, [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] (Europe) and web sociology.&lt;ref name="Kling2007" /&gt; In some instances there might be a lack of understanding of why teaching social issues of computing is important, both by individual lecturers and students, resulting in a view that social informatics is boring and without importance.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per Arne|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2007|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007" /&gt;

Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered &amp; sponsored over a  hundred  moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's  leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana &amp; Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity. Probably this is what it means to be called as the "Pioneers of moot court competitions in India".

==History==
The '''Surana and Surana Moots''' project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtnext.in/News/City/2016/04/23234516/Dont-lose-principles-for-quick-money.vpf&lt;/ref&gt; One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted  Mr. Surana  to plan  a well structured  &amp; transparent moot court competition platform for  law students  to develop skills in oral and  written  advocacy  as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence. Members of the higher &amp; lower judiciary have participated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International moot court competition starts at PU|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/international-moot-court-competition-starts-at-pu/411754/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in these moots  and have greatly  appreciated  the efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moot Court contests conclude|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100906/cth1.htm|publisher=Tribune Chandigarh|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Surana &amp; Surana in developing legal skills among  generations of  budding lawyers.

'''''The Birth of Biopolitics''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1978 and 1979 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] introduced in a previous lecture series, ''Security, Territory, Population'', by tracing the ways in which the eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental [[rationality]]. Foucault uses the term [[Governmentality]] and raising questions of [[Political science]], [[political philosophy]] and [[social policy]] concerning the role and status of the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[neo-liberalism]] in twentieth century politics.

== New rationality ==

For Foucault, [[biopolitics]] is political power exercised on whole populations in every aspect of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 363 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault discusses the basic definition of the practices of the neoliberal art of government. Foucault then tries to redefine the boundaries set by liberal thought on this matter. Foucault concentrates on the monetary aspect of government as a point of concern, frugal government, the art of maximum and a minimum and between the total opposite minimum and maximum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-29 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault looks at the early institutional practices of this method of frugal government, which starts from the early Middle Ages down to the early 16th and 17th centuries. The market appears from the early Middle Ages where the function of interest on money lending was strictly prohibited; one of the reasons being that the church was the main institution lending money at interest on church property where rental income was charged on church property a primary source of income for the church and it would have brought down the price of the church rental income if faced with rival competitors. Justification, according to Foucault, for the market was justice which was why the market existed in the first place. But, what was meant by justice? Foucault offers this explanation; it was a site of justice in the sense that the sale price fixed in the market was seen, both by theorist and in practice, as a just price, or at any rate a price that should be the just price, which meant to the theorists of the day a price that was to have a certain relationship with work performed, with the needs of the merchants, and of course, with the consumers needs and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-53 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The next general theme Foucault introduces is the German [[Ordoliberalism]], the [[Freiburg School]] which produced general problems among themselves, namely the state apparatus and its reconstruction after the Second World War. This general theme led to neo-liberalism heavy reliances on the law obviously, but it too, had to produce a new kind of consensus and a rearrangement consensus between the general populace; the working population, those engaged in production. This general or collective consensus produced 'economic partners' in this so-called 'economic game',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 51-73 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; such as; investors, employers, government officials, work force, and trade union officials. Foucault then offers some explanation on what was the reasoning behind this consensus between all these so-called different economic partners. According to Foucault this produced another kind of consensus, which was political power of the electoral community, not the political power of the right to vote, but the right of the political community to exchange seats, a rearrangement of the very relations of the so-called change of 'government' which gives and protects legitimacy. Which becomes political consensus, inasmuch as the 'economic partners 'accept the economic game of freedom. This is very much on neo-liberalism agenda, which according to Foucault was exactly the agenda that neo-liberalism required.

A strong Deutschmark, a satisfactory rate of economic growth, increased wages, an expanding purchasing power, and a favorable balance of payments which became a by product of the effects of good government. Foucault reads into this that in contemporary German which was in reality a founding consensus of the state. Foucault notices that this formation of a liberal type of governmentality had general shifts within this circle which can be traced back to the 18th century old or classical liberalism programmed by the [[Physiocrats]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], and the other economists, for whom the problem was the exact opposite. The problem that neo-liberalism had to resolve was the following: given the existence of a legitimate state, which is fully functional under the police state with all its administration form of police state, how can this be limited within the existing state and, above all, allow for the necessary economic freedom within it.

For Foucault, this was the exact opposite because after the [[Second World War]], the war machine that was unleashed was due to the fact that the system of economic rationality had broken down and the organisational network of world trade and its accompanied trade settlement system had completely become untenable, in which trust in the final payment settlement system had completely vanished, therefore initiating the military machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The network of world trade : a companion volume to "Europe's trade" |publisher=League of Nations |year=1942 |oclc=2835669 |pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Trade Network |first1=Luca |last1=De Benedicts |first2=Luca |last2=Tajoli |date=2010-09-15 |url=http://www.eief.it/files/2010/10/luca-de-benedictis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy of society ==
Another theme Foucault concentrates on is the neo-liberalism conception of social effects, ''[[Gesellschaftspolitik]]'', known in English, from the German, as the ''policy of society'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-157 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 101-128 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 159-184 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; this policy of society addresses the whole consensus of society. But this ''Gesellschaftspolitik'' had a two sided inconsistency, it had to produce the willing actors who take part in the economic process to accept the reality of their economic position and therefore their fate. The working population or labor force, the ones involved in production, madness, disease, medicine, delinquency, sexuality, but somehow, none of these faults/errors never existed before practices were involved and invented to become part of collective consciousness within practices. Foucault deals with this problem as necessary intrinsic operations of government which inextribably can produce ''regimes of truth'' (Foucault means regimes of truth as necessary social practices which become necessary objects of knowledge).

The ability to extrapolate a collective of co-ordinate errors becoming co-ordinated practices which become something that did not exist in the first place, but now becomes established systems of knowledge objects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-51 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The political regimes of truth (political power upon every aspect of human social life), the battle between legitimacy, submitting to a fabricated division between true and false. Foucault begins to try to trace back through time how this was at all possible, Foucault manages this task by reading into the set of practices interwoven into the policy of society, this was accomplished from the 16th until the 18th century where there was a whole set of practices of tax levies, customs, charges, manufacture regulations, regulations of grain prices, the protection and codification of market practices, etc.

This was well conceived by the exercise of sovereign rights, feudal rights, as the maintenance of customs, as effective procedure of enrichment for the financial administration of the general sovereign or the tax authorities, or as techniques for preventing urban revolt due to the discontent of this or that group of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-150 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault takes a look at these general practices through looking at the economic practices involved from the 18th century (where [[Mercantilism]] was at its peak) where a coherence strategy established an intelligible mechanism which provided a coherent link, together these different practices and their effects, and consequently allows one to judge all these practices as good or bad, not in terms of a law or moral principle, but in terms of propositions subject to the false dichotomy between true and false. Governments, Foucault noticed, were compelled to enter this competitive environment, by doing so entering into new regimes of truth with the fundamental effect of reconfiguring all the questions formally beset by the art of government.

Foucault turns his attention to [[ordoliberalism]]'s view on social policy and how this can be woven into society's political power which differentates from [[Adam Smith]]'s liberalism two centuries earlier. This problem was faced head on by ordoliberalism; how can the overall exercise of political power be modeled on the principles of a market economy? To accomplish this the old version of classic liberalism had to be subjected to a whole series of modifications. The first set of transformations was the dissociation of the market economy from the political principle of [[laissez-faire]], this uncoupling of the market and laissez-faire was replaced with, not abandon by a theory of pure competition which produced a formal structure and formal properties which could lay the fundamental principle of the compective structure that assured economic regulation through the price mechanism. This is a break from traditional liberalism principles.Founded by traditional liberals such as [[Walter Lippmann]] and expressed by many other traditional liberals such as [[Jacques Rueff]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]], [[Alexander Rüstow]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Robert Marjolin]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and their intermediaries and a non-economist, but however, was highly influential, according to Foucault [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp.133-157 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' p.152 see note 12 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

How would neo-liberalism define the new governmental action? Foucault traces three examples which neo-liberalism call a conformable economic action; firstly the question of monopolies which they claimed differed somewhat from classic liberalism. The classic conception of the economy as the monopoly seen as somehow semi-neutral, semi-necessary consequence of the competition in a [[capitalist]] system. The neo-liberal dream of competition cannot be left to develop without monopolistic phenomena appearing at the same time. This would eventually have the effect, of suppressing the operation of mechanism that facilitate, bring with them, and hopefully determine its eventual destiny. However, Foucault notices specific problems began to emerge for neo-liberalism, not only specific to neo-liberalism was how to incorporate civil society, political power; and [[Homo oeconomicus]] into a non-substitutable, irreducible atom of interest. Foucault makes the starting point of his investigations into this process from the 18th century where ''Homo oeconomicus'' has to be integrated into the system of which he is a part.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 215-237 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society ==
The concept ''[[Homo economicus]]'' had specific problems being interwoven into the new-found economic process of the 18th century. Foucault manages to trace this anomaly through the subject of right (known as [[consent of the governed]] the theory of right of that legal theorists of the 18th century tried to establish during their legal discourse) which did receive a great deal of attention because of what was perceived at the time of problems regarding the sovereign's power. The subject of right had to perform slight modifications because of the implication of him (the subject of right) limiting the sovereign's power. Which certainly differed from classical liberalism's conception of the sovereign power, which from the 16th century was conceived of as impenetrable to any rational discourse. The sovereign was conceived of as absolute, but the discovery of the people, subject of rights, homo oeconomicus, changed all that because of the arrival of market practices (the market system of capitalism) from the 18th century. Even the Physiocrats insisted that the market, the sovereign had to really respect the market.

How could this new problematic of liberalism, the sovereign, the market, and the new-found political power, homo oeconomicus which economic activity had at least specific patterns of correlation could be moulded into one tight unit? Foucault seeks the answer to this with a new field of reference, [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 290-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-289 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault answers this question on the process of how to govern through governmental technology, the new neo-liberals, economic liberals sought to have a heterogeneity of the economic and the judicial which must be pegged to an economy understood as process of production and exchange. [[Civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; according to Foucault's analysis, must place particular attention to its correlation of technology of government, the rational measure of which must be judicially pegged to an economy understood as the process of production and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

What made this version of civil society tick? Foucault makes the amalgamation of civil society into society, which at the end of the 18th century became known as the nation (now known to us as the [[nation state]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This became omnipresent, nothing was allowed to escape, which was to conform to the rules of right, and a government which nevertheless respects the specificity of the economy, will be a government that manages civil society, the nation, society, and the social. Foucault continues the theme on Homo oeconomicus which became part and parcel to this feature, ''Homo oeconomicus'' and civil society were two inseparable features and belonged to the same ensemble of the technology of liberal governmentality. For Foucault this was no mere coincidence, since the 19th century, civil society has always been referred to in [[political philosophy]] discourse as a fixed reality, which according to this theory, was outside of government or the state or state apparatuses or institutions. This omnipresent has many characteristics and one its main features are a primary and immediate reality which forms part of modern governmental technology.

Foucault views this governmental characteristic as simply the direct correlation of modern society's direct association with madness, disease, sexuality, criminal recidivism and criminal delinquency which he calls transactional realities. Although civil society, along with its associated governmental technologies haven't always existed they are nonetheless real, by real he simply means the power dynamic and their interplay with the rest of society in which all those involved, everything within it constantly eludes them. It is in Foucault's analysis where he makes four important points on this governmental modern technology of biopolitics; an absolute correlative to the form of governmental technology which liberalism associated itself with, and it is pegged, tied to the specificity of economic process.

How were all three incorporated into rational liberalism philosophical discourse? Foucault cites the well-known texts of [[Adam Ferguson]]: ''Essay on the History of Civil Society''; from the 18th century to show how liberalism approached this problem from different angles and [[Adam Smith]] and his ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' which complement one another with regards civil society. First: there is a political and social correlate in terms of civil society. Second, civil society as principle of spontaneous synthesis; third, civil society as permanent matrix of political power; and fourth, civil society as the motor element that drives human history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Ages of the Interior Life''''' : ''Prelude of Eternal Life'' (Les Trois Ages de la Vie Interieure) is a book written by French theologian [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], published in 1938 and 1939 in two volumes, while teaching at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]], Rome from 1909 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Translator's Preface |title= The Three Ages of the Interior Life, Catholic Spiritual Teaching |url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php#bk2 |accessdate= 2014-07-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The book explains the entire Catholic tradition on the [[Interior life (Catholic theology)|interior life]] as well as [[spirituality|spiritual life]] covering virtually all aspects of the faith. Composed of 95 chapters, it is a synthesis of Garrigou Lagrange's earlier works, ''Christian Perfection and Contemplation'' (''Perfection chrétienne et contemplation'' (1923))  and ''Love of God and the Cross of Jesus'' (''L'amour de Dieu et la Croix de Jésus'' (1929)).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = The Three Ages of the Interior Life: Preface |publisher= Catholic Spiritual Teaching| url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php | accessdate = 2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a classic of modern theological literature.

In the book he propounded the thesis that infused [[contemplation]] and the resulting [[mysticism|mystical]] life are in the normal way of holiness of [[Christian perfection]]. This influenced the section entitled "Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church" in the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprweb.com/2009/04/rehabilitation-of-garrigou-lagrange/|title=Rehabilitation of Garrigou-Lagrange|author=[http://fatherbtm.com/ Mullady, Brian, O.P.]|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25256">The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' ('''TO''')   describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Augusto Boal]] first elaborated in the 1970s, initially in [[Brazil]] and later in [[Europe]]. Boal was influenced by the work of the educator and theorist [[Paulo Freire]]. Boal's techniques use theatre as means of promoting social and political change in alignment originally with [[Far-left politics|radical left]] politics and later with [[center left]] ideology. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the audience becomes active, such that as "spect-actors" they explore, show, analyse and transform the reality in which they are living.

==History==
The Theatre of the Oppressed, a term coined by Augusto Boal, is a series of theatrical analyses and critiques developed in the 1950s. Boal was an avid supporter of utilizing interactive techniques, especially in the context of theatre. Many of his ideas are considered as "a new media perspective", despite the relatively early birth of these ideas. Since then, these ideas have been developed more, giving them meaning in a modern-day context. The creation of the Theatre of the Oppressed is largely based on the idea of dialogue and interaction between audience and performer. Moreover, these ideas have served as a framework for the development and evolution of stronger ideas.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Terminology==

===Joker/facilitator/difficultator===
Much of [[Augusto Boal]]'s theatrical process requires a neutral party to be at the centre of proceedings. This individual is usually called the "facilitator". In Boal's literature this role is referred to as the "joker", in reference to the neutrality of the [[Joker (playing card)|Joker card]] in a deck of playing cards.

This person takes responsibility for the logistics of the process and ensures a fair proceeding, but must never comment upon or intervene in the content of the performance, as that is the province of the "spect-actors". Fairness in this context means making sure that the problem story, which by its nature involves a situation of oppression that must be overcome, is not solved—that is, that the participants (the "{{not a typo|spectactors}}") focus on solving the problem in as realistic and plausible a way as possible, even though it is being played out in a fictional theatrical piece. The result should be something like group "brainstorming" about social problems within the community.

===Spect-actor===
This is a term created by Augusto Boal to describe those engaged in Forum theatre. It refers to the dual role of those involved in the process as both spectator and actor, as they both observe and create dramatic meaning and action in any performance.

Equally, the term "spect-actor" can be attributed to the participants in invisible theatre (who are unaware that they are part of a theatrical production, but nevertheless contribute to the discussion) and image theatre (who, upon viewing the image created, may alter it to reflect their own ideas).

Boal emphasizes the critical need to prevent the isolation of the audience. The term "spectator" brands the participants as less than human; hence, it's necessary to humanize them, to restore to them their capacity for action in all its fullness. They must also be a subject, an actor on equal plane with those accepted as actors, who in turn must also be spectators. This will eliminate any notions of the ruling class and the theatre solely portraying their ideals while the audience members are the passive victims of those images. This way the spectators no longer delegate power to the characters either to think or act in their place. They free themselves; they think and act for themselves. Boal supports the idea that theatre is not revolutionary in itself but is rehearsal of revolution. (Wardrip-Fruin, 352)&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort. "From Theatre of the Oppressed." The NewMediaReader. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}, p. 339-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major branches==

During the development of Theatre of the Oppressed, Boal worked with many populations and tried many techniques. These techniques eventually coalesced into different theatrical styles, each using a different process to achieve a different result. Boal often organized these theatrical systems as a tree, with images, sounds and words as the roots, games, Image Theatre and Forum Theatre ascending up the trunk, and then other techniques represented as limbs stemming from these.&lt;ref name="TO Tree"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theatre of the Oppressed?|url=http://theforumproject.org/whatisto/|work=Tree of the Theatre of the Oppressed|publisher=The Forum Project|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more T.O. systems evolved, Boal and others have made slight modifications to which techniques appear on various limbs, but the Tree of Theatre of the Oppressed has mostly remained consistent:

===Image theatre===
{{main article|Image theatre}}
Image theatre is a performance technique in which one person, acting as a sculptor, moulds one or more people acting as statues, using only touch and resisting the use of words or mirror-image modelling. Boal claims this form of theatre to be one of the most stimulating because of its ease of enactment and its remarkable capacity of portraying thought in a concrete form due to the absence of language idiom. Each word has a denotation common for all as well as a connotation that is unique for each individual. Each will have his own interpretation of "revolution", and to demonstrate such idea provides a clearer understanding of their intention in definition when shown rather than told. (Wardrip-Fruin, 344). For instance, one can "embrace" another in many ways (in a tight, harassing manner or a loose soft manner), however the word has the same definition of clasping another person in the arms.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Forum theatre===
{{main article|Forum theatre}}
[[File:Theatre of the Oppressed1.jpg|thumb|300px| Participants in a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
While practicing in South America earlier in his career, Boal would apply 'simultaneous [[dramaturgy]]'. In this process, the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way (for example, a typically [[chauvinist]] man mistreating a woman or a factory owner mistreating an employee). In early forms of 'simultaneous dramaturgy', the audience could propose any solution, by calling out suggestions to the actors who would improvise the changes on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, Boal (1993). Theater of the Oppressed p. 132-133. New York: Theatre Communications Group. {{ISBN|0-930452-49-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to undo the traditional audience/actor partition and bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching.

Forum Theatre was essentially born from 'simultaneous dramaturgy.' The concept of the 'spect-actor' became a dominant force within and shaped Boal's theater work, gradually helping it shift into what he called Forum Theatre (due to the acting's taking on the character of a public discussion or series of proposals, only in dramatic format). The audience were now encouraged to not only imagine change but to actually practise that change, by coming on stage as 'spect-actors' to replace the protagonist and act out an intervention to "break the oppression." Through this process, the participant is also able to realize and experience the challenges of achieving the improvements he/she suggested (Wardrip-Fruin, 344).&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt; The actors who welcome the spectactor volunteering onto the stage play against the spectactor's attempts to intervene and change the story, offering a strong resistance so that the difficulties in making any change are also acknowledged.

[[File:Augusto Boal nyc2.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Augusto Boal''' presenting a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
Thus, Boal's current manifestation of Forum theatre is as follows: the actors (either professional actors or non professionals drawn from oppressed communities) perform a play with a scripted core, in which an oppression relevant to the audience is played out. After reaching the scripted conclusion, in which the oppressed character(s) fail to overturn their oppression, the actors begin the production again, although often in a condensed form. At any point during this ''second'' performance, any spect-actor may call out "stop!" and take the place of the actor portraying the ''oppressed'' individual (this actor stays on stage but to the side, giving suggestions to the spect-actor who has replaced him/her).

If and when the oppression has been overthrown by the spect-actors, the production changes again: the spect-actors now have the opportunity to replace the ''oppressors'', and find new ways of challenging the oppressed character. In this way a more realistic depiction of the oppression can be made by the audience, who are often victims of the oppression. The whole process is designed to be [[dialectic]], coming to a conclusion through the consideration of opposing arguments, rather than [[Didacticism|didactic]], in which the moral argument is one-sided and pushed from the actors with no chance of reply or counter-argument.

Boal clarifies that this practice is not intended to show the correct path, but rather to discover all possible paths which may be further examined. The theatre itself is not revolutionary; but it offers a chance to rehearse for revolution. The spectators learn much from the enactment even though the acting is fiction, because the fiction simulates real-life situations, problems, and solutions. It stimulates the practice of resistance to oppression in reality, and offers a "safe space" for practicing making change. When faced in reality with a similar situation they've rehearsed in theatre, participants who have experienced Forum Theatre ideally will desire to be proactive, and will have the courage to break oppressive situations in real life, since they feel much more prepared and confident in resolving the conflict. Another way of thinking about it is that rehearsing the actions helps spectactors to develop their own courage and makes them desire action for change in real life. The practice of this form creates an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks fulfillment through real action. (Wardrip-Fruin, 346) &lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Invisible theatre===
{{main article|Invisible theatre}}
Invisible theatre is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one—for example in the street or in a shopping centre. The performers attempt to disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, encouraging the spectators (or rather, unknowing spect-actors) to view it as a real event. The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal &amp; Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during Boal's time in Argentina in the 1970s as part of his Theater of the Oppressed work, which focused on oppression and social issues.

===Newspaper theatre===
A system of techniques devised to give the audience a way to transform daily news articles or any non-dramatic pieces to theatrical scene. The strategies are as follows (Wardrip-Fruin, 346):&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

* ''Simple Reading'': news item read, detached from the context of the newspaper (which makes it false or controversial).
* ''Crossed Reading'': two news item are read in alternating form, complementing or contrasting each other in a new dimension.
* ''Complementary Reading'': information generally omitted by the ruling class are added to the news.
* ''Rhythmical Reading'': article is read to a rhythm (musical), so it acts as a critical "filter" of the news, revealing the true content initially concealed in the newspaper.
* ''Parallel Action'': actors mimic the actions as the news is being read. One hears the news and watches its visual complement.
* ''Improvisation'': news is improvised on stage to exploit all its variants and possibilities.
* ''Historical'': data recurred from historical moments, events in other countries, or in social systems are added to the news.
* ''Reinforcement'': article is read accompanied by songs, slides, or publicity materials.
* ''Concretion of the Abstract'': abstract content in news is made concrete on stage, i.e. hunger, unemployment, etc.
* ''Text out of Context'': news is presented out of context in which it was originally published.

===Rainbow of Desire===
'''Rainbow of Desire''' is a technique and also a family of techniques explained by Boal in his book of the same name. Rainbow techniques stem from Image theatre and tend to focus on forms of internalized oppression played out by a [[protagonist]] in relation to an [[antagonist]]. While in his earlier work Boal eschewed the use of Theatre of the Oppressed as "[[drama therapy]]", he later began to espouse these more introspective techniques as a form of "theatre and therapy."&lt;ref name=ROD&gt;{{cite book|last=Boal|first=Augusto|title=The Rainbow of Desire : the Boal method of theatre and therapy|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-10349-5|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative theatre===
When Boal was a ''Vereador'' ([[Alderman|city councilman]]) in Rio de Janeiro, he created a new form of theatre called "legislative theatre" to give his voters the opportunity to voice their opinions. The objective is to open up a dialogue between citizens and institutional entities so that there is a flow of power between both groups. Boal calls this type of legislative process a "transitive democracy," which lies in between direct democracy (practiced in ancient Greece) and delegate democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://ospiti.peacelink.it/giolli/giolli_gb/node5.html#SECTION02360000000000000000&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to forum theatre; however, the subject of the production is based on a proposed law to be passed. Spect-actors may take the stage and express their opinions, thereby helping with the creation of new laws. Some 13 laws were created through legislative theatre during Boal's time in government. The technique has since been used overseas in countries including [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Other techniques==

===Analytical theatre===
A story is told by one of the participants and immediately the actors improvise it. Afterward each character is broken down into their social roles and the participants are asked to choose a physical object to symbolize each role. For instance for one community the symbol for the head of the family may be a piggy bank, since that individual is the one who controls the finances (power). Having analyzed the characters, a fresh attempt to tell the story is made, however this time removing some of the symbols from each character, and consequently some social roles as well. For example, the story would be perceived differently if the robber had the police uniform and the hostage possessed a revolver. Through this method, the participants will realize that human actions are not the exclusive and primitive result of human psychology; the individual speaks of their class as well. (Wardrip-Fruin, 351)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Breaking repression===
Boal explains that the technique of breaking repression involves asking the participant to remember a particular moment when he or she felt especially repressed, accepted it, and submitted to act in a manner contrary to his or her own desires. It is necessary, he explains, that the choice is a particular incident rather than a general sense of oppression. The participant describes that incident, which is then reconstructed and re-enacted with other participants of his choosing. This performance is repeated, except that this time the repressed is asked to fight to impose his or her will while the others involved are invited to maintain the repression.

The conflict that results helps to measure the possibility one has to resist in situations where one  fails to do so, as well as to measure the true strength of the enemy. Having rehearsed a resistance to oppression prepares the individual to resist effectively in similar situations that may be encountered in the future.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

Boal states that the process to be realized in doing this type of theater is the one that ascends from the phenomenon toward the law; from the phenomena presented in the plot toward the social laws that govern those phenomena.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Photo-romance&lt;!--'Photo-romance' and 'Photoromance' redirect here--&gt;===
{{main|Photo comics}}
'''Photo-romance'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a romantic narrative illustrated with sequential photographs in the style of a comic strip, usually published in magazines and such. The technique involves introducing to the participants the general plot without revealing the source of the photo-romance. Then, the participants are asked to act out the story, which is then compared to the actual story as described in the source. The differences are discussed thereafter.

A particular story interpreted and acted out may be a predictable, pathetic one, however at the same time this result serves as a magnificent example of ideological insight. Boal argues that if they first act out the story themselves then afterwords read the original version, the participants will no longer assume a passive, expectant attitude, but instead a critical, comparative one. They will also be prepared to detect the poison infiltrating the pages of those photo-stories, or the comics and other forms of cultural and ideological domination. This technique is also useful to analyze television programs, a dominant source of poison directed against the people. (Wardrip-Fruin, 349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Rituals and masks===
This technique attempts to reveal the [[Ideology|ideological]] [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of a society in the form of its rituals. "Rituals" in this sense describes the patterns of human relationships and the masks of behaviour that those patterns impose on the participants according to the roles that they play in society. For example: a man goes to a priest to confess his sins; despite the individual identities of the man and priest (i.e. the priest and the parishioner are landlords, the priest is a landlord and the parishioner is a peasant, etc.) the pattern of behavior will remain the same as other examples of this interaction. This will cause different scenarios to play out even though the confession is the same.  Boal argues that this is an extraordinarily rich technique that has many variants: for example, the same ritual may be explored by its participants exchanging masks or it may be enacted by people from different social classes.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Organizations==

===International Theatre of the Oppressed Organisation===
Inspired by Augusto Boal, this Organisation links other Theatre of the Oppressed groups to one another. The idea is that others will help groups organize themselves and create new centers for Theatres of the Oppressed. There are links to other organisations involved with this projects so anyone can contact anyone else involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatreoftheoppressed.org/en/index.php?nodeID=1&lt;/ref&gt; This online Organisation allows others to share information about the Theatre of the Oppressed.

The largest single organisation in the Theatre of the Oppressed network is Jana Sanskriti. Set up by Sanjoy Ganguly in the Sunderbans, a rural area outside Calcutta in the Bay of Bengal, Jana Sanskriti has a membership of over 40,000, 30 theatre teams, and an impressive record of art and activism which has resulted in major improvements in health, infrastructure, welfare benefits, education and social awareness through the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjoy Ganguly, Forum Theatre and Democracy in India, London, Routledge, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Boal's ideas have been widely accepted and used by theatre groups in [[Mozambique]] after the end of the civil war in 1992 to explain the need for reconciliation and to discuss topics such as avoiding landmines, voting in the first democratic elections and the rights of peasants under the new land law.
Grupo de Teatro dos Oprimidos - Maputo was founded in 2001 after Alvim Cossa spent six months studying theater methodology in Rio de Janeiro by a grant from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  It has presented plays such as ''[[O meu marido esta a negar]]'' (My Husband is in Denial), documented as a film by [[Rogério Manjate]], which discusses HIV/AIDS avoidance and treatment. This play is presented in public places - markets, schools and businesses - and the public is invited to attend and present their own solutions to the unequal power relations shown in the play. The result is more effective than a lecture in Portuguese or distribution of written material to a largely illiterate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Centre for Community Dialogue and Change===
[http://www.ccdc.in Centre for Community Dialogue and Change] (CCDC) is an organisation based in Bengaluru, India which is dedicated to the promotion of Theatre of the Oppressed chiefly in education as well as medical humanities. CCDC has conducted many workshops among diverse population in India as well as abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Community Dialogue and Change|url=http://www.ccdc.in/|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical Humanities Group, UCMS===
[[Infinite Ability]], the disability special-interest-group within the Medical Humanities Group of [[University College of Medical Sciences]] (UCMS), Delhi, India and CCDC organised the first ever Theatre of the Oppressed workshop for medical students in Delhi in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability.|journal=Medical education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|pages=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed. in 1598|url=http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2012/54/3/296/102461|publisher=Indian J Psychiatry|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these groups are promoting theatre of the oppressed in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pandya|first1=SK|title=Letter from Mumbai.

In art, theme is usually about [[life]], [[society]] or [[human nature]], but can be any other subject. Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work. Themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated. Deep thematic content is not required in a work, but the great majority of works have some kind of thematic content, not always [[Authorial intentionality|intended by the author]]. Analysis of changes (or implied change) in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme.

A theme is not the same as the subject of a work. For example, the ''subject'' of ''[[Star Wars]]'' is "the battle for control of the galaxy between the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Rebel Alliance]]". The ''themes'' explored in the films might be "moral ambiguity" or "the conflict between technology and nature".

Themes differ from [[motif (visual arts)|motifs in the visual arts]] in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole, while motifs are elements of the content.  In the same way, a literary story with repeated symbolism related to chess does not make the story's theme the similarity of life to chess. Themes arise from the interplay of the plot, the characters, and the attitude the author takes to them, and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors.

'''Water conservation''' includes all the policies, strategies and activities to [[sustainably]] manage the [[natural resource]] of [[fresh water]], to protect the [[hydrosphere]], and to meet the current and future human  [[demand]]. Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as [[climate change]] have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in [[manufacturing]] and agricultural [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/conserve/|title=Water conservation « Defra |work=defra.gov.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many US cities have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf|title=Cases in Water Conservation: How Efficiency Programs Help Water Utilities Save Water and Avoid Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA.gov|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of water conservation efforts include:
* Ensuring [[water resources|availability of water]] for future generations where the withdrawal of [[freshwater]] from an [[ecosystem]] does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
* [[Energy conservation]] as water pumping, delivery and [[wastewater treatment]] facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total [[electricity consumption]] is devoted to [[water management]]. 
* [[Habitat conservation]] where minimizing human water use helps to preserve [[freshwater habitat]]s for local wildlife and migrating [[waterfowl]], but also [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hermoso |first1=Virgilio |last2=Abell |first2=Robin |last3=Linke |first3=Simon |last4=Boon |first4=Philip |title=The role of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation: challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world |journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems |date=2016 |volume=26 |issue=S1 |pages=3–11 |doi=10.1002/aqc.2681|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2681/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

The key activities that benefit water conservation(save water) are as follows:
#Any beneficial reduction in [[Drying|water loss]], use and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Duane D. Baumann|author2=John J. Boland|author3=John H. Sims|date=April 1984|title=Water Conservation: The Struggle over Definition|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=20|pages=428–434|url=  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR020i004p00428/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Avoiding any damage to [[water quality]].
#Improving [[water management]] practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use and Conservation |last=Vickers |first=Amy |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= water plow Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=1-931579-07-5 |page=434 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geerts | first1 = S. | last2 = Raes | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Deficit irrigation as an  on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas | doi = 10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 | journal = Agric. Water Manage | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 1275–1284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One strategy in water conservation is [[rain water harvesting]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Kurunthachalam|first=Senthil|year=2014|title=Water Conservation and Sustainability: An Utmost Importance.|url=|journal=Hydrol Current Res|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Another strategy in water conservation is protecting [[groundwater]] resources.

An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of  groundwater water supply.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.

A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delgado|first1=Jorge A.|last2=Groffman|first2=Peter M.|last3=Nearing|first3=Mark A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Tom|last5=Reicosky|first5=Don|last6=Lal|first6=Rattan|last7=Kitchen|first7=Newell R.|last8=Rice|first8=Charles W.|last9=Towery|first9=Dan|last10=Salon|first10=Paul|title=Conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change|journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation|date=1 July 2011|volume=66|issue=4|pages=118A–129A|doi=10.2489/jswc.66.4.118A|url=http://www.jswconline.org/content/66/4/118A.refs|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en|issn=0022-4561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Social solutions ==
[[File:VineyardDrip.JPG|thumb|right|[[Drip irrigation]] system in [[New Mexico]]]]
Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal [[water industry|water utilities]] or regional governments.  Common strategies include public [[outreach]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateruseitwisely.com "Water - Use It Wisely."] U.S. multi-city public outreach program. Park &amp; Co., Phoenix, AZ. Accessed 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Cases in Water Conservation |url=http://www.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf |author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Document No. EPA-832-B-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of [[xeriscaping]] or [[natural landscaping]] in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/132/222/ |title= Xeriscape Rebates |author= Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |authorlink= |date= 2009-02-06 |work= |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heberger|first=Matthew|year=2014|title=Issue Brief|url=http://pacinst.org/app/uploads/2014/06/ca-water-urban.pdf|journal=Urban Water Conservation and efficiency Potential in California|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses.

One fundamental conservation goal is universal metering. The prevalence of residential [[water meter]]ing varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-60279.html "Time for universal water metering?"] ''Innovations Report.'' May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and about 61% of urban Canadian homes (as of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Municipal Water Use, 2001 Statistics |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/water-apps/en/info/pubs/sss/e_mun2001.pdf |author=Environment Canada |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Cat. No. En11-2/2001E-PDF. {{ISBN|0-662-39504-2}}. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/nps-conserve.html |title=How to Conserve Water and Use It Effectively |author=EPA |date=2010-01-13 |work= |location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize [[water leakage]].  Water metering would benefit society, in the long run, it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come.  One would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges, this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by the public, domestic and manufacturing services.

Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimentel, Berger|title=Water resources: agricultural and environmental issues |journal=BioScience |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=909 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0909:WRAAEI]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common.  Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force [[farmers]] to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste.  Also available are modern [[shower head]]s that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Household applications ==
The Home Water Works website contains useful information on household water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-water-works.org|title=Water Usage Calculator, Water Conservation and Efficiency - Home Water Works|website=www.home-water-works.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1316402111|title=Perceptions of water use|first=Shahzeen Z.|last=Attari|date=26 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=201316402|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316402111|pmid=24591608|pmc=3986180}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two [[Residential water use in the U.S. and Canada|household end use logging]] studies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, P.W.; DeOreo, W.B.; Opitz, E.M.; Kiefer, J.C.; Davis, W.Y.; Dziegielewski, B.; &amp; Nelson, J.O., 1999.

Water-saving technology for the home includes:
#Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
#[[Low flush toilet|Low-flush toilet]]s and [[composting toilet]]s. These have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western [[toilet]]s use large volumes of water
#[[Dual flush toilet]]s created by [[Caroma]] includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets
#[[Faucet aerator]]s, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain "wetting effectiveness" while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
#[[Raw water flushing]] where toilets use sea water or non-purified water
#[[Reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or recycling systems, allowing:
#*Reuse of [[greywater|graywater]] for flushing toilets or watering gardens
#*Recycling of wastewater through [[water purification|purification]] at a water treatment plant. ''See also [[Wastewater#Reuse|Wastewater - Reuse]]''
#[[Rainwater harvesting]]
#High-efficiency [[washing machine|clothes washer]]s
#Weather-based irrigation controllers
#[[Garden hose]] [[nozzle]]s that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run.
# Low flow taps in wash basins
#[[Swimming pool]] covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs.
#[[Automatic faucet]] is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.

== Commercial applications ==
Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes:
*[[Waterless urinal]]s
*[[Waterless car wash]]es
*[[Infrared]] or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
*Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
*[[Radiography|X-ray]] film processor re-circulation systems
*[[Cooling tower]] conductivity controllers
*Water-saving [[steam sterilizer]]s, for use in hospitals and health care facilities
*[[Rain water harvesting]]
*Water to Water [[heat exchanger]]s.

== Agricultural applications ==
[[Image:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Overhead irrigation, [[Center pivot irrigation|center pivot]] design]]
For crop irrigation, optimal [[water efficiency]] means minimizing losses due to [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or subsurface drainage while maximizing production.  An [[evaporation pan]] in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements.  [[surface irrigation|Flood irrigation]], the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. [[Irrigation#Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation|Overhead irrigation]], using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. [[Drip irrigation]] is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/outdoor/tech.html|title=Water-Saving Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.

As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system.  This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"/&gt; Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that "[i]mproved [[soil organic matter]] from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains",&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season.

== Water Reuse ==
Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world's population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and exponential [[population growth]], has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0|title=Wastewater Reuse and Current Challenges - Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of methods used in the [[Water treatment|treatment of waste water]] to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water.

Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elimelech|first=Menachem|last2=Phillip|first2=William A.|date=2011-08-05|title=The Future of Seawater Desalination: Energy, Technology, and the Environment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/712|journal=Science|language=en|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=712–717|doi=10.1126/science.1200488|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21817042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Songlee|last2=Rhee|first2=Young-Woo|last3=Kang|first3=Seong-Pil|date=2017-02-17|title=Investigation of salt removal using cyclopentane hydrate formation and washing treatment for seawater desalination|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916416309742|journal=Desalination|volume=404|pages=132–137|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeger|first=Eva M.|last2=Braeckevelt|first2=Mareike|last3=Reiche|first3=Nils|last4=Müller|first4=Jochen A.|last5=Kästner|first5=Matthias|date=2016-10-01|title=Removal of pathogen indicators from secondary effluent using slow sand filtration: Optimization approaches|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857416303937|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=95|pages=635–644|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=D.|last2=Bertelkamp|first2=C.|last3=Kegel|first3=F.

The removal of [[pathogen]]s from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerba|first=Charles P.|last2=Betancourt|first2=Walter Q.|last3=Kitajima|first3=Masaaki|title=How much reduction of virus is needed for recycled water: A continuous changing need for assessment?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541630865X|journal=Water Research|volume=108|pages=25–31|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.020|pmid=27838026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wasting of water ==
[[File:Leaking garden hose bib.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaking garden hose bib]]
Wasting of water (also called "water waste" in the U.S.) is the flip side of water conservation and, in household applications, it means causing or permitting discharge of water without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. By [[EPA]] estimate, household leaks in the U.S. can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts |title=Statistics and Facts &amp;amp;#124; WaterSense &amp;amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to the somewhat fuzzy concept of '''water waste'''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/bibarticles/neuman_forfeiture.pdf |title=Janet C. Neuman. Beneficial Use, Waste, and Forfeiture:The Inefficient Search for Efficiency in Western Water Use |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are “causing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcode.us/codes/roseville/view.php?topic=14-14_09-14_09_030&amp;frames=off |title=14.09.030 Definition of water waste |website=Qcode.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example, the city code also clarifies that “in the case of washing, “discharge,” “flow” or “run to waste” means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste. Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saws.org/conservation/waterwaste/whatiswaste.cfm |title=SAWS Report Water Waste - What is Water Waste? |website=Saws.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvvwd.com/conservation/waste.html |title=Water Waste |website=Lvvwd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Water Service company in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.calwater.com/conservation/water-waste-report/ |title=Report Water Waste |publisher=Cal Water |date=2015-12-03 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and City of San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/water/conservation/kids/tips |title=Water Saving Tips &amp;#124; City of San Diego Official Website |website=Sandiego.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2336&amp;TargetID=235,310 |title=Water &amp; Drought Update - Palo Alto Water Use Guidelines |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.water.vic.gov.au/liveable-cities-and-towns/permanent-water-saving-rules |title=Permanent water saving rules |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary water use bans (also known as "hosepipe bans") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/tubs&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the [[hydrologic cycle]] and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is "wasted" is the community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. A concept that is closely related to water wasting is "water-use efficiency." Water use is considered [[inefficiency|inefficient]] if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical [[efficiency]] derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dziegielewski, B. J.|author2=Kiefer, C.|title=Water Conservation Measurement Metrics: Guidance Report|journal=American Water Works Association|date=January 22, 2010|url=https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/resources/resource%20dev%20groups/tech%20and%20educ%20program/documents/WaterConservationMeasurementMetricsGuidanceReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). However, the technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as [[economic efficiency]] and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.

The '''Newby-McMahon Building''', commonly referred to as the '''world's littlest skyscraper''', is located at 701 La Salle (on the corner of Seventh and La Salle streets) in downtown [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]]. This late [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style red brick and [[cast stone]] structure is {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; and its exterior dimensions are {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt; Its interior dimensions are approximately {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|108|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

Reportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a [[Confidence trick|confidence man]], the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in [[Robert Ripley]]'s ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper," a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wichita County, Texas|Depot Square Historic District]] of Wichita Falls, a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]].

==Background==
A large [[petroleum reservoir]] was discovered just west of the city of [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]], a small town in [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita County]], Texas in 1912.&lt;ref name=Kelly1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olien2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2010/&gt; Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became [[boomtown]]s, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative [[oil field]], and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and [[mineral rights]] deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;

==Proposal and blueprints==
The Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909),&lt;ref name=WDT1909/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company.&lt;ref name=OK1898/&gt; The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a [[Landman (oil worker)|petroleum landman]] and [[structural engineer]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;

According to local legend,&lt;ref name=Kelso2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|edition=3rd|chapter=North Texas|page=112|author=Kelso J|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|location=Kearney, Nebraska|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7627-4109-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gW9ye7wu0E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Texas+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;&lt;ref name=TAC20000915/&gt; McMahon collected $200,000 (US ${{Inflation|US|200000|1919|r=-5|fmt=c}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in [[Financial capital|investment capital]] from this group of naive investors, promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the [[St. James Hotel (Wichita Falls, Texas)|St. James Hotel]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

The key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit, was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be {{convert|480|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fodors2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and {{convert|480|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Construction and ensuing legal battle==
McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; As the building began to take shape, the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four-story edifice that was only {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, rather than the {{convert|480|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure they were expecting.

They brought a lawsuit against McMahon, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge &amp;ndash; as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved, no legal remedy was available for the deceived investors.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt; By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Early occupancy and subsequent abandonment==
Upon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010327/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20040506/&gt; The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990917/&gt;

The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a [[resource curse]] to Wichita Falls, and the [[Texas Oil Boom]] ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the [[Great Depression]] struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt;

After the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense.&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

==Purchase and renovation==
By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS.&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990810/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991018/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991020/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20000806/&gt; The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20001216/&gt;

On June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as {{convert|97|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A 15-ft (4.6-m) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20030614/&gt; The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 in funds from the city's [[tax increment financing]] fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt; Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000, the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter, Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric).&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt;

With the passage of time, the Newby-McMahon Building has become a monument to a long-gone era. It has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed, genius, graft, and gullibility of the [[oil boom]] days of [[North Texas]].&lt;ref name=OConnor1986/&gt; The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls,&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; which has been declared a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990319/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Depot Square Historic District |work=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]] |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2003001552 |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a [[skyscraper]],&lt;ref name=ESN24419/&gt; nor even that of a "[[Tower block|highrise]]" building.&lt;ref name=ESN18727/&gt; After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050728/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20070326/&gt; Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building.  At times, floors of the skyscraper have been subleased to various local artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGinnis|first1=Judith|title=Downtown retail future gets boost from the past|publisher=Wichita Falls Times Record News|date=Feb 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newby-McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film ''Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past'', a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20061202/&gt;
