'''Advanced Placement Human Geography''' (also known as '''AP Human Geo''', '''AP Geography''', '''APHG''', '''AP HuGe''', '''HGAP''', '''AP HuGs''', '''APHUG''', '''AP HUMAN''', or '''High School Ap Human''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[social studies]] course that studies [[human geography]]. The test is administered by [[College Board]].

This college-level course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of [[Earth]]'s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analyses to analyze human social organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice.

== Exam ==
The AP Human Geography Exam consists of two sections. The first section consists of 75 [[multiple choice]] questions and the second section consists of 3 free-response questions. The sections are 60 and 75 minutes long, respectively. It is not necessary to answer the free-response questions in essay form; instead, points are awarded on certain key words, examples, and other vital aspects.

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-human-geography-course-description.pdf AP Human Geography:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Human Geography==
The curriculum consists of informational book-related homework, which often requires students to strive to learn information independently. The curriculum teaches about diffusion, human traits, religion, and population clusters.

Muhammad bin Umar bin Abd al-Rahman bin Abd Allah al-Aqil, better known as '''Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri''', is a Saudi Arabian [[polymath]]. He has, at various times, been referred to as a [[theologian]], [[jurist]], [[historian]], [[ethnographer]], [[geographer]], [[poet]], [[critic]] and [[author]].&lt;ref name=saido&gt;Dr. Amin Sulayman Sidu,  [http://www.addiriyah.org/tahrer/index.htm Bibliography and abridged biography of Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]. [[King Fahad National Library]] Academid Journal, vol. 3, iss. #2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of Saudi Arabia's "Golden Generation," he knew of life both during the poverty of the pre-[[oil boom]] era and the prosperity of the 1950s onward.

==Personal life==
Ibn Aqil was born in the city of [[Shaqraa]] in Saudi Arabia's central [[Najd]] region in 1942.&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; His has been married three times, during which he sired twenty-six children. His current wife is from [[Egypt]]. Ibn Aqil also owns a bookstore, "Dar Ibn Hazm," in the [[As-Suwaidi (Riyadh)|Al-Suwaidi]] district where he currently{{year needed|date=May 2015}} lives, and is the prayer leader of a nearby [[mosque]].

Ibn Aqil had a complicated friendship and, later, rivalry with fellow Arab philosopher [[Abdullah al-Qasemi]]. Having known al-Qasemi before he converted from Islam to atheism, Ibn Aqil met al-Qasemi for a debate in the [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]] district of [[Downtown Cairo]]. After a long discussion regarding the [[existence of God]] and [[Theodicy]], Ibn Aqil authored the book ''A Night in Garden City'' as an account of the debate.

==Career==
After receiving his primary and secondary education in Shaqraa, Ibn Aqil relocated to [[Riyadh]] and enrolled in [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]], which at the time was a brand new institution. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science in Law]] from the college of [[Sharia|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name=who66&gt;''Who's Who in Saudi Arabia 1978-1979'', pg. 66. Part of the [[Who's Who]] series. Edited by M. Samir Sarhan. [[Jeddah]] and [[London]]: [[Tihama (company)|Tihama]] and [[Europa Publications]]. {{ISBN|0905118286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who176&gt;''Who's Who in the Arab World 1990-1991'', pg. 176. Part of the Who's Who series. Edited by Gabriel M. Bustros. [[Beirut]]: Publitec Publications, 10th ed. {{ISBN|2903188076}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Master of Theology]] degree in [[Tafsir|exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; During this time, Ibn Aqil was a student of former Saudi [[Grand Mufti]] [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]] and [[Ibn Humaid]], another high-ranking cleric. Zahiri spent most of his tutelage under [[Abu Turab al-Zahiri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.al-madina.com/node/198204 Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri: The Zahiri school was the fourth school before the Hanbalis existed]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Al Madina (newspaper)|Al Madina]], Iss. #17340. 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his twenties and early thirties, Ibn Aqil worked as a lawyer within Saudi Arabia's theocratic justice system. He was eventually placed in administrative positions for public education in the country's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|eastern province]] in [[Dammam]], and then later moved to the legal department in the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs.&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; Upon returning to Riyadh, he founded and served as president of the Riyadh Literary Society, and began writing a regular column for the Arabic daily [[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]]; while he continues the latter endeavor, he relinquished his presidency of the Society and joined the general membership. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Ibn Aqil served in several posts including that of a legal adviser to the Riyadh Municipal Agency, auditor of the General Employees Bureau and Director of Services for the General Administration of Girls' Education.&lt;ref name=who66/&gt;&lt;ref name=who176/&gt;

In the past, he was the host of "Tafsir al-Tafasir" or "exegesis of the exegeses," a religious program which was broadcast daily on the radio and weekly on television. Building on his graduate background, Ibn Aqil would systematically collect all [[List of tafsir works|major explanations]] of the Qur'an within Sunni Islam and attempt to integrate all of them, weighing the views of various theologians. Although the program was discontinued in the late 1980s, Ibn Aqil restarted his broadcasts in 2010 from where he had left off.&lt;ref&gt;Saheefah.org. [http://www.saheefah.org/2010/08/08/the-ruling-of-tafsir-and-its-categories/ The ruling of Tafsir and its Categories].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King Faisal Foundation#King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies|King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies]] had invited Ibn Aqil to grant a symposium on the topic of comparative exegesis five years prior, likely reigniting public interest.

Currently, Ibn Aqil has mostly retired from public life. In addition to his renewed Qur'an study broadcasts, he is a member of the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo]],&lt;ref name=saido/&gt; the Arabic Language Academy at Mecca,&lt;ref name=mujamma&gt;[http://www.m-a-arabia.com/site/8626.html أبو عبدالرحمن ابن عقيل الظاهري]. Official website of the Academy, 9 February 2015. Accessed 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and still serves as the editor-in-chief of an academic journal named after the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Diriyah]], which he founded and which holds its headquarters on his family estate.&lt;ref name=mujamma/&gt;

==Views==
Ibn Aqil has defined the problems of Saudi society as coming both from secularists on one end of the spectrum and Muslim clerics delivering hasty and erroneous proclamations on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Sa'd al-Bahis, [http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20070531/Con20070531114595.htm "Abu Abd al-Rahman: Masha`ikh al-ummah mun'azilun fikriyan wa mashghulun bi-ta'lim al-furoo'."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301102709/http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20070531/Con20070531114595.htm |date=March 1, 2011 }} [[Okaz]]: 31 May 2007, iss. #2174.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a part of Saudi Arabia's "Golden Generation," Ibn Aqil has generally been supportive of the [[House of Saud]] and the Saudi government, and an opponent of its critics among both liberal modernists and radical extremists.

Recently, Ibn Aqil called for the Saudi government to strip a dissident journalist of his citizenship due to his sharp criticisms of the [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq al-Homayed, [http://arabnews.com/node/226377 "Buraidah — a misunderstood Saudi city."] [[Arab News]], Monday, 2 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the spectrum, Ibn Aqil engaged in a public series of exchanges with fellow cleric [[Abdul-Rahman al-Barrak]] in 2011 due to the former's refusal to adopt a formal position on theological issues debated during the [[Mihna]], a rare Medieval-era [[inquisition]] within Islam perpetrated by rationalists against their orthodox counterparts. Ibn Aqil has also fallen into conflict with [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] cleric [[Yusuf al-Qardawi]] in a series of back-and-forth columns, though Qardawi did not mention Ibn Aqil by name.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid al-Saif, [http://www.alsharq.net.sa/2012/10/06/521116 "This is what Ibn Aqil said about Qardawi!"] 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil, who has expressed skepticism about the goals and results of the [[Arab Spring]], considered Qardawi's various positions during the movement hypocritical and contradictory, charges which Qardawi denied.

==Works==
Being a jurist and scholar of the [[Zahiri]]te school of law within Sunni Islam, Ibn Aqil is also the current era's primary biography of Zahirite theologian [[Ibn Hazm]], having written detailed accounts even of Ibn Hazm's individual conflicts with rival jurist [[Abu al-Walid al-Baji]].&lt;ref name=fierro&gt;[[Maribel Fierro]], "Heresy in al-Andalus." Taken from ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain,'' pg. 905. Ed. [[Salma Jayyusi]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; His bookstore is named after the Andalusian author, and Ibn Aqil has authored a number of books on the life and career of Ibn Hazm. The largest of these books is ''Nawadir al-Imam Ibn Hazm'', a collection of Ibn Hazm's smaller, harder-to-find works, such as his poem on the fundamental principles of Zahirite law.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Miguel Puerta Vilchez, "Inventory of Ibn Hazm's Works." Taken from ''Ibn ?azm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker'', pg. 733. Eds. Camilla Adang, Maribel Fierro and [[Sabine Schmidtke]]. Volume 103 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 1 The Near and Middle East. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. {{ISBN|9789004234246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also delivered a lecture explaining [[Ibn Rushd]]'s attempts to reconcile philosophy and religion at the International Averroes Symposium, co-sponsored by UNESCO in [[Carthage]] between February 16 and 22 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Fakhry, [http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/626_V15N2%20Summer%2098%20-%20Conference%20Report%20-%20Celebrating%20Ibn%20Rushds%20Eight-Hundredth%20Anniversary.pdf "Celebrating Ibn Rushd's Eight-Hundredth Anniversary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928114659/http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/626_V15N2%20Summer%2098%20-%20Conference%20Report%20-%20Celebrating%20Ibn%20Rushds%20Eight-Hundredth%20Anniversary.pdf |date=2013-09-28 }} pg. 168. The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 15, iss. 2, pgs. 167-169. Conference report.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''A Night in Garden City'', other titles of some note are ''[[Descartes]] Between Scepticism and Certainty'' and ''The History of Najd During the Colloquial Epoch''.&lt;ref name=who66/&gt;&lt;ref name=who176/&gt; Perhaps stemming from his philosophical debates with al-Qasemi, reconciliation between reason and revelation has been a recurring theme in Ibn Aqil's work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

'''Artful Learning''' is an educational philosophy model that is concept-based and interdisciplinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |title=Evaluation of the Artful Learning Program |work=cse.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627172329/http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artful Learning was initiated by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and is rooted in using the arts to enhance all areas of education.

==History==
In 1990, Leonard Bernstein received the [[Praemium Imperiale]], an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through
the Arts (BETA) Fund, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/pfr/pfr_FALL05_rev2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Bernstein provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Center&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/lbcenter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, resulting in the Bernstein Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webadrenaline.com/artful-2-3-04/about/mission.html |title=History of the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning |work=webadrenaline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six years of association with the Grammy Foundation, the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moved to [[Gettysburg College]], PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=cfc1e09f-506b-4cc0-ba24-aa67803f635c |title=Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moves to Gettysburg College |work=gettysburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==

Artful Learning is based on Bernstein's philosophy that the arts can strengthen learning and be incorporated in all academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.nl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=dp2013 |title=THE LEONARD BERNSTEIN ARTFUL LEARNING MODEL: A CASE STUDY OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL |work=digitalcommons.nl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is based on "units of study," which each consist of four core elements: experience, inquire, create, and reflect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-bernstein/leonard-bernsteins-artsba_b_3427779.html |title=Leonard Bernstein's Arts-Based Education Revolution |work=huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research shows that participation in the arts plays a vital role in influencing brain development and performance. Arts which are considered enrichment in education programs, may in fact be central to the way humans neurologically process and learn.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507091.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/65g5z7wp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irma-international.org/chapter/artful-learning/106314/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iakFqWZGvhkC&amp;pg=PA1059&amp;lpg=PA1059&amp;dq=research+%2B+%22artful+learning%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IBo6GMysV6&amp;sig=CjaivsVuLUaBhpDD5QQK6VV61t4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0ZeoVIbtD9eJuASxg4KQCQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=research%20%2B%20%22artful%20learning%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] teamed up with the Arts Education Partnership to publish a comprehensive study on the inclusion of the [[arts in education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~bcec/events/RFKS/RFKS2011/artful.html |title=Artful Learning |work=indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO)''' is the study of [[matter]]-matter and [[light]]-matter interactions; at the scale of one or a few [[atom]]s&lt;ref name=nap&gt;{{cite book|title=Atomic, molecular, and optical physics|year=1986|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=978-0-309-03575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy scales around several [[electron volt]]s.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of atomic, molecular, and optical physics|author=Editor: Gordon Drake (Various authors)|year=1996|edition=|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-0-387-20802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1356}}&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=L. T. (ed.)|title=Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics: New Research|year=2009|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-907-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three areas are closely interrelated.  AMO theory includes [[classical physics|classical]], [[Semiclassical physics|semi-classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments.  Typically, the theory and applications of [[Emission spectrum|emission]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) from [[Excited state|excited]] [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, analysis of spectroscopy, generation of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s, and the optical properties of matter in general, fall into these categories.

== Atomic and molecular physics ==
{{main article|Atomic physics|Molecular physics}}
'''Atomic physics''' is the subfield of AMO that studies atoms as an isolated system of [[electron]]s and an [[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]], while '''molecular physics''' is the study of the physical properties of [[molecule]]s. The term ''atomic physics'' is often associated with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear bomb]]s, due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and [[nuclear physics]], which considers [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] alone. The important experimental techniques are the various types of [[spectroscopy]]. Molecular physics, while closely related to [[atomic physics]], also overlaps greatly with [[theoretical chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]] and [[chemical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|page=803|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|author=C.B. Parker|year=1994|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both subfields are primarily concerned with [[electronic structure]] and the dynamical processes by which these arrangements change. Generally this work involves using quantum mechanics. For molecular physics, this approach is known as [[quantum chemistry]]. One important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential [[atomic orbital]] theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the [[molecular orbital]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 9|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is additionally concerned with effects due to the [[molecular structure]]. Additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete [[energy level]]s. The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational [[Spectrum|spectra]] are in the far [[infrared]] region (about 30 - 150 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [[Vibrational spectroscopy of linear molecules|Vibrational spectra]] are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5&amp;nbsp;µm) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and [[ultraviolet]] regions. From measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 12, 13, 17|page=|title=The Light Fantastic – Introduction to Classic and Quantum Optics|author=I.R. Kenyon|year=2008|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of ''atomic, molecular, and optical physics''. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

There is no strong distinction, however, between optical physics, applied optics, and optical engineering, since the devices of optical engineering and the applications of applied optics are necessary for basic research in optical physics, and that research leads to the development of new devices and applications. Often the same people are involved in both the basic research and the applied technology development, for example the experimental demonstration of [[electromagnetically induced transparency]] by [[S. E. Harris]] and of [[slow light]] by Harris and [[Lene Vestergaard Hau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencewatch.com/nobel/predictions/slow-light |title=Slow Light |website=Science Watch |accessdate=Jan 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 9,10|page=|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B.

Researchers in optical physics use and develop light sources that span the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from [[microwave]]s to [[X-ray]]s. The field includes the generation and detection of light, linear and [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] optical processes, and [[spectroscopy]]. [[Laser]]s and [[laser spectroscopy]] have transformed optical science.  Major study in optical physics is also devoted to [[quantum optics]] and [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], and to [[femtosecond]] optics.&lt;ref name="nap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atomic, molecular, and optical physics|year=1986|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=978-0-309-03575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In optical physics, support is also provided in areas such as the nonlinear response of isolated atoms to intense, ultra-short electromagnetic fields, the atom-cavity interaction at high fields, and quantum properties of the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|pages=933–934|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|author=C.B.

Other important areas of research include the development of novel optical techniques for nano-optical measurements, [[diffractive optics]], [[Interferometry|low-coherence interferometry]], [[optical coherence tomography]], and [[Near-field scanning optical microscope|near-field microscopy]].  Research in optical physics places an emphasis on ultrafast optical science and technology. The applications of optical physics create advancements in [[telecommunication|communications]], [[medicine]], [[manufacturing]], and even [[entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=5, 6, 10, 16|page=|title=The Light Fantastic – Introduction to Classic and Quantum Optics|author=I.

==History==
{{Main article|Atomic theory|Basics of quantum mechanics}}
[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bohr model]] of the [[Hydrogen atom]]]]
One of the earliest steps towards ''atomic physics'' was the recognition that matter was composed of ''atoms'', in modern terms the basic unit of a [[chemical element]]. This theory was developed by [[John Dalton]] in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were - although they could be described and classified by their observable properties in bulk; summarized by the developing [[periodic table]], by [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]] and [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]] around the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 7, 8|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the connection between atomic physics ''and'' optical physics became apparent, by the discovery of [[spectral line]]s and attempts to describe the phenomenon - notably by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]], [[Fresnel]], and others in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|pages=4–11|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B. Band|year=2010|edition=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89931-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time to the 1920s, physicists were seeking to explain [[atomic spectra]] and [[blackbody radiation]]. One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the [[Bohr atom model]].&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"/&gt;

Experiments including [[electromagnetic radiation]] and matter - such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Compton effect]], and spectra of sunlight the due to the unknown element of [[Helium]], the limitation of the Bohr model to Hydrogen, and numerous other reasons, lead to an entirely new mathematical model of matter and light: [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 34|page=|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics|author1=P. A. Tipler |author2=G. Mosca |year=2008|edition=|publisher=Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-8964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical oscillator model of matter===
Early models to explain the origin of the [[refractive index|index of refraction]] treated an [[electron]] in an atomic system classically according to the model of [[Paul Drude]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. The theory was developed to attempt to provide an origin for the wavelength-dependent refractive index ''n'' of a material. In this model, incident [[electromagnetic waves]] forced an electron bound to an atom to [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. The [[amplitude]] of the oscillation would then have a relationship to the [[frequency]] of the incident electromagnetic wave and the [[Resonance|resonant]] frequencies of the oscillator. The [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead to a wave which moved more slowly.

===Early quantum model of matter and light===
[[Max Planck]] derived a formula to describe the [[electromagnetic field]] inside a box when in [[thermal equilibrium]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8–9}}
His model consisted of a superposition of [[standing waves]]. In one dimension, the box has length ''L'', and only sinusoidal waves of [[wavenumber]]
:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{n\pi}{L} &lt;/math&gt;
can occur in the box, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]] (mathematically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n \in \mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt;). The equation describing these standing waves is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E=E_0 \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the [[electric field]] amplitude, and ''E'' is the magnitude of the electric field at position ''x''. From this basic, [[Planck's law]] was derived.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|4–8,51–52}}
&lt;!-- It's in the energy density form in the book --&gt;

In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] concluded, based on alpha particle scattering, that an atom has a central pointlike proton. He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. [[Niels Bohr]], in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

These results, based on a ''discrete'' set of specific standing waves, were inconsistent with the ''continuous'' classical oscillator model.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8}}

Work by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 on the [[photoelectric effect]] led to the association of a light wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; with a photon of energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. In 1917 Einstein created an extension to Bohrs model by the introduction of the three processes of [[stimulated emission]], [[spontaneous emission]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Modern treatments==
The largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation of quantum mechanics with the [[matrix mechanics]] approach by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and the discovery of the [[Schrödinger equation]] by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|12}}

There are a variety of semi-classical treatments within AMO. Which aspects of the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classically is dependent on the specific problem at hand. The semi-classical approach is ubiquitous in computational work within AMO, largely due to the large decrease in computational cost and complexity associated with it.

For matter under the action of a laser, a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic or molecular system is combined with the system being under the action of a classical electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|14}} Since the field is treated classically it can not deal with [[spontaneous emission]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|16}} This semi-classical treatment is valid for most systems,&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}} particular those under the action of high intensity laser fields.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|724}} The distinction between optical physics and quantum optics is the use of semi-classical and fully quantum treatments respectively.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}}

Within collision dynamics and using the semi-classical treatment, the internal degrees of freedom may be treated quantum mechanically, whilst the relative motion of the quantum systems under consideration are treated classically.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|556}} When considering medium to high speed collisions, the nuclei can be treated classically while the electron is treated quantum mechanically. In low speed collisions the approximation fails.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|754}}&lt;!-- Expand from here, weaknesses of the particular approximation are also described --&gt;

Classical Monte-Carlo methods for the dynamics of electrons can be described as semi-classical in that the initial conditions are calculated using a fully quantum treatment, but all further treatment is classical.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|871}}

==Isolated atoms and molecules==
Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules in isolation&lt;!-- not always, there are some multi-particle groups --&gt;. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons, whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its [[molecular hydrogen ion]]. It is concerned with processes such as [[ionization]], [[above threshold ionization]] and [[excited state|excitation]] by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers molecules in a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] then the time-scales for molecule-molecule interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic and molecular processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual molecules can be treated as if each were in isolation for the vast majority of the time.  By this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory in [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and [[atmospheric physics]] even though both deal with huge numbers of molecules.

==Electronic configuration==
Electrons form notional [[Electron shell|shells]] around the nucleus. These are naturally in a [[ground state]] but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ([[photon]]s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).

Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [[bound state]].  The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [[binding energy]].  Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [[kinetic energy]] according to the [[conservation of energy]].  The atom is said to have undergone the process of [[ionization]].

In the event that the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it may transition to an [[excited state]] or to a [[Virtual state (physics)|virtual state]]. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state via [[spontaneous emission]]. The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy.  However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the [[Auger effect]] may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are strict [[selection rules]] as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light—however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

The term "'''Atomic engineering'''" appears to have been first used in 1946 by Theodore von Kármán,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore von Kármán, "Atomic Engineering?", Journal of Applied Physics 17 (1946) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And now it seems we are at the threshold of the new atomic age. I do not know whether or not this is true, but certainly, we shall have 'atomic engineering' in the fields of power and transportation. Are we prepared for the problems involved?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Atomic power]], which, today, is generally considered to be in the discipline of [[nuclear engineering]], is an example of what he had in mind.

Atomic engineering may be a superset of [[nuclear engineering]], due to the historical usage of terms like [[Atoms for Peace]] , [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], 'atomic engineer', etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.
An inclusive definition is: "exploiting the atomic characters of matter for [[engineering]] applications." For example, an [[atomic clock]] and potential applications of [[ultracold atoms|ultra-cold atom]] belong to atomic engineering. The atomic character could be the atomic spin (e.g. in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[quantum computing]] applications), atomic position (e.g. [[Optical lattice]]), atomic mass (e.g. atomic power), etc.

The creation of the atomic bomb by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the "Father of the atomic bomb", is based on atomic engineering. Oppenheimer was a university professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

[[Richard Feynman]], in his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" on the trend of [[miniaturization]], envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether, ultimately – in the great future – we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them. … When we get to the very, very, small world – say circuits of seven atoms – we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom", Caltech Engineering and Science 23 (5), 22 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most practices of [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] today have foci distinct from Feynman's ultimate vision of manipulating individual atomic position and spin, which may be better described by "Atomic engineering", that addresses characteristic length scales from 1 [[femtometer]] (the [[atomic nucleus]] size) to 1 [[nanometer]] (about 5 atoms across in linear dimension).  Coherent quantum control of individual atomic defect like the [[Nitrogen-vacancy center]], and the eventual "[[3D atom printing]]" ("2D atom printing" was realized in 1990 by IBM&lt;ref&gt;D. M. EIGLER and E. K. SCHWEIZER, "Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunnelling microscope", Nature 344 (1990) 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]), fit Feynman's ultimate vision.

The '''Bachelor of Technology''' ([[Latin]] ''Baccalaureus Technologiae'', commonly abbreviated as '''B.Tech.'''; with Honours as '''B.Tech. (Hons.)'''; or '''BTech''') is an [[Undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] conferred after completion of a three-year, a four-year or even a five-year (such as in Nigeria) program of studies at an accredited university or accredited university-level institution. B.Tech. is considered as skill-oriented course. The degree is conferred in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the United States and elsewhere.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], stand-alone Bachelor of Technology (BTech) programs are uncommon. Most of the Australian BTech degrees have [[Engineering education|engineering]] and/or [[information technology]] as their focus.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the Bachelor of Technology designation is used inconsistently. Both universities and community colleges award the degree after completion of four-year programs but have different entrance requirements.

Care should be taken not to confuse the B.Tech. degree offered by university-level institutions with the [[Bachelor of Applied Technology]] (B.A.Tech.) or BAT offered by some community colleges in Canada. Community colleges are represented by the [[Association of Canadian Community Colleges]] (ACCC) and university-level institutions by the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC)]], the national accrediting body of universities in Canada. However, some community college engineering programs have recently been accredited by Engineers Canada following a thorough review by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), i.e., Conestoga College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs1.conestogac.on.ca/news/2010/09/conestoga_first_college_in_ont.php "Non-Universities receive engineering accreditation from the CEAB:"]&lt;/ref&gt; CEAB accreditation allows licensing as a "Professional Engineer (P.Eng.)" and ensures that graduates of these programs can continue with graduate engineering studies at traditional universities.

Care should be taken not to confuse the B.Tech. degree with the [[P.Tech]] (Engineering) in Alberta designation used in Canada by the engineering technologists and technicians associations. P.Tech (Engineering) allow engineering practice independently same as professional engineer, which is attained by after completion of a 2-3 year Engineering Technology diploma program.

==India==
In [[India]], BTech (Bachelor of Technology) and BE ([[Bachelor of Engineering]]) both are same degrees and offered in engineering disciplines.

Bachelor of Technology or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] qualifications include the following:

* 3 years BE/BTech after [[Diploma in Engineering]]
* 4 years BE/BTech after class 12

Degree is regulated under the aegis of [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination.

==Kenya==
The B.Tech. degree was recently introduced in [[Kenya]] and is consequently not a very common course, with only one or two schools offering it. [[Technical University of Kenya]] (TU-K), located in the country's capital, offers a B.Tech. in Engineering and Information Technology. The duration of study is usually 4 years with 11 semesters in total, with two academic semesters per year and an industrial Based Learning (IDBL) semester for years two through four.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tukenya.ac.ke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nigeria==
In [[Nigeria]], The B.Tech. degree is awarded by Universities of Technology or Science and Technology which can be Federal, State or Privately owned. The duration of study is usually five years of ten semesters. Nine of these semesters is spent in the university while one (usually the second semester of the fourth year) is spent on compulsory Industrial Training (IT) ranging from three to six months although it can extend for a whole session (usually the whole fourth year) for students of Agriculture related courses. At inception most of the universities offered core Science courses, but have now expanded their course offerings to include Social Sciences and even Medicine. There are five Federal universities of Technology in Nigeria located in [[Minna]], [[Akure]], [[Owerri]], [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]] and [[Bauchi]] with some state and privately owned ones around the country.

==Pakistan==
In [[Pakistan]], Bachelor of Technology - B.Tech. (old name) or Bachelor of Science in Technology/Engineering Technology - BSc/BS Technology/Engineering Technology (new name) is a four years undergraduate engineering technology degree in which first 3 years (six semesters) are study years and in the final or 4th year (7th and 8th semesters), students undergo a supervised industrial training. Degree holders are called engineering technologists. The accrediting body of engineering technology degree is [[National Technology Council (Pakistan)]] (NTC) which is also responsible for registration of engineering technologists.

==South Africa==
In [[South Africa]], the B.Tech. is awarded by [[List of universities in South Africa#Universities of technology|Universities of Technology]] and [[List of universities in South Africa#Comprehensive universities|Comprehensive Universities]] - as distinct from [[List of universities in South Africa#Traditional universities|Traditional Universities]] -  and is generally practice or career oriented, as opposed to academically oriented. &lt;!-- The BTech (Eng) is the qualification which converts a diploma in an engineering faculty into the equivalent qualification carried by an engineer with a [[B.Eng]] or [[BSc(Eng)]]. --&gt; It is often offered in areas in which there is no corresponding  [[B.Sc.]] or [[BComm]] (e.g. B.Tech.: [[Forest management|Forestry Management]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.co.za/uploads/File/links/forestry_education/Saasveld%20info%20for%20FSA%20website.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or B.Tech.: Explosives Management &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/service_dept/docs/CEMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

The degree is obtained after 4 years of study and is usually offered as a 1-year program, following completion of a relevant three-year [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].

The B.Tech. carries the same points as other bachelor's degrees in terms of [[South African Qualifications Authority|South Africa's National Qualifications Framework]] (both having an NQF level of 7) At the same time, however, due to its orientation, it does not usually grant admission to the corresponding [[M.Sc.]] or [[MComm]] program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/coursesandprogrammes/PostgraduateCourses/Documents/UJ%20MCom%20Courses%20Brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and students instead pursue the Master of Technology (M.Tech.) and Doctor of Technology (D.Tech.) degrees; it does grant admission to [[MBA]] programs (see [[List of business schools in South Africa]]). In some cases, however, admission may be granted, once demonstrated that the student meets the necessary academic level to complete the requirements of the M.Sc or MComm.

==Sri Lanka==
In [[Sri Lanka]], The [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] (since 1980 under [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]) is the pioneer in offering the BTech Eng (Hons) which has a duration of minimum four years. Undergraduates can be specialised in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and communication Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering and Textile and Apparel Technology.

The BTech is offered in Sri Lanka by the [[University of Vocational Technology]] in following fields of  Multimedia &amp; Web, Network, Software, Construction Technology and Resource management, Building Services Technology, [[Manufacturing]], [[Mechatronics]], Food Process, Film &amp; Television, Industrial Management and Quantity Surveying.

University of Sri Jayawardenapura of Sri Lanka is offering Bachelor of Technology degrees in Engineering Technology ,Bio systems Technology and Information Communication Technology, as BET , BBST ,BICT .those all are four year honours degrees which are based on Sydney accord.

BTech is offered by the recently established [[Uva Wellassa University]] (under University Grants Commission) which has a duration of four years. This is known to be a specialized degree where they are subjected to specialize in three fields, Food Engineering &amp; Bioprocess Technology, Material science &amp; technology and Mechatronics.

The Faculty of Technology of the University of Colombo offers degrees in Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech), of a standard equivalent to Sri Lanka Qualification Framework (SLQF) Level 6.

==United States==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">The '''Borghild Project''' was a hoax purported to be evidence for a [[Nazi Germany|German]] project during [[World War II]] aimed at combating the spread of [[syphilis]] among Nazi troops by supplying soldiers with [[sex dolls]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] supposedly approved the project to distribute inflatable [[sex doll]]s to his soldiers, which could be transported in their backpacks in order to give them an option to avoid places of prostitution in [[Paris]]. After years of being considered a real project, the lack of evidence supporting its existence led to it being deemed a hoax in the early 2000s, for various reasons.

==Background==
The project was supposedly inspired by [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s 1940 memo to [[Adolf Hitler]] that there was a [[syphilis]] problem in the houses of prostitution in [[Paris]]. In the report, he wrote, "The greatest danger in Paris is the widespread and uncontrolled presence of whores."&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; As a result, Hitler is said to have given approval to create smaller-than-life dolls, which was designated to be designed under the supervision of [[Adam Zimmerman]] at the [[German Hygiene Museum]]. According to Rudolf Chargeheimer, a psychiatrist involved in the project, the doll was to have synthetic flesh that mirrored real flesh and its body should be as flexible as a real human. After [[Hungary|Hungarian]] actress [[Käthe von Nagy]] supposedly refused to model for the project, the doll was designed with blonde hair and blue eyes.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitler Gave Nazi Soldiers Blow Up Sex Dolls To Combat Syphilis: Book|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/12/hitler-nazi-sex-dolls_n_896207.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Anthony|title=The Sex Doll: A History|date=26 July 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786447947|pages=24–27|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr90CFnRkigC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Borghild+Project+fake&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p3sEV0xTlj&amp;sig=VHCr5E4-WeVU6CHsXJ9BUfQHAwc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TfzXVKzKDcPksATKo4HADw&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=Borghild%20Project%20fake&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
A total of fifty dolls were supposedly ordered for use in [[Jersey]] by officials, but the purported project was cancelled by Himmler after two years, after soldiers refused to carry them due to the fear of embarrassment if they were captured and one was found in their possession. The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] also supposedly destroyed the factories that were planned to build the dolls, as well as the records of the project.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;

==Hoax announcement==
According to supporters, the main supporting evidence for the project were two photographs purportedly rescued from the trash, which were later disproven as a hoax. Furthermore, the existence of a journalist named Norbert Lenz has also been questioned, as there is no proof that he ever existed in the first place, nor has any employee at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] ever recalled the project ever existing, when asked.&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;

==Film==
In 2009, a [[black comedy]] titled ''The Borghilde Project'' was released. Starring [[Jaye Davidson]], amongst other actors and actresses, the film presents the project as being factual, and was produced by [[Nobleman Films]].&lt;ref name=FF&gt;{{cite web|title=The Borghilde Project|url=http://www.festivalfocus.org/film/69709/the-borghilde-project|publisher=Festival Focus|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''budget''' is a financial plan for a defined period, often one year. It may also include planned sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities, costs and expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Companies, governments, families and other organizations use it to express strategic plans of activities or events in measurable terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIMA Official Terminology |url=http://www1.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810055251/http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A budget is the sum of money allocated for a particular purpose and the summary of intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them. It may include a budget surplus, providing money for use at a future time, or a deficit in which expenses exceed income.

==Etymology==
A budget (derived from the old [[French language|French]] word meaning purse) is a quantified financial plan for a forthcoming accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A budget is an important concept in [[microeconomics]], which uses a [[budget line]] to illustrate the trade-offs between two or more [[good (economics)|goods]]. In other terms, a budget is an organizational plan stated in monetary terms.

In summary, the purpose of budgeting tools:
# Tools provide a forecast of revenues and expenditures, that is, construct a model of how a business might perform financially if certain strategies, events and plans are carried out.
# Tools enable the actual financial operation of the business to be measured against the forecast.
# Lastly, tools establish the cost constraint for a [[project]], program, or [[Business operations|operation]].

==Corporate==
The budget of a [[company (law)|company]] is often compiled annually, but may not be a finished budget, usually requiring considerable effort, is a plan for the short-term future, typically allows hundreds or even thousands of people in various departments (operations, human resources, IT, etc.) to list their expected revenues and expenses in the final budget.

If the actual figures delivered through the budget period come close to the budget, this suggests that the managers understand their business and have been successfully driving it in the intended direction. On the other hand, if the figures diverge wildly from the budget, this sends an 'out of control' signal, and the share price could suffer. Campaign planners incur two types of cost in any campaign: the first is the cost of human resource necessary to plan and execute the campaign. The second type of expense that campaign planners incur is the hard cost of the campaign itself.

==Event management==
A budget is a fundamental tool for an [[event management|event director]] to predict with a reasonable accuracy whether the event will result in a profit, a loss or will break-even. A budget can also be used as a [[Pricing science|pricing tool]].

There are two basic approaches or philosophies, when it comes to budgeting. One approach is telling you on mathematical models, and the other on people.

The first school of thought believes that financial models, if properly constructed, can be used to predict the future. The focus is on variables, inputs and outputs, drivers and the like. Investments of time and money are devoted to perfecting these models, which are typically held in some type of financial spreadsheet application.

The other school of thought holds that it's not about models, it's about people. No matter how sophisticated models can get, the best information comes from the people in the business. The focus is therefore in engaging the managers in the business more fully in the [[budget process]], and building accountability for the results. The companies that adhere to this approach have their managers develop their own budgets. While many companies would say that they do both, in reality the investment of time and money falls squarely in one approach or the other.

==Government==
{{details|Government budget}}
The budget of a [[government]] is a summary or plan of the intended revenues and expenditures of that government. There are three types of government budget : the operating or current budget, the capital or investment budget, and the cash or cash flow budget.&lt;ref&gt;Cliche, P. (2012). “Budget,” in L. Côté and J.-F. Savard (eds.), Encyclopedic Dictionary of Public Administration, [online], http://www.dictionnaire.enap.ca/Dictionnaire/en/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The budget is prepared by the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] team led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and is presented to Parliament by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on Budget Day. It is customary for the Chancellor to stand on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street with his or her team for the media to get photographic shots of the [[Red box (government)|Despatch Box]], immediately prior to them going to the [[House of Commons]].  Once presented in the House of Commons it is debated and then voted on.  Minor changes may be made however with the budget being written and presented by the party with the majority in the House of Commons (the Government), the [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] will ensure that it is passed as written by the Chancellor. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===United States===
{{main|United States federal budget}}
The federal budget is prepared by the [[Office of Management and Budget]], and submitted to Congress for consideration. Invariably, Congress makes many and substantial changes. Nearly all American states are required to have [[balanced budget]]s, but the federal government is allowed to run deficits. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===[[India]]===
{{main|Union budget of India}}
The budget is prepared by the Budget Division  Department of Economic Affairs of the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] annually. The Finance Minister is the head of the budget making committee. The present Indian Finance minister is [[Arun Jaitley]]. The Budget includes supplementary excess grants and when a proclamation by the [[President of India|President]] as to failure of Constitutional machinery is in operation in relation to a State or a Union Territory, preparation of the Budget of such State.{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

The first budget of India was submitted on 18 February 1869 by James Wilson. James Wilson is known as the father of Indian budget.

===Philippines===
The Philippine budget is considered the most complicated in the world, incorporating multiple approaches in one single budget system: line-item (budget execution), performance (budget accountability), and [[zero-based budgeting]]. The [[Department of Budget and Management]] (DBM) prepares the National Expenditure Program and forwards it to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives to come up with a General Appropriations Bill (GAB). The GAB will go through budget deliberations and voting; the same process occurs when the GAB is transmitted to the [[Philippine Senate]].

After both houses of Congress approves the GAB, the President signs the bill into a General Appropriations Act (GAA); also, the President may opt to veto the GAB and have it returned to the legislative branch or leave the bill unsigned for 30 days and lapse into law. There are two types of budget bill veto: the [[line-item veto]] and the veto of the whole budget. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

==Personal or family==
{{details|Personal budget}}
A personal budget or home budget is a [[finance plan]] that allocates future personal [[income]] towards [[expense]]s, [[savings]] and [[debt]] repayment. Past spending and [[consumer debt|personal debt]] are considered when creating a personal budget. There are several methods and tools available for creating, using and adjusting a personal budget. For example, jobs are an income source, while bills and rent payments are expenses.    A third category (other than income and expenses) may be assets (such as property, investments or other savings or value) representing a potential reserve for funds in case of budget shortfalls.

There are many informational sites and software available for use in personal and family problems.

==Types==
* '''Sales budget''' – an estimate of future sales, often broken down into both units. It is used to create company and sales goals.
* '''[[Production budget]]''' - an estimate of the number of units that must be manufactured to meet the sales goals. The production budget also estimates the various costs involved with manufacturing those units, including labor and material. Created by product oriented companies.
* '''[[Capital budget]]''' - used to determine whether an organization's long-term investments such as new machinery, replacement machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth pursuing.
* '''Cash flow/cash budget''' – a prediction of future cash receipts and expenditures for a particular time period. It usually covers a period in the short-term future. The cash flow budget helps the business to determine when income will be sufficient to cover expenses and when the company will need to seek outside financing.
* '''[[Conditional budgeting]]''' is a [[budget]]ing approach designed for companies with fluctuating income, high [[fixed cost]]s, or income depending on [[sunk costs]], as well as [[Non-profit organization|NPOs]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. 
* '''Marketing budget''' – an estimate of the funds needed for promotion, advertising, and public relations in order to market the product or service.
* '''Project budget''' – a prediction of the costs associated with a particular company project. These costs include labour, materials, and other related expenses. The project budget is often broken down into specific tasks, with task budgets assigned to each. A cost estimate is used to establish a project budget.
* '''Revenue budget''' – consists of revenue receipts of government and the expenditure met from these revenues. Tax revenues are made up of taxes and other duties that the government levies.
* '''Expenditure budget''' – includes spending data items..
* '''Flexibility budget''' - it is established for fixed cost and variable rate is determined per activity measure for variable cost.
* '''Appropriation budget''' - a maximum amount is established for certain expenditure based on management judgment.
*'''Performance budget''' - it is mostly used by organization and ministries involved in the development activities. This process of budget takes into account the end results.
* '''Zero based budget''' - A budget type where every item added to the budget needs approval and no items are carried forward from the prior years budget. This type of budget has a clear advantage when the limited resources are to be allocated carefully and objectively. Zero based budgeting takes more time to create as all pieces of the budget need to be reviewed by management.
*'''Personal budget''' - A budget type focusing on expenses for self or for home, usually involves an income to budget.

The '''capability approach''' (also referred to as the '''capabilities approach''') is an economic theory conceived in the 1980s as an alternative approach to [[welfare economics]].&lt;ref name=Sen1985&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen| title = Commodities and capabilities | publisher = North-Holland Sole distributors for the U.S.A. and Canada, Elsevier Science Pub. Co | location = Amsterdam New York New York, N.Y., U.S.A | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780444877307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] bring together a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to the economics of welfare. The core focus of the capability approach is on what individuals are able to do (i.e., capable of).

== Assessing capability ==

Initially, Sen argued for five components in assessing capability:
# The importance of real freedoms in the assessment of a person's advantage
# Individual differences in the ability to transform resources into valuable activities
# The multi-variate nature of activities giving rise to happiness
# A balance of materialistic and nonmaterialistic factors in evaluating human welfare
# Concern for the distribution of opportunities within society

Subsequently, and in collaboration particularly with political philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], development economist Sudhir Anand and economic theorist James Foster, Sen has helped to make the capabilities approach predominant as a paradigm for policy debate in human development where it inspired the creation of the UN's [[Human Development Index]] (a popular measure of human development, capturing capabilities in health, education, and income). In addition, the approach has been operationalised with a high income country focus by [[Paul Anand]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dowding | first1 = Keith  | last2 = Martin | first2 = Van Hees | last3 = Anand | first3 = Paul | last4 = Hunter | first4 = Graham | last5 = Carter | first5 = Ian | last6 = Guala | first6 = Francesco | author-link1 = Keith Dowding | author-link2 = Martin van Hees | title = The development of capability indicators | journal = Journal of Human Development and Capabilities | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–152 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/14649880802675366 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880802675366 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Anand | first1 = Paul | last2 = Santos | first2 = Cristina | last3 = Smith | first3 = Ron | contribution = The measurement of capabilities | editor-last1 = Basu | editor-first1 = Kaushik | editor-last2 = Kanbur | editor-first2 = Ravi | editor-link1 = Kaushik Basu | editor-link2 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Arguments for a better world: essays in honor of Amartya Sen | volume = 1 | pages = 283–310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199239115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since the creation of the [[Human Development and Capability Association]] in the early 2000s, the approach has been much discussed by political theorists, philosophers, and a range of social scientists, including those with a particular interest in human health.

The approach emphasizes functional capabilities ("substantive freedoms", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities); these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value, instead of [[utility]] ([[happiness]], desire-fulfillment or [[choice]]) or access to resources ([[income]], commodities, [[asset]]s). Poverty is understood as capability-deprivation. It is noteworthy that the emphasis is not only on how humans actually function but also on their having the capability, which is a practical choice, "to achieve outcomes that they value and have reason to value".&lt;ref name = Sen1999_291&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | page = 291 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone could be deprived of such capabilities in many ways, e.g. by ignorance, government oppression, lack of financial resources, or false consciousness.

This approach to human [[well-being]] emphasizes the importance of freedom of choice, individual heterogeneity and the multi-dimensional nature of welfare. In significant respects, the approach is consistent with the handling of choice within conventional [[microeconomics]] [[consumer theory]], although its conceptual foundations enable it to acknowledge the existence of claims, like rights, which normatively dominate utility-based claims (see {{harvnb|Sen|1979}}).

== Key terms ==

=== Functionings ===
In the most basic sense, functionings consist of "beings and doings".&lt;ref name=Sen1992&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Inequality reexamined | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation Clarendon Press Oxford Univ. Press | location = New York Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198289289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, living may be seen as a set of interrelated functionings. Essentially, functionings are the states and activities constitutive of a person's being. Examples of functionings can vary from elementary things, such as being healthy, having a good job, and being safe, to more complex states, such as being happy, having self-respect, and being calm. Moreover, Amartya Sen contends that functionings are crucial to an adequate understanding of the capability approach; capability is conceptualized as a reflection of the freedom to achieve valuable functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

In other words, functionings are the subjects of the capabilities referred to in the approach: what we are capable, want to be capable, or should be capable to be and/or do. Therefore, a person's chosen combination of functionings, what they are and do, is part of their overall capability set — the functionings they were able to do. Yet, functionings can also be conceptualized in a way that signifies an individual's capabilities. [[Eating]], [[starving]], and [[fasting]] would all be considered functionings, but the functioning of fasting differs significantly from that of starving because fasting, unlike starving, involves a choice and is understood as choosing to starve despite the presence of other options.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;  Consequently, an understanding of what constitutes functionings is inherently tied together with an understanding of capabilities, as defined by this approach.

=== Capabilities ===
Capabilities are the alternative combinations of functionings that are feasible for a person to achieve. Formulations of capability have two parts: functionings and opportunity freedom — the substantive freedom to pursue different functioning combinations.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009&gt;{{Citation | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | contribution = The human development and capability approach | editor-last1 = Deneulin | editor-first1 = Séverine | editor-last2 = Shahani | editor-first2 = Lila | editor-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | pages = 22–48 | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844078066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, capabilities denote a person's opportunity and ability to generate valuable outcomes, taking into account relevant personal characteristics and external factors. The important part of this definition is the "freedom to achieve", because if freedom had only [[instrumental value]] (valuable as a means to achieve an end) and no [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] (valuable in and of itself) to a person's well-being, then the value of the capability set as a whole would simply be defined by the value of a person's actual combination of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; Such a definition would not acknowledge the entirety of what a person is capable of doing and their resulting current state due to the nature of the options available to them. Consequently, the capability set outlined by this approach is not merely concerned with achievements; rather, freedom of [[choice]], in and of itself, is of direct importance to a person's [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For example, the difference between [[fasting]] and [[starving]], on person's well-being, is whether the person is choosing not to eat.&lt;ref name=Sen1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the functioning is starving but the capability to obtain an adequate amount of food is the key element in evaluating well-being between individuals in the two states. In sum, having a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is not the same as choosing it; well-being depends on how that lifestyle came to be.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; More formally, while the combination of a person's functionings represents their actual achievements, their capability set represents their opportunity freedom — their freedom to choose between alternative combinations of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

An extension of the capabilities approach was published in 2013 in ''Freedom, Responsibility and Economics of the Person''. This book explores the interconnected concepts of person, responsibility and freedom in economics, moral philosophy and politics.  It tries to reconcile the rationality and morality of individuals. It presents a methodological reflection (phenomenology ''versus'' Kantian thought) with the aim to re-humanise the person, through actions, and through the values and norms that lead to corresponding rights and obligations that must be ordered. The book extends the capabilities approach in a critical form. In particular, it considers freedom in relation to responsibility, that is, the capacity of people to apply moral constraints to themselves. By contrast, Sen's capability approach considers freedom as a purely functional rationality of choice.

=== Agency ===
Amartya Sen defines an agent as someone who acts and brings about change, whose achievement can be evaluated in terms of his or her own [[values]] and goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; This differs from a common use of the term "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]" sometimes used in [[economics]] and [[game theory]] to mean a person acting on someone else's behalf.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; Agency depends on the ability to personally choose the functionings one values, a choice that may not correlate with personal well-being. For example, when a person chooses to engage in [[fasting]], they are exercising their ability to pursue a goal they value, though such a choice may not positively affect [[physical well-being]]. Sen explains that a person as an agent need not be guided by a pursuit of well-being; agency achievement considers a person's success in terms of their pursuit of the whole of their goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For the purposes of the capability approach, agency primarily refers to a person's role as a member of [[society]], with the ability to participate in economic, social, and political actions. Therefore, agency is crucial in assessing one's capabilities and any economic, social, or political barriers to one's achieving substantive freedoms. Concern for agency stresses that [[participation (decision making)|participation]], public debate, [[democracy|democratic]] practice, and [[empowerment]], should be fostered alongside well-being.&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | title = Capability and functionings: definition &amp; justification | journal = HDCA Introductory Briefing Note | publisher = Human Development and Capability Association (HDCA) | date = 2005 | url = https://hd-ca.org/publications/capability-and-functionings-definition-justification | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sabina Alkire|Alkire]] and [[Séverine Deneulin|Deneulin]] pointed out that agency goes together with the expansion of valuable freedoms. That is, in order to be agents of their lives, people need the freedom to be educated, speak in public without fear, express themselves, associate, etc.; conversely, people can establish such an environment by being agents.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; In summary, the agency aspect is important in assessing what a person can do in line with his or her conception of the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crocker | first = David A | contribution = Functioning and capability: the foundations of Sen's and Nussbaum's development ethic | editor-last1 = Nussbaum | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = Glover | editor-first2 = Jonathan | editor-link1 = Martha Nussbaum | editor-link2 = Jonathan Glover | pages = 153–199 | title = Women, culture, and development: a study of human capabilities | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780198289647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nussbaum's central capabilities ==
Nussbaum (2000) frames these basic principles in terms of 10 capabilities, i.e. real opportunities based on personal and social circumstance. She claims that a political order can only be considered as being decent if this order secures at least a threshold level of these 10 capabilities to all inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha|title=Creating Capabilities The Human Development Approach|date=March 2011|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=9780674050549|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum's capabilities approach is centered around the notion of individual human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Nussbaum's contention that the goal of the capabilities approach is to produce capabilities for each and every person, the capabilities below belong to individual persons, rather than to groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674072350|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capabilities approach has been very influential in development policy where it has shaped the evolution of the human development index ([[Human Development Index|HDI]]), has been much discussed in philosophy, and is increasingly influential in a range of social sciences.

More recently, the approach has been criticized for being grounded in the liberal notion of freedom:

{{cquote| This is a fundamentally reductive view of the human condition. Moreover, the emphasis on freedom betrays a profoundly modern orientation. The compound problem is that freedom in Nussbaum’s hands is both given an intrinsic and primary value (a reductive claim), and, at the same time, the list is treated as a contingent negotiated relation in tension with other virtues such as justice, equality and rights. Both propositions cannot hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2018 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Creating Capacities for Human Flourishing: An Alternative Approach to Human Development | title= Cultures of Sustainability and Wellbeing: Theories, Histories, Policies | editor= Paola Spinozzi and Mazzanti Massimiliano | url= https://www.academia.edu/36899596/Creating_Capacities_for_Human_Flourishing_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Human_Development | publisher= Routledge | page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The core capabilities Nussbaum argues should be supported by all democracies are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

## ''Political.'' Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's life; having the right of [[political participation]], protections of free speech and association.
## ''Material.'' Being able to hold [[property]] (both land and movable goods), and having [[property rights]] on an equal basis with others; having the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others; having the freedom from unwarranted search and seizure. In work, being able to work as a human, exercising practical reason and entering into meaningful relationships of mutual recognition with other workers.

Although Nussbaum did not claim her list as definite and unchanging, she strongly advocated for outlining a list of central human capabilities.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Capabilities as fundamental entitlements: Sen and social justice | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 33–59 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/1354570022000077926 | date = 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1354570022000077926 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Sen refuses to supply a specific list of capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sen argues that an exact list and weights would be too difficult to define. For one, it requires specifying the context of use of capabilities, which could vary. Also, Sen argues that part of the richness of the capabilities approach is its insistence on the need for open valuational scrutiny for making social judgments. He is disinclined to in any way devalue the domain of reasoning in the [[public sphere]]. Instead, Sen argues that the task of weighing various capabilities should be left to the ethical and political considerations of each society based on public reasoning.&lt;ref name="Sen2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Sen |first= Amartya |author-link= Amartya Sen |title= Human rights and capabilities |journal= Journal of Human Development |volume= 6 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–166 |publisher= Taylor and Francis |doi= 10.1080/14649880500120491 |date= 2005 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880500120491 |ref= harv |postscript = .}} [http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Human_Rights_and_Capabilities.pdf Pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with concerns raised about Nussbaum's list, Alkire and Black also argue that Nussbaum's methodology "runs counter to an essential thrust of the capabilities approach which has been the attempt to redirect development theory away from a reductive focus on a minimally decent life towards a more holistic account of human well-being for all people."&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a/&gt;

That said, applications to development are discussed in Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2000), and Clark (2002, 2005), and are now numerous to the point where the capabilities approach is widely accepted as a paradigm in development. The programme of work operationalising the capability approach by Anand and colleagues draws heavily on Nussbaum's list as a relatively comprehensive, high-level account of the space in which human well-being or life quality is experienced. This work argues that the subitems on Nussbaum's list are too distinct to be monitored by single question and that a dashboard of some 40-50 indicators is required to inform the development of empirical work.

== Measurement of capabilities ==
The measurement of capabilities was, in the early days, thought to be a particular barrier to the implementation and use of the approach. However, two particular lines of work, in research and policy have sought to show that meaningful indicators of what individuals (and in some cases governments) are able to do can be developed and used to generate a range of insights.

In 1990, the UN Human Development report published the first such exercise which focused on health, education and [[income]] which were equally weighted to generate the [[Human Development Index]]. At the same time, and subsequently, researchers recognizing that these three areas covered only certain elements of life quality have sought to develop more comprehensive measures. A major project in this area has been the 'capabilities measurement project' in which Anand has led teams of philosophers, economists and social scientists to generate that gives a full and direct implement of the approach drawing particular on the key relations and concepts developed in Sen (1985) but also on work to do with the content of the approach. The earliest work in this project developed a set of around 50 capability indicators which were used to develop a picture of quality of life and deprivation in the UK. Subsequently, Anand and colleagues have developed datasets for the USA, UK and Italy in which all the elements of Sen's framework are reflected in data which permits all three key equations, for functionings, experience and capabilities, to be estimated.

In a series of papers, they have shown that both their primary data and some secondary datasets can be used to shed light on the production and distribution of life quality for working age adults, those in retirement, very young children, those vulnerable to domestic violence, [[Human migration|migrants]], excluded traveler communities and the disabled. They use these applications to argue that the capability framework is a particularly good fit for understanding quality of life across the life course and that it provides a relatively universal grammar for understanding the elements of human [[well-being]].

===Monetary vs. non-monetary measures of well-being===
[[Monetary]] and non-monetary measures of well-being are ideal when used to complement each other.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;  Understanding the various aspects of economic development process not only helps address issues of inequality and lags in human development, but also helps to pinpoint where countries lag, which once addressed can further promote well-being and advancement.  As the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) (2006) notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well-being has several dimensions of which monetary factors are only one. They are nevertheless an important one, since richer economies are better placed to create and maintain other well-being-enhancing conditions, such as a [[clean environment]], the likelihood that the average person will have a right to 10 years or more of education, and lead a comparatively [[longevity|long]] and healthy life. Well-being will also be increased by institutions that enable citizens to feel that they control their own lives, and that investment of their time and resources will be rewarded. In turn, this will lead to higher incomes in a [[virtuous circle]].&lt;ref name=OECD2006&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Alternative measures of well-being | editor-last1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | editor-first1 = OECD | editor-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  | title = Economic policy reforms: going for growth 2006 | pages = 129–142 | doi = 10.1787/growth-2006-en  | publisher = OECD | location = Paris | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789264035911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Simon Kuznets]], the developer of GNP, cautioned against using the measure as an indicator of overall welfare, which speaks to the unintended use of output-based measures as indicators of human welfare.

====Critique of output-based measures====
The use of GDP and GNP as an approximation of well-being and development have been critiqued widely, because they are often misused as indicators of well-being and human development when in fact they are only telling about the economic capacity of a country or an average income level when expressed on a per person basis. In particular, [[feminist economics]] and [[environmental economics]] offer a number of critiques. Critics in these fields typically discuss gender inequalities, insufficient representation of environmental costs of productions and general issues of misusing an output-based measure for unintended purposes.  In sum, the conclusion of Capabilities Approach is that people do not just value monetary income, and that development is linked to various indicators of [[life satisfaction]] and hence are important in measuring well-being. Development policies strive to create an environment for people to live long, healthy creative lives.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Martha Nussbaum | title = Creating capabilities | medium = Video | publisher = YouTube | location = Harvard | date = 19 May 2011 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoD-cjduM40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;
 
''Feminist critiques''

Nussbaum highlights some of the problematic assumptions and conclusions of output-based approaches to development.  First, she notes that GNP and GDP do not consider special requirements to help the most vulnerable, such as women.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004&gt;{{Citation | last = Nussbaum  | first = Martha | author-link= Martha Nussbaum | contribution = Promoting women's capabilities | editor-last1 = Benería | editor-first1 = Lourdes | editor-last2 = Bisnath | editor-first2 = Savitri | editor-link1 = Lourdes Benería | title = Global tensions: challenges and opportunities in the world economy | pages = 200–214 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415934411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Nussbaum mentions that output-based approaches ignore the distribution of needs for the varying circumstances of people, for example a pregnant woman needs more resources than a non-pregnant woman or a single man.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt;

Also, output-based measures ignore [[unpaid work]], which includes child rearing and the societal advantages that result from a mother's work.  [[Marilyn Waring]], a political economist and activist for women's rights, elaborates on the example of a mother engaged in child care, domestic care and producing few goods for the informal market, all of which are usually done simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Waring2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Waring | first = Marilyn | author-link = Marilyn Waring | title = Counting for something! Recognising women's contribution to the global economy through alternative accounting systems | journal = Gender &amp; Development, special issue - women reinventing globalisation | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–43 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/741954251 | date = 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/741954251 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities provide economic benefits, but are not valued in national accounting systems; this suggests that the definition of unemployment used in output-based measures is inappropriate.&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt; (See the article on [[Feminist economics#Well-being|Feminist economics, section "Well-being"]]).

''Environmental critiques''

Another critique by Waring is that the output-based measures ignore negative effects of economic growth&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Terre Nash | title = Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics |medium = Motion picture | publisher = National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Studio B  | location = Canada | date = 1995 | url = https://www.nfb.ca/film/whos_counting/ }} See ''[[Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt; and so commodities that lower social welfare, such as nuclear weapons, and oil extraction which causes spills, are considered a good input. The "anti-bads" or the defensive expenditures to fight "bads" are not counted as a deduction in accounting systems (p.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanton2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Elizabeth A|title=The human development index: a history|date=February 2007|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute - PERI, University of Massachusetts Amherst|location=Massachusetts|id=Working paper no. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, natural resources are treated as limitless and negative outputs such as pollution and associated health risks, are not deducted from the measures.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

''Technical and misinterpretation critiques''

When GNP and GDP were developed, their intended use was not for measuring human well-being; the intended use was as an indicator of economic growth, and that does not necessarily translate into human well-being.&lt;ref name=OECD2006/&gt; Kuznets has often made this point, in his words, "distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | first = OECD | author-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | title = The well-being of nations: the role of human and social capital | page = 9 | publisher = Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | location = Paris | year = 2001  | website = www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/40/33703702.pdf | isbn = 9789264185890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points out that GNP and GDP omit income distribution and the opportunity or ability to turn resources into activities (this critique stems directly from Capabilities Approach).&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt; Kuznets terms this as a problem of "obtaining an unduplicated total of all output", (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kuznets | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Kuznets | title = Measurement of economic growth | journal = The Journal of Economic History | volume = 7 | issue = s1 | pages = 10–34 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0022050700065190 | date = January 1947 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022050700065190 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that people are only seen as consumers and not as potential producers, hence any products purchased by an individual are not seen as "being consumed in the productive process of turning out other goods" (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt;

These accounting measures also fail to capture all forms of work and only focus on "engagement in work 'for pay or profit{{'"}}, (p.&amp;nbsp;133)&lt;ref name=Beneria2003&gt;{{Citation | last = Benería  | first = Lourdes  | author-link = Lourdes Benería | contribution = Paid and unpaid labor: meanings and debates | editor-last = Benería | editor-first = Lourdes | editor-link = Lourdes Benería | title = Gender, development, and globalization: economics as if all people mattered | pages = 131–160 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415927079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving out contributions to a society and economy, like volunteer work and subsistence farming. Kuznets provides the example of the process by which farmers devote time and energy to bringing virgin land into cultivation.&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt; Furthermore, GNP and GDP only account for monetary exchanges, and place no value on some important intangibles such as leisure time.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

===Shift to alternative measures===
Capabilities Approach has been highly influential thus far in human development theories and valuational methods of capturing capabilities,&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125/&gt; the theory has led to the creation of the HDI, IHDI and GII and their uses among international organizations such as the United Nations and others. In companies, capabilities are included in [[Key Development Indicator]]s, or KDIs as measures of development, including employee development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aubrey|first1=Bob|title=The Measure of Man: Leading Human Development|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 in the [[Human Development Report]] (HDR)commissioned by the UNDP set out to create a distribution-sensitive development measure.&lt;ref name="Reforming"&gt;{{Cite journal |  last1= Klasen |first1= Stephan | last2 = Schüler | first2 = Dana | title = Reforming the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure: implementing some specific proposals | journal = Feminist Economics| volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was created to rival the more traditional metrics of GDP and GNP, which had previously been used to measure level of development in a given country, but which did not contain provisions for terms of distribution.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klasen |first=Stephan |title= UNDP's gender-related measures: some conceptual problems and possible solutions |journal=Journal of Human Development - special issue, Revisiting the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=243–274 |doi=10.1080/14649880600768595  |date=2006 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880600768595 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting measure was entitled the Human Development Index, created by Mahbub ul Haq in collaboration with Sen and others.  The purpose was to create an indicator of human development, especially one that would provide a general assessment and critique of global human development to shed light on persistent inequality, poverty and other capability deprivations despite high levels of GDP growth.&lt;ref name=Sen2005/&gt;

Currently the HDI continues to be used in the Human Development Report in addition to many other measures (based on theoretical perspectives of Capabilities) that have been developed and used by the United Nations.  Among these indices are the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), introduced in 1995, and the more recent [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII) and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), both adopted in 2010.

===Capabilities-based indices===
The following are a few of the major indices that were created based on the theoretical grounds of Capabilities Approach.

====Human development index====

The [[Human Development Index]] takes into consideration a number of development and well-being factors that are not taken into account in the calculation of GDP and GNP. The Human Development Index is calculated using the indicators of life expectancy, adult literacy, school enrollment, and logarithmic transformations of per-capita income.&lt;ref name=Reforming/&gt; Moreover, it is noted that the HDI "is a weighted average of income adjusted for distributions and purchasing power, life expectancy, literacy and health" (p.&amp;nbsp;16)&lt;ref name=Schischka2002&gt;{{Citation | last = Schischka | first = John | chapter = The capabilities approach as a metric for economic development: an application in Nepal | title = Conference proceedings - promoting women's capabilities, examining Nussbaum's capabilities approach | place = von Hügel Institute, St Edmund's College, Cambridge | publisher = The Pennsylvania State University CiteSeerX Archives | date = 9–10 September 2002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.197.7649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDI is calculated for individual countries with a value between 0 and 1 and is "interpreted...as the ultimate development that has been attained by that nation" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name=Schischka2002/&gt; Currently, the 2011 Human Development Report also includes the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index which accounts for exactly the same things that the HDI considers however the IHDI has all three dimensions (long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living) adjusted for inequalities in the distribution of each dimension across the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Statistical annex: technical notes - technical note 2: calculating the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2011: sustainability and equity: a better future for all | page = 169 | publisher = United Nations Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York Basingstoke | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780230363311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender-related development index====

The [[Gender-related Development Index]] is defined as a "distribution-sensitive measure that accounts for the human development impact of existing gender gaps in the three components of the HDI" (p.&amp;nbsp;243).&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; In this way, the GDI accounts for shortcomings in the HDI in terms of gender, because it re-evaluates a country's score in the three areas of the HDI based on perceived gender gaps, and penalizes the score of the country if, indeed, large gender disparities in those areas exist. This index is used in unison with the HDI and therefore also captures the elements of capabilities that the HDI holds. In addition, it considers women's capabilities which has been a focus in much of Sen's and Nussbaum's work (to list a few: Nussbaum, 2004a; Nussbaum, 2004b; Sen, 2001; Sen, 1990.)

====Gender empowerment measure====

The [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) is considerably more specialized than the GDI. The GEM focuses particularly on the relative empowerment of women in a given country.&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; The empowerment of women is measured by evaluating women's employment in high-ranking economic positions, seats in parliament, and share of household income. Notably this measurement captures more of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities, such as, Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment.

====Gender inequality index====

In the 2013 Human Development Report the Gender Inequality Index, which was introduced in 2011, continues to adjust the GDI and the GEM. This composite measurement uses three dimensions: [[reproductive health]], empowerment, and labor force participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Chapter 1: The state of human development (progress of nations, equity and human development): Gender and women's status | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2013: the rise of the South: human progress in a diverse world | page = 31 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2013 | isbn = 9789211263404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When constructing the index the following criteria were key: conceptual relevance to definitions of human development and theory; Non-ambiguity so that the index is easily interpreted; Reliability of data that is standardized and collected/processed by a trustworthy organization; No redundancy found in other indicators; and lastly Power of discrimination, where distribution is well distinguished among countries and there is no "bunching" among top and bottom countries (p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Gaye | first1 = Amie | last2 = Klugman | first2 = Jeni | last3 = Kovacevic | first3 = Milorad | last4 = Twigg | first4 = Sarah | last5 = Zambrano | first5 = Eduardo| author-link2 = Jeni Klugman | contribution = 3: Introducing the gender inequality index - 3.1: Selection of dimensions and indicators | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development research paper 2010/46 - Measuring key disparities in human development: the gender inequality index | pages = 9–10 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This index also captures some of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities (Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment).

====Other measures====

In 1997, the UNDP introduced the Human Poverty Index  (HPI), which is aimed at measuring poverty in both industrialized and developing countries. The HPI is a "nonincome-based" measure of poverty (p.&amp;nbsp;100) which focuses on "human outcomes in terms of choices and opportunities that a person faces" (p.&amp;nbsp;99).&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fukuda-Parr | first1 = Sakiko | author-link = Sakiko Fukuda-Parr | title = What does feminization of poverty mean? It isn't just lack of income | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–103 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/135457099337996 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135457099337996 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this index, [[Sakiko Fukuda-Parr]]—a development economist and past Director of The Human Development Report Office—differentiates between income poverty and human poverty.  Human poverty can be interpreted as deprivations to lead a long healthy and creative life with a decent standard of living.&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999/&gt;

=== Economic evaluation in health care ===
The capability approach is being developed and increasingly applied in [[health economics]], for use in [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]. It is seen as an alternative to existing preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (for example the [[EQ-5D]]) that focus on functioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Welfarism, extra-welfarism and capability: The spread of ideas in health economics|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795360800333X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2008-10-01|pages = 1190–1198|volume = 67|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.06.027|first = Joanna|last = Coast|first2 = Richard D.|last2 = Smith|first3 = Paula|last3 = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Choice of Outcome Measure in an Economic Evaluation: A Potential Role for the Capability Approach|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|journal = PharmacoEconomics|date = 2015-04-11|issn = 1170-7690|pages = 849–855|volume = 33|issue = 8|doi = 10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|language = en|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be applied within the framework of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = QALYs and the capability approach|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.975/abstract|journal = Health Economics|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1099-1050|pages = 817–829|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1002/hec.975|language = en|first = Richard|last = Cookson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of measures have been created for use in particular contexts such as older people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing quality of life among British older people using the ICEPOP CAPability (ICECAP-O) measure|journal = Applied Health Economics and Health Policy|date = 2011-09-01|issn = 1179-1896|pmid = 21875162|pages = 317–329|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.2165/11594150-000000000-00000|first = Terry N.|last = Flynn|first2 = Phil|last2 = Chan|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Coast|first4 = Tim J.|last4 = Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; public health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Operationalising the capability approach as an outcome measure in public health: The development of the OCAP-18|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361530054X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 68–81|volume = 142|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.002|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly|first2 = Karen|last2 = Lorimer|first3 = Elisabeth A.

===Alternative measures of well-being===

As noted above, to a great extent, Nussbaum's Central Human Capabilities address issues of equality, political freedom, creativity and the right to the self, as do the various indices that are based on capabilities.  It is evident that these measures are very subjective, but this fact is in the essence of defining quality of life according to Nussbaum and Sen. Nussbaum refers to Sen in saying that, although measures of well-being may be problematic in comparative, quantifiable models due to their subjective matter, the protection of and commitment to human development are too important of matters to be left on the sidelines of economic progress.  Well-being and quality of life are too important to be left without intentional focus towards political change.&lt;ref name= Nussbaum2003/&gt;

Measures such as the HDI, GDI, GEM, GII, IHDI and the like are crucial in targeting issues of well-being and indicators of quality of life. Anand, et al. (2009) can be summarized as demonstrating that it is possible to measure capabilities within the conventions applied to standard household survey design, contrary to earlier doubts about the ability to operationalise the capabilities approach.

== Contrast with other approaches ==

===Utility-based or subjective approaches ===
Much of conventional [[welfare economics]] today is grounded in a [[utilitarian]] approach according to the classical Benthamite form of [[utilitarianism]], in which the most desirable action is the one that best increases peoples' psychological [[happiness]] or satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; The "[[utility]]" of a person stands for some measure of his or her [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]]. Some merits associated with this approach to measuring well-being are that it recognizes the importance of taking account of the results of social arrangements in judging them and the need to pay attention to the well-being of the people involved when judging social arrangements and their results.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;  Amartya Sen, however, argues this view has three main deficiencies: distributional indifference, neglect of [[rights]], [[freedoms]] and other non-utility concerns, and adaptation and mental conditioning.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

Distributional indifference refers to a utilitarian indifference between different the distributions of utility, so long as the sum total is the same (note that the utilitarian is indifferent to the distribution of happiness, not income or wealth - the utilitarian approach would generally prefer, all else being equal, more materially equal societies assuming [[diminishing marginal utility]]). Sen argues that we may "want to pay attention not just to "aggregate" magnitudes, but also to extents of inequalities in happiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Development as freedom|date=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0385720274|page=62|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen also argues that while the [[utilitarian]] approach attaches no [[intrinsic value (ethics)]] to claims of rights and freedoms, some people value these things independently of their contribution to utility.

Lastly, Amartya Sen makes the argument that the [[utilitarian]] view of individual well-being can be easily swayed by mental conditioning and peoples' happiness adapting to [[oppressive]] situations. The [[utility calculus]] can essentially be unfair to those who have come to terms with their deprivation as a means for survival, adjusting their desires and expectations. The capability approach, on the other hand, doesn't fall victim to these same criticisms because it acknowledges inequalities by focusing on equalizing people's capabilities, not happiness, it stresses the intrinsic importance of rights and freedoms when evaluating well-being, and it avoids overlooking deprivation  by focusing on capabilities and opportunities, not state of mind.

=== Resource-based approaches ===
Another common approach in conventional economics, in [[economic policy]] and judging development, has traditionally been to focus on [[income]] and [[resources]]. These sorts of approaches to development focus on increasing resources, such as assets, property rights, or basic needs.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009 /&gt; However, measuring resources is fundamentally different from measuring functionings, such as the case in which people don't have the capability to use their resources in the means they see fit. Arguably, the main difficulty in a resource- or income-based approach to well-being lies in personal heterogeneities, namely the diversity of human beings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

Different amounts of income are needed for different individuals to enjoy similar capabilities, such as an individual with severe [[disabilities]] whose treatment to ensure the fulfillment of basic capabilities may require dramatically more income compared to an able-bodied person. All sorts of differences, such as differences in age, gender, talents, etc. can make two people have extremely divergent opportunities of [[quality of life]], even when equipped with exactly the same commodities. Additionally, other contingent circumstances which affect what an individual can make of a given set of resources include environmental diversities (in geographic sense), variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives, and distribution within the family.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

The capability approach, however, seeks to consider all such circumstances when evaluating people's actual capabilities. Furthermore, there are things people value other than increased resources. In some cases, maximizing resources may even be objectionable. As was recognized in the 1990 [[Human Development Report]], the basic objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy, and creative lives. This end is often lost in the immediate concern with the accumulation of commodities and financial wealth that are only a means to expansion of capabilities. Overall, though resources and income have a profound effect on what we can or cannot do, the capability approach recognizes that they are not the only things to be considered when judging well-being, switching the focus from a means to a good life to the freedom to achieve actual improvements in lives, which one has reason to value.

[[Image:Christaller's central place theory animation.gif|thumb|right]]
'''Central place theory''' is a [[geography|geographical]] [[theory]] that seeks to explain the number, size and location of [[human settlement]]s in a [[residential system]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was created by the [[Germany|German]] geographer [[Walter Christaller]], who asserted that settlements simply functioned as 'central places' providing services to surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Building the Theory ==
To develop the theory, Christaller made the following simplifying assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;http://uprav.ff.cuni.cz/?q=system/files/christaller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All areas have:
* an unbounded [[isotropic]] (all flat), homogeneous, limitless surface ([[abstract space]])
* an evenly distributed population
* all settlements are equidistant and exist in a triangular lattice pattern
* evenly distributed resources
* distance decay mechanism
* perfect competition and all sellers are economic people maximizing their profits
* consumers are of the same income level and same shopping behaviour
* all [[consumer]]s have a similar purchasing power and demand for goods and services
* Consumers visit the nearest central places that provide the function which they demand. They minimize the distance to be travelled
* no provider of goods or services is able to earn excess profit (each supplier has a monopoly over a hinterland)
Therefore, the trade areas of these central places who provide a particular good or service must all be of equal size
* there is only one type of transport and this would be equally easy in all directions
* transport cost is proportional to distance traveled in example, the longer the distance traveled, the higher the transport cost()

The theory then relied on two concepts: ''threshold'' and ''range''. 
*[[Threshold population|Threshold]] is the minimum market (population or income) needed to bring about the selling of a particular good or service.
*Range is the maximum distance consumers are prepared to travel to acquire goods - at some point the cost or inconvenience will outweigh the need for the good.

The result of these consumer preferences is that a system of centers of various sizes will emerge. Each center will supply particular types of goods forming levels of hierarchy.  In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.

#The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.
#The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.
#As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .
#As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.

The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable,Heidi valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them.

At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the pyramid are centres selling high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.

==Predictions==
He deduced that settlements would tend to form in a triangular/hexagonal lattice, as it is the most efficient pattern to serve areas without any overlap.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

In the orderly arrangement of an urban hierarchy, seven different principal orders of settlement have been identified by Christaller, providing different groups of goods and services. Settlement are regularly spaced - equidistant spacing between same order centers, with larger centers farther apart than smaller centers. Settlements have hexagonal market areas, and are most efficient in number and functions.

The different layouts predicted by Christaller have ''K''-values which show how much the Sphere of Influence of the central places takes in &amp;mdash; the central place itself counts as 1 and each portion of a satellite counts as its portion:

=== ''K'' = 3 Marketing principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 3 Principle]]
According to the marketing principle ''K'' = 3, the market area of a higher-order place(node) occupies 1/3rd of the market area of each of the consecutive lower size place(node) which lies on its neighbor; the lower size nodes (6 in numbers and 2nd larger circles) are located at the corner of a largest hexagon around low value the high-order settlement.  Each high-order settlement gets 1/3rd of each satellite settlement (which are 6 in total), thus ''K'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;times;1/3 = 3.

However, although in this ''K'' = 3 marketing network the distance traveled is minimized, the transport network is not the

=== ''K'' = 4 Transport/Traffic principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 4 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 4 transport principle, the market area of a higher-order place includes a half of the market area of each of the six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of central places which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum central places possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center.The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting central places at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order,as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.

=== ''K'' = 7 Administrative principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 3.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 7 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 7 administrative principle (or political-social principle), settlements are nested according to sevens. The market areas of the smaller settlements are completely enclosed within the market area of the larger settlement.  Since tributary areas cannot be split administratively, they must be allocated exclusively to a single higher-order place. Efficient administration is the control principle in this hierarchy.

==Evaluation==

The validity of the place theory may vary with local factors, such as climate, topography, history of development, technological improvement and personal preference of consumers and suppliers. However, it is still possible to discern Christaller patterns in most distributions of urban centres, even though these patterns will often be distorted by the terrain or imperfect because of suboptimal (with regard to the optimal distribution of centres) historical development decisions.

Economic status of consumers in an area is also important. Consumers of higher economic status tend to be more mobile and therefore bypass centers providing only lower order goods. The application of central place theory must be tempered by an awareness of such factors when planning shopping center space location.

Purchasing power and density affect the spacing of centers and hierarchical arrangements. Sufficient densities will allow, for example, a grocery store, a lower order function, to survive in an isolated location.

Factors shaping the extent of market areas: 
*  [[Land use]]: industrial areas can provide little in the way of a consuming population
*  Poor [[accessibility]]: this can limit the extent of a center's market area
* [[Competition]]: this limits the extent of market areas in all directions
* [[Technology]]: high mobility afforded by the automobile allows overlapping of market areas

Market area studies provide another technique for using central place theory as a retail location planning tool. The hierarchy of shopping centers has been widely used within the planning of "[[new town]]s". In this new town, the hierarchy of business centers is evident. One main [[shopping center]] provides mostly [[Durable good|durable goods]] (higher order); district and local shopping centers supply, increasingly, convenience (lower order) goods. These centers provided for in the new town plan are not free from outside competition. The impacts of surrounding existing centers on the new town centers cannot be ignored.

==Examples==
The newly reclaimed [[polders]] of the [[Netherlands]] provide an isotropic plane on which settlements have developed and in certain areas 6 small towns can be seen surrounding a larger town, especially in the Noord-Oostpolder and Flevoland.
The [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] in the UK also provide a large expanse of flat land with no natural barriers to settlement development.  [[Cambridge]] is a good example of a K=4 Transport Model Central Place, although it is surrounded by 7, rather than 6, settlements.  Each satellite is 10–15 miles from Cambridge and each lies on a major road leading out of Cambridge:
* [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] - A10 north
* [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] - A1303 (now bypassed by A14/A11) northeast
* [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]] - A1307 southeast
* [[Saffron Walden]] - A1301 south
* [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] - A10 southwest
* [[St Neots]] - A428 west
* [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] - A14 northwest

As all of the satellite settlements are on transport links, this is a good example of a K=4 CPT model (although in this case it is K=4.5 due to 7 rather than 6 settlements).

Another example of the use of CPT was in the delineation of Medical Care Regions in California.  A hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary care cities was described,
and the population size and income needed to support each medical care specialty in California determined.

== Criticism ==
The Central Place Theory has been criticized for being static; it does not incorporate the temporal aspect in the development of central places. Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.

== Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT ==
Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed ("medieval") towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into an hierarchical ("industrial") city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical ("postindustrial") city system.
This evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thunen "isolated states"; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a Löschian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to [[Christopher Alexander]]'s "tree" city, while (c) is similar to his "lattice" system (following his dictum "the city is not a tree").

==The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations==
According to Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city.  Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the '''number of kinds of services''' offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers.  In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.

Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities "emerge".  In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid.  In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water.  Older towns were founded a day's horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.

In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care.  Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)

For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.

Her work is important for the study of physician location—where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.

The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities.  Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the Traffic Principle (See K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them—the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals.  They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper.  Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive.  In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.

== Making Central Place Theory operational ==
CPT is often criticized as being "unrealistic". However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems.  An important issue is that Christaller's original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT "operational", that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:

1. Closure problem. Christaller's original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be "contained". Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.

2. Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.

3. Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply "airline" distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified.  Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.

=== Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models ===
{{Details|Spatial Interaction Models}}
It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.

Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.

Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles. What is central place?

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm Problems of War and Strategy]''. 1938. (''See also: [[q:Mao Zedong|Wikiquote: Mao Zedong]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

A subordinate of the ''civilian'' [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the Secretary of the Navy is the ''civilian'' Head of the [[Department of the Navy]], which includes the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].]]
Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">The '''Columbia School of Linguistics''' is a group of linguists with a radically functional and empirical conception of language.  According to their school of thought, the main function of language is communication.  Columbia School linguistic analyses typically are based on observable data, such as corpora (texts or recorded speech), not on introspective ad hoc sentence examples.  Rather than a single theory of language, the Columbia School is set of orientations in which scholars analyze actual speech acts in an attempt to explain why they take the forms they do.  This was the methodology of its founder, the late [[William Diver]], who taught linguistics at Columbia University until his retirement in 1989.

== Orientations ==

On the one hand, this methodology is more modest in its goals than most other schools.  On the other hand, the results produced are more reliable, because they are based on objective data, rather than on [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] or philosophical entities{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}.  The assumption is that modest goals are more appropriate for a linguistic science still in its infancy, a science that hasn’t yet freed itself entirely from traditional philological parts of speech, self-standing sentence examples, and logico-philosophical entities such as subject and predicate{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}. Conclusions about how the mind functions, based on the structure of language, should wait until a new, more reliable linguistics emerges, as did astronomy from its origins in astrology{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective? The author has not even cited someone who claimed this as a fundamental principle of the Columbia school.|date=May 2018}}.

A useful illustration of the differences between the Columbia School of Linguistics (CSL) and other linguistic approaches is the way each regards the field of mathematics.  Rather than considering human language to be itself a kind of logic or mathematics, CSL uses mathematics as a tool to analyze and draw conclusions about languages.  Instead of trying to produce rules to generate all possible “grammatical” sentences, CSL scholars count and compare numbers of occurrences of various phenomena and then apply statistical criteria to draw conclusions about the reasons for this usage.  These conclusions, although not earth-shattering,  are based on the CSL orientations of communication, physiology or psychology. CSL researchers typically search the gray areas for an explanation of why one form appears more often than another, and are not satisfied with a black-and-white mapping of the frontiers of grammaticality.  Whereas most linguists talk of '''constraints''' and combinations of entities that are not permitted, CSL linguists discuss the '''choices''' that speakers of language have and how they make use of those choices.

CSL’s basic unit of language is the morpheme, the smallest meaningful unit of language.  This is the [[linguistic sign]], the unit shared by all other subdisciplines of [[semiotics]].  By taking the sign as the basic unit—as opposed to the sentence—CSL linguists can reasonably compare either spoken or sign language to all other forms of communication through signs, from ideograms to musical notation to bee dancing.  It is not a goal of CSL to search for entities of human language that distinguish it from other forms of animal communication.  As with all posited entities, CSL will accept them after they have been shown to have a function.

== Semantics ==

One radical approach of CSL is in its treatment of meaning.  Rather than assuming that there exist semantic universals—much less that we know what they are—CSL assumes that every linguistic sign has a meaning different from all other signs in any language.  Although meanings may be similar, they are never exactly the same. And until it can be objectively shown that a particular sign has multiple meanings, the assumption is that it has only one meaning (elsewhere known as a [[Gesamtbedeutung]]), capable of carrying diverse messages. This derives from Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralist perspective on language, whose perspective relies heavily on the dictum "one form - one meaning". For example, many linguists believe that the word ''with'' has several meanings, such as ''instrumental'': “cut with a knife,” ''adversarial'': “struggle with your enemies”, and even ''partitive'': “split with the organization,” among others.   However, CSL linguists observe that what varies among these uses is not the meaning of ''with'' but the message of the phrase, due to the accompanying verbs and nouns.   ''Struggle'' undoubtedly contributes to the adversarial message, but so does the word ''enemies'';  “struggle with your comrades” would likely eliminate the adversarial relationship.  The little word ''with'' contributes the same weak meaning (something like: “at some time accompanied by”) throughout.   Not only do words in the same sentence affect the message conveyed by ''with'', but the surrounding context and the non-linguistic circumstances do so as well.   In “don’t struggle with him,” the sense is radically affected by the antecedent of ''him,'' whether ''him'' was identified in the previous sentence or whether the speaker is pointing to someone likely to be the listener’s comrade or enemy.

== Syntax ==

Another distinguishing characteristic of the Columbia school is its approach to syntax.  CSL does not attempt to create an algorithm that can generate all possible sentences, because there is no clear dividing line between “grammatical” and “ungrammatical” sentences.   Many apparently ungrammatical sentences can find a useful application, given the proper context.

== Phonology ==

CSL differs from other schools in the other major aspect of language, phonology, as well.  Here again, CSL does not posit entities, such as binary features, unless they can be shown to have a function.  There is nothing in information theory that requires every message to consist ultimately of a binary code.   Any linguistic message can be represented by a binary code, just as our decimal number system can be represented binarily. Therefore, the bit can be used as convenient but arbitrary measure of information for speech or for numerical information. But nobody seriously proposes that people fundamentally use binary digits in counting, as some linguists do for speech.

Unlike most other schools, CSL concentrates on articulation, rather than sound, as its object of study (but see also [[articulatory phonology]]).  For example, CSL attributes the relative rarity in most languages of words beginning with /g/ to its relative difficulty of articulation, not to auditory causes.  In the production of a (voiced) /g/, air must pass through the vocal cords while the back of the tongue stops up the vocal tract, blocking that air.  Since the resulting chamber of air for /g/ is smaller than for /b/ or /d/, there is less time for air to build up, making it harder to produce a vocal vibration when starting to speak.  Thus, through its physiological theoretical orientation, CSL gives an articulatory explanation of the low frequency of initial /g/ in human language.  CSL does not neglect sound as the means through which spoken language is transmitted and whose perceptible differences serve to distinguish linguistic signs.  However, it considers [[articulatory gestures]], not binary acoustic features, to be the physical units of which any utterance is made up.

== Summary ==

The Columbia School of Linguistics traces its origins through [[André Martinet]] and others back to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the founder of modern linguistics.  Like Saussure, CSL considers a language to be a kind of system “où tout se tient” (where everything depends on or influences everything else).  But CSL differs from Saussure and his followers in its interest in substance as well as in form.   Saussure emphatically denied the relevance of the physical media (vocal tract, sound) through which language functions, claiming that language consists of nothing but differences, which are phonetically achieved through the use of physical media.  But CSL linguists make a practice of explaining the arrangement of various forms (/g/, red barn vs. barn red) through their related substances (air chambers, difference in meaning).  CSL researchers set as their goal what other linguists postulate—but do not explain how—children do as they acquire their first language, that is, they analyze the undifferentiated mass of linguistic input actually produced by people.   Rather than marveling at the infinitude of possible sentences that could be produced by an algorithm, CSL linguists wonder at the remarkable skill that humans have in employing a limited number of physical resources and meanings to produce a myriad of messages appropriate for a myriad of situations.

==Nominal return==
Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the price of a security at time ''t'', including any cash dividends or [[interest]], and let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; be its price at ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Let ''RS''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the simple rate of return on the security from ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 to ''t''.  Then

: &lt;math&gt; 1 + RS_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''continuously compounded rate of return''' or '''instantaneous  rate of return''' ''RC&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' obtained during that period is

: &lt;math&gt; RC_{t}=\ln\left (\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\right ).&lt;/math&gt;

If this instantaneous return is received continuously for one period, then the initial value ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t-1''&lt;/sub&gt; will grow to &lt;math&gt;P_t = P_{t-1} \cdot e^{RC_t}&lt;/math&gt;  during that period.  See also [[Compound interest|continuous compounding]].

Since this analysis did not adjust for the effects of [[inflation]] on the purchasing power of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''RS'' and ''RC'' are referred to as [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal rates of return]].

==Real return==
Let &lt;math&gt; \pi _ t&lt;/math&gt; be the purchasing power of a dollar at time ''t'' (the number of bundles of consumption that can be purchased for $1).  Then &lt;math&gt;\pi_t = 1/(PL_t)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''PL''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the price level at ''t'' (the dollar price of a bundle of consumption goods). The simple inflation rate ''IS''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''t'' &amp;ndash;1 to ''t'' is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {PL_t}{PL_{t-1}} - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, continuing the above nominal example, the final value of the investment expressed in real terms is

:&lt;math&gt;P_t^{real} = P_t \cdot \frac{PL_{t-1}}{PL_t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the continuously compounded real rate of return &lt;math&gt;RC^{real}&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; RC_{t}^{real}=\ln\left (\frac{P_{t}^{real}}{P_{t-1}}\right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The continuously compounded real rate of return is just the continuously compounded nominal rate of return minus the continuously compounded inflation rate.

{{Anthropology |concepts}}

'''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[Applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term ''development'' refers to the social action made by different agents (e.g. [[institution]]s, [[business]]es, [[State (polity)|states]], or independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the [[Economy|economic]], technical, political, or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in [[Poverty|impoverished]], formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer [[Western culture|Western]] projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most [[Marginalization|marginalized]], and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the [[anthropology of development]] (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With researches on the field, the anthropologist can describe, analyze, and understand the different actions of development that took and take place in a given place. The various impacts on the local population, environment, society, and economy are to be examined.

==History==

In 1971, Glynn Cochrane proposed development anthropology as a new field for practitioners interested in a career outside academia.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Development Anthropology'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, (ed.) ''What can we do for each other, An Interdisciplinary Approach to Development Anthropology'', (Amsterdam: Grüner, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the growing complexity of development assistance, Cochrane suggested that graduates needed to prepare themselves to work in interdisciplinary settings.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, "Policy Studies and Anthropology", in ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 21, No., 4, August, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Cochrane was invited by the [[World Bank]] to make recommendations for the use of anthropology, and his report&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Use of Anthropology in Project Operations of the World Bank Group'', (World Bank/IMF, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; (which stressed the need for the systematic treatment of social issues) laid a foundation for future use of the discipline in the [[World Bank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goodlund, ''Social and Environmental Assessment to Promote Sustainability, an Informal View from the World Bank'', (Glasgow: International Association for Impact Assessment, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Around ninety anthropologists are now employed by the World Bank Group in various roles.

In 1974, Bob Berg—of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID)—and Cochrane worked together, and, as a result, USAID introduced "social soundness analysis" as a project preparation requirement. This innovation led to the employment of more than seventy anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hoben, "Anthropologists and Development", in ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 11: 349-375 (Volume publication date October 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Cultural Appraisal of Development Projects'', (New York: Praeger, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Social soundness analysis has now been in USAID use for over forty years. USAID ran an in-house development studies course in the 1970s, through which several hundred field personnel eventually passed. In addition to anthropology, the course covered development [[economics]], regional and national planning, and institution building.

In the late 1970s, Thayer Scudder, Michael Horowitz,  and David Brokensha established an Institute for Development Anthropology at the [[State University of New York]] at Binghamton. This institute has played an influential role in the continuing expansion of this branch of the discipline.

By the 1980s and 1990s, development anthropology began to be more widely used in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Festival Elephants and the Myth of Global Poverty'', (New York: Pearson, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate social responsibility and issues ranging from resettlement and [[human rights]] to [[micro-enterprise]] are now routinely addressed by systematic social assessment as an integral part of investment appraisal.

==Development criticism==
{{see also|Development criticism}}

Criticism of Western development became an important goal in the late 1980s, after the wake of severe economic crisis brought disease, poverty, and [[starvation]] to countries and sectors that were the focus of large Western [[structural adjustment]] development projects throughout [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and other parts of the former colonial world. Despite the failure of many of these development projects, and some 40 years of post [[World War II]] funding from the US and Europe, scholars know{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} that development has been the key way that Western post-industrialized countries intervene in non-Western society. Development criticism seeks to discover why, given the funds and best intentions of volunteers and policy makers, do the majority of development projects continue to fail to (1) redistribute economic power and resources in a way that helps the poorest sectors of society, and (2) to create economic growth that is sustainable in the country.

Anthropologists who study development projects themselves have criticized the fundamental structure of Western development projects coming from such institutions as USAID and bilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Because they are often working from the perspective of the objects of development in the non-Western world, rather than from within the aid institutions, anthropologists encountering such projects have a unique perspective from which to see the problems. Anthropologists write with concern about the ways that non-Western objects of aid have been left out of the widespread drive to develop after World War II, especially in the ways that such projects limit solutions to poverty in the form of narrow Western [[Capitalism|capitalist]] models that promote exploitation and the destruction of household farms, or, more suspiciously, naturalise inequality between Western post-industrialized countries and former colonial subjects.

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers; however, they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that [[sustainable development]] requires at the very least more involvement of the people who the project aims to target in the project's creation, its management, and its decision-making processes.

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]]'s seminal book ''[[Encountering Development]]'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples and enacted an [[Orientalism]] (see [[Edward Said]]). Escobar&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Escobar, 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; even sees international development as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of former colonies. Escobar shows that, between 1945 and 1960, the former colonies were going through the [[decolonization]] era, and the development plan helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]]. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of World War II, and during the [[Cold War]], when they were developed to (1) stop the spread of [[communism]] with the spread of capitalist markets, and (2) create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by [[Michel Foucault]] and other [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]].

More recent studies like [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]]'s ''[[The Anti-Politics Machine]]'' argue that the ideas and institutional structure that support Western development projects are fundamentally flawed because of the way the West continues to represent the former colonial world. International development uses an "anti-politics" that ultimately produces failure, despite the best intentions. Finally, studies also point out how development efforts often attempt to de-politicize change by a focus on instrumental assistance (like a school building) but not on the objective conditions that led to the development failure (e.g., the state's neglect of rural children at the expense of urban elite), nor the content of what the school might or might not teach. In this sense, the critique of international development focuses on the insidious effects of projects that at the least offer band-aids that address symptoms but not causes, and that at the worst promote projects that systematically redirect economic resources and profit to the West.

== Applied anthropology in development ==
While anthropological studies critique the Western assumptions and political context of development projects, anthropologists also consult on and work within aid institutions in the creation and implementation of development projects. While economists look at aggregate measures like [[gross national product]] and [[per capita income]], as well as measures of [[income distribution]] and [[economic inequality]] in a society, anthropologists can provide a more fine-grained analysis of the qualitative information behind these numbers, such as the nature of the social groups involved and the social significance of the composition of income. Thus, development anthropologists often deal with assessing the important qualitative aspects of development sometimes ignored by an economic approach.

'''Dyadic developmental psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment method for families that have children with symptoms of [[emotional disorder]]s, including [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] and disorders of [[Attachment disorder|attachment]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman, A. 2008 pp.329-337"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., &amp; Hughes, D., (2008) "Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: An evidence-based treatment for children with complex trauma and disorders of attachment," Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work, 13, pp.329-337&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Daniel Hughes as an intervention for children whose emotional distress resulted from earlier separation from familiar caregivers.&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;Hughes, D. (2003). Psychological intervention for the spectrum of attachment disorders and intrafamilial trauma. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 5, 271–279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; Hughes cites [[attachment theory]] and particularly the work of [[John Bowlby]] as theoretical motivations for [[Wiktionary:dyadic|dyadic]] developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hughes D|year= 2004|title= An attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people|journal= Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume= 3|pages= 263–278|url= http://www.attachmentcoalition.org/DDP.pdf|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022654/http://www.attachmentcoalition.org/DDP.pdf|archivedate= 25 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bretherton, I., 1992"&gt;Bretherton, I.,(1992) "The origins of attachment theory," Developmental Psychotherapy, 28:759-775.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes, J., (1993)"&gt;Holmes, J.(1993) John Bowlby and Attachment Theory, London:Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-07729-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic developmental therapy principally involves creating a "playful, accepting, curious, and empathic" environment in which the therapist attunes to the child's "subjective experiences" and reflects this back to the child by means of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movements, voice tone, timing and touch, "co-regulates" emotional affect and "co-constructs" an alternative autobiographical narrative with the child. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy also makes use of [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] strategies. The "dyad" referred to must eventually be the parent-child dyad. The active presence of the primary caregiver is preferred but not required.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

A study by Arthur Becker-Weidman in 2006, which suggested that dyadic developmental therapy is more effective than the "usual treatment methods" for [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]],&lt;ref name="bw1"&gt;Becker-Weidman. ''Treatment for Children with Trauma-Attachment Disorders: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy'', Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal. 23(2), April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., (2006b). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC). According to the APSAC Taskforce Report and Reply, dyadic developmental psychotherapy does not meet the criteria for designation as "evidence based" nor provide a basis for conclusions about "usual treatment methods".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al." &gt;Chaffin, M. et al.

"Examining Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Adopted and Foster Children: A Review of Research and Theory", ''Research on Social Work Practice November'', 24(6), pp. 715-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy is based on the theory that maltreated infants not only frequently have [[Attachment in children|disorganized attachments]] but also, as they mature, are likely to develop rigid self-reliance that becomes a compulsive need to control all aspects of their environment. Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

It is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states "Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

The therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.

==Methods==

Firstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes "The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.

The aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. "As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words." (Hughes 2004 p18)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==
DDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making "a real logical jump" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"&gt;Pignotti, M., &amp; Mercer, J. (2007). Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited.   Research on Social Work Practice, 17 (4),  pp. 513–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques—features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book "Facilitating Developmental Attachment", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of "attachment therapies by another name", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self."&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997"&gt;Daniel A. Hughes (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205224739/http://danielahughes.homestead.com/fdaintro.html Facilitating Developmental Attachment: The Road to Emotional Recovery and Behavioral Change in Foster and Adopted Children]. Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Taskforce report on attachment disorder, reactive attachment disorder and attachment therapy, published in 2006, places Hughes and Becker-Weidman within the attachment therapy paradigm and indeed specifically cites Becker-Weidman for, amongst other things, the use of age regression, though not for coercive or restraining practices (p.&amp;nbsp;79). They also describe DDP as an attachment therapy in their November 2006 Reply to Letters.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}} "Dr. Becker-Weidman is cited three times in the body of the report, none of which refer to coercive techniques. The first citation references his Web site's assertion that traditional therapies are either ineffective or harmful (p. 78). The second citation references his recommendation that children be encouraged to regress to an earlier age as part of treatment (p. 79). The third citation references his assertions, which we believe are unsupported, about practicing an evidence-based treatment (p. 85)."&lt;/ref&gt; Becker-Weidman had stated in his letter to the Taskforce that it was essential to treat a child at its developmental rather than chronological level, but the Taskforce in its November 2006 Reply to Letters disagreed (p.&amp;nbsp;382).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman Letter"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman, Letter to the Editor, Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 379, {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292632}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taskforce in their ''Reply to Letters'' describe Hughes as "a leading [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapist]]" and cite Hughes (together with Kelly and Popper) as examples of attachment therapists who have more recently developed their practices away from the more concerning attachment therapy techniques (p.&amp;nbsp;383).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply3"&gt;"Hughes went on to describe how his own practice of attachment therapy has changed during the years, specifically in terms of less emphasis on parental victory in power struggles, less use of holding techniques, and rejection of cathartic or dysregulated ventilation of past trauma in favor of approaches that sound very similar to well-supported gradual exposure techniques. Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was "evidence based" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman/Kansas"&gt;Becker-Weidmann, A. (3/7/2004). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, retrieved
3/20/2004 from http://www.center4familydevelop.com/developmentalpsych.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uta et al."&gt;Uta M. Walter, U., M. and Petr, C. Best Practices in Children's Mental Health: "Reactive Attachment Disorder: Concepts, Treatment and Research" Produced by the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare in conjunction with Kansas Social Rehabilitation Services pp 10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' model is described as more clearly incorporating researched concerns about 'pushing' children to revisit trauma (as this can re-traumatize victims) and as having integrated established principles of trauma treatment into his approach. Avoiding dysregulation is described by Hughes as a primary treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Uta et al."/&gt;

Prior and Glaser state that Hughes's therapy 'reads' as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with 'little application of attachment theory', but do not include it in their section on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Prior 2006"&gt;Prior, V., and Glaser, D. (2006). ''Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Child and adolescent mental health series. | p268 | {{ISBN|1-84310-245-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trowell, while admiring Hughes's clinical skills, stated that "Parents and carers need their own specific parent work and the children and young people need specific work tailored to their needs ... parents with their own unmet attachment needs from childhood may significantly inhibit their ability to speak frankly with, and feel supported by professionals aiming to help their children".&lt;ref&gt;Trowell, J. (2004). Reflections on 'an attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people'. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 6(3), 279-283&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the use of facial expressions in attempts at attunement, Trowell noted, "although the therapist may look and feel sad, the young person may see this as a provocation-- either hit out or the therapist may be perceived to be triumphant (the facial expression may be misread)" (p.&amp;nbsp;281). Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that "There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically."

==Evidence==
Two research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"/&gt; The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.  The study also used the [[Attachment therapy|Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire]] as a measure,&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; which has not been empirically validated for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt; Statistical comparisons were performed using multiple [[t-test]]s rather than an [[analysis of variance]]; this has been criticized because t-tests increase the chance of finding any significant differences.&lt;ref name="mercer2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mercer J | year = 2015 | title = Revisiting an Article About Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: The Life Cycle of a Woozle | journal = Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | doi  = 10.1007/s10560-015-0399-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment group comprised thirty-four subjects whose cases were closed in 2000/01. This was compared to a "usual care group" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of "usual care" or clarify why the "usual care" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

In the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

Becker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"/&gt; The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt; Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.&lt;ref name="Letter to the Editor"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | 
&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.&lt;ref name="Reply p3"&gt;"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time." Reply to Letters p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven &amp; Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, &amp; Hanson (2004) system.&lt;ref name= "Craven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2004"&gt;Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., &amp; Hanson, R.F.

Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 29, 303-313&lt;/ref&gt; They placed both in Category 3 as "supported and acceptable". This classification means that the evidence basis is weak, but that there is no evidence of harm done by the treatment. The Craven &amp; Lee classification report has been criticized as unduly favourable.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; This critique noted the absence of a comprehensive manual giving details of the dyadic developmental psychotherapy intervention—one of the necessary criteria for assessment using the Saunders et al. guidelines, and one without which no outcome study can be placed in any of the available categories. Craven and Lee rebutted this paper in a reply that concentrated on holding therapy rather than dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Craven &amp; Lee 2007"&gt;Lee, R.E., &amp; Craven, P. (2007). Reply to Pignotti and Mercer: Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions.

It appears from the reports that attachment therapy techniques may have been used in addition to standard DDP. The therapist in Becker-Weidman's study instructed parents to use the "[[Attachment therapy#Parenting techniques|attachment parenting methods]]" of two authors who are described by Jean Mercer as advocating "coercive and intimidating approaches to children in treatment", specifically physical restraint and withholding of food and drink. Because of this deviation from the modern presentation of DDP, Mercer argues that the study cannot be considered a test of DDP in its current form.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Mercer cites Becker-Weidman's research as an example of the [[Woozle effect]], in which "flawed, limited, or exaggerated data" is uncritically repeated and republished until it achieves popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt;

'''Eloquentia Perfecta,''' a tradition of the [[Society of Jesus]], is a value of Jesuit rhetoric that revolves around cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.

Steven Mallioux, a Professor of Rhetoric at [[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]], concluded that "an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallioux|first=Steven|date=2013|title=A Good Person Speaking Well: Eloquentia Perfecta in U.S. Jesuit Colleges: A Brief Genealogy|url=|journal=Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education: Vol. 43, Article 6.|volume=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] to courses in American Colleges such as [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount University]], [[University of San Francisco]], and [[Fordham University]].

[[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]]'s core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that "It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening." The second aspect is, "The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/AssetFactory.aspx?did=65635|title=JESUIT RHETORICAL ARTS: ELOQUENTIA PERFECTA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

=== Ancient History ===
In ancient Athens, they had a goal of "perfect eloquence" in their education system, which was long before the Jesuits existed.  They believed that speech had great power and could achieve many things with "perfect eloquence" way of speaking.  [[Isocrates]] taught the "art of word" in his school that he opened and continued with words are needed to express one's thoughts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|date=May 16, 2011|title=Eloquentia: a short history|url=|journal=America|publisher=America Press, Inc.|volume=204|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1500's ===
Jesuit education is believed by many Jesuits that the late sixteenth century's [[Ratio Studiorum]] was the founding document of Jesuit education. Under [[Ratio Studiorum]], "perfect eloquence" was renamed Eloquentia Perfecta.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ratio was developed from an idea from [[Ignatius of Loyola]] vision of education which had a baseline of classical humanities with a Renaissance focus. In addition, there was some math and history. As students go up to higher education, there is an integration of the study of science, logic, philosophy, and theology. With each progressive year of education, the Jesuit values of Eloquentia Perfecta is integrated into the curriculum. The goals were not explicit but Eloquentia Perfecta are the ides of "developing an eloquent and mature. For example, when students gave speeches, they had to adapt to different audiences and be able to speak in a variety of styles to persuade the audience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Changing Practice of Liberal Education and Rhetoric in Jesuit Education, 1600-2000|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, NY|pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1700's ===
As education of the eighteenth century arose, Jesuit education in France was revised with the addition of sciences, plays, speeches, and the discussion of philosophical ideas. Along with the revision, however, Jesuit education maintained the practices of lectures, critical thinking, public speaking, as well as challenging students with quizzes and exams.  The differences between traditional thinking and modern thinking provided a divide during changing times in the Enlightenment. The goal of education remained as the education aimed to strengthen the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence. Students who attended Universities in the eighteenth century had the option of only getting a master's degree, however towards the end of the century, universities had incorporate BAs (Bachelor of Arts) and BSs (Bachelor of Science) degrees that students could get. If the student wanted to continue their education then they could get their master's as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1900's ===
American Jesuit liberal-arts-colleges in the mid-twentieth-century had a new major discipline incorporated into their educational system. In college, students would have to take two thirds of their college requirement credits on liberal education and the other third on their major. Before the twentieth century, students had to learn about classical core education, however, it has changed to a professional field which includes nursing, business, and education. Furthermore, there are still studies in rhetoric and logic that students are required to take involving speech and debate. In the education system, some teachers still use earlier Jesuit colleges methods where they provide lectures and exams while others use more recent methods like discussion and question-answer from students. Graduates from college during this time period say that the most crucial benefit they got out of their educational experience was that they "learned to think", which means integrating concepts from the old and new ideas in society in involving a person's mind and character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Education  ==

=== Jesuit Rhetoric ===
In 1599, the [[Society of Jesus]] was presented with ''[[Ratio Studiorum]],'' which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. These schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal [[orator]]s by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum.

Gert Beista, the author of ''The Beautiful Risk of Education'', explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, "reconnecting with the question of purpose in education." The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‘‘do something’’ within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is ''socialization'' where Beista states that, "Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders." The last objective is what Beista likes to call, ''subjectification.'' This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|date=|title=Jesuit Eloquentia Perfecta and Theotropic Logology|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|volume=34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit Colleges ===
Although Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. After the American Civil War, however, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature.

With the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included ''Ars Dicendi'' by German Jesuit [[Joseph Kleutgen]], ''A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric'', and ''The Art of Oratorical Composition'' both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, [[Charles Coppen]]s. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus]] in Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, “the art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.” He defines oratory as, “the branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.” Lastly, he defines eloquence as, “the expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Ways of Proceeding: Eloquentia Perfecta in American Jesuit Colleges|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823264520|location=United States of America|pages=162–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignation Pedagogy ===
The [[Ignatius of Loyola]] created a document of the ''Spiritual Exercises,'' a sequence of meditations that have been utilized in universities. These spiritual practices have been around since the sixteenth century and have been more accessible to people around the world as it was published over 4,500 times. Jesuit Spiritual Exercises have been the groundwork of Ignation pedagogy, also known as the [[Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm|Ignation pedagogical paradigm]]. Ignition pedagogy, which started in 1980's, is the discipline that cultivates a person's understanding, behavior, and contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unfinished Business of Eloquentia Perfecta in Twenty-First-Century Jesuit Higher Education|last=Gannett|first=Cinthia|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, New York|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eloquentia Perfecta in Modern Times  ==

=== Adaptation to Rhetorical Changes in Eloquentia Perfecta ===
Many scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive.  Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, "News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmach|first=Robert J.|date=September 1, 2013|title=Talking Back: Eloquentia Perfecta: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Article 24|volume=46|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, people are feeling more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in the Digital Age ===
As many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people whom use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, and justice messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reitmeyer|first=Morgan T|last2=Sci|first2=Susan A.|date=March 1, 2013|title=How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta|url=|journal=Article 19|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People ===
One prime example of Eloquentia Perfecta, being  [[Jeannie Gaffigan]], a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian, was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham’s Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016.  The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity.  As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed.  She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty.  As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, “Love ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,” and spreads this faith through her many social platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.fordham.edu/faith-and-service/catholic-comedian-jeannie-gaffigan-accepts-eloquentia-perfecta-award/|title=Catholic Comedian Jeannie Gaffigan Accepts Eloquentia Perfecta Award|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta and Other Rhetorical Phrases of Past and Modern Tradition ===
'''''"Eloquentia Perfecta."'''''

Eloquentia Perfecta is the most fundamental goal of all of these four practices listed below.  The perfect eloquence is achieved through literature of many different cultures, where one must first understand other cultural and rhetorical languages to master this practice.  These practices were all created in the early ages of Jesuit teachings, yet all still are related to modern day times. Eloquentia Perfecta is ultimately the only quality in which one must have to fulfill any sort of leadership role. Many believe that it is more important to have perfect eloquence in language and communication than it is to have any sore of technology-based skills in higher up positions in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Malley|first=John S.J|date=March 1, 2013|title="Not for Ourselves Alone:" Rhetorical Education in the Jesuit Mode With Five Bullet Points for Today|url=|journal=Article 4|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''“The fly in the bottle.”'''''

This metaphor first came alive by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1914.  It originally was used to help students get out of their comfort ones and expand their critical thinking skills by becoming exposed to different languages and cultures.  It have been adopted into modern day education where educators can push students to think about the questions of life that don't necessarily apply to their particular areas of skill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“Heritage and Perspective.”'''''

"Heritage and Perspective" became a popular value in school, as it teaches past-recognition.  It is based on the idea that modern day citizens are formed by the past and must grasp the concept that the past is still relevant to today's world. Without the knowledge of the past it is hard to understand some of the current situations in which an individual in society might get caught up in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“We are not born for ourselves alone.”'''''

[[Pedro Arrupe|Father Pedro Arrupe]] made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings.  He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“The spirit of finesse.”'''''

This phrase became well known by [[Henri-Irénée Marrou|Henri Marrou]], as he dubbed it as the opposite of “geometric spirit.” This phrase is made to push its followers into a humane mentality.  It is meant to “weave webs with words that reflect the webs we weave with our lives, which are not neat geometric patterns but broken in places and filled with knots and tangles.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder''''' is a book by [[David Weinberger]] published in 2007 ({{ISBN|0805080430}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225081434/http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/about/ |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's central premise is that there is no universally acceptable way of classifying information. Starting with the story of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], Weinberger demonstrates that all attempts to classify inherently reflect the biases of the person defining the classification system.

The '''Finnish Meteorological Institute''' ({{lang-fi|Ilmatieteen laitos}}, {{lang-sv|Meteorologiska institutet}}, or simply ''FMI'') is the [[government]] agency responsible for gathering and [[reporting (data)|reporting]] [[weather]] [[data]] and forecasts in [[Finland]]. It is a part of the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] but it operates semi-autonomously.

The Institute is an impartial research and service organisation with expertise covering a wide range of [[atmospheric science]] activities other than gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts. The headquarters of the Institute is in [[Kumpula Campus]], Helsinki, Finland.

== Services ==
FMI provides weather forecasts for aviation, traffic, shipping and media as well as private citizens via internet and mobile devices. It also has air quality services. For sea areas, it provides information about ice cover, sea level changes and waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/services-and-products Services and products] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FMI made openly available data sets such as weather, sea and climate observation data, time series and model data. The [[open data]] is targeted to benefit application developers who want to develop new services, applications and products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvm.fi/-/finnish-meteorological-institute-makes-its-data-sets-public-738767 Finnish Meteorological Institute makes its data sets public] Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers from [[VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland|VTT]] published a study assessing the benefits generated by the services offered by the Finnish Meteorological  Institute. They concluded in sum in range of 260-290 million euros, while the annual budget of the institute was around 50 – 60 million Euros. This leads to estimate for annual benefit-cost ratio for the services to be at least 5:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Leviäkangas |first= Pekka|last2=Hautala |first2=Raine|date= 2009 |title=Benefits and value of meteorological information services – the case of the Finnish Meteorological Institute |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38288770_Benefits_and_value_of_information_services_-_case_Finnish_Meteorological_Institute |journal=Meteorol.

== Observations ==
Finnish Meteorological Institute makes observations of the atmosphere, sea and space at over 400 stations around Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/observations Observations] FMI&lt;/ref&gt; Its weather radar network consists of 10 C-band Doppler radars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/fmi-radar-network FMI Radar network] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The research areas of FMI include [[meteorology]], [[air quality]], [[climate change]], [[earth observation]], [[oceanography|marine]] and arctic research. Every year FMI's researchers publish about 300 peer-reviewed articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/research Science News] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air quality activities===
The Finnish Meteorological Institute has investigated [[air quality]] processes and [[air pollution]] prevention techniques since the early 1970s. Their staff members have comprehensive competence within the areas of [[meteorology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[engineering]]. Integrated work is done in cooperation with many other European research institutes and universities.

The air quality activities conducted by the Institute include:

* Research, testing and development of air quality measuring methods and equipment.
* Development of [[air pollutant]] [[Exhaust gas|emission]] inventories.
* Development of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vehicular pollution [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|line-source]] dispersion models. 
* Dispersion models for hazardous materials. 
* Dispersion models for odorous compounds.

Dispersion models for larger scales (30 to 3000&amp;nbsp;km) are also available.

===Space Research===
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is one of the few places in Finland where [[space research]] takes place. The institute has been a part of several high-profile [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] missions, such as [[Phoenix Lander|Phoenix]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] and [[BepiColombo]], in addition to leading a lander mission of their own, [[MetNet]].&lt;ref name="FMIEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.fmi.fi/|title=Space Research at FMI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked with Spain and the United States to contribute to the [[Rover Environmental Monitoring Station]] (REMS) on Mars Science Laboratory (''Curiosity'').

The Finnish Meteorological Institute has designed and produced parts to the robotic space probe [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] and robotic lander [[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]], which sent some data from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014-2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innoconnections.com/news/finnish-space-technology-on-board-rosetta-and-philae.html Finnish Space Technology On Board Rosetta And Philae] InooConnections 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electric sail|electric solar wind sail]], invented 2006 by FMi scientist [[Pekka Janhunen]], got the 2010 Finnish Quality Innovation Prize among Potential innovations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electric-sailing.fi/&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested in [[ESTCube-1]] satellite.&lt;ref&gt;http://estonia.eu/kosmos/et/estonian-space-office/news/article/389-estcube-1-ceased-working&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
The number of full-time staff of the Finnish Meteorological Institute is about 540. Permanent staff members account for about 2/3 of the Institute's personnel and those with contractual posts account for the remainder. The Institute operates in on a round-the-clock basis and about 30 percent of the full-time staff work in shifts.

54 percent of the staff have university degrees and 15 percent have a licentiate or PhD degree. The average age of the staff is 43 years.

[[File:2006Boston066.jpg|thumb|Freedom Trail next to [[Faneuil Hall]]]]

The '''Freedom Trail''' is a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} path through [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], that passes by 16 locations significant to the [[history of the United States]]. Marked largely with brick, it winds between [[Boston Common]] to the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the [[Old South Meeting House]], the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]], and the [[Paul Revere House]] charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/ |title=Freedom Trail |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported in part by grants from various nonprofits and foundations, private philanthropy, and [[Boston National Historical Park]].

The Freedom Trail was conceived by local journalist William Schofield, who in 1951 suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Boston mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] decided to put Schofield's idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Northeastern University Press |isbn = 1-55553-161-X |publication-place = Boston |title = Building a new Boston: politics and urban renewal, 1950–1970 |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1737146M/Building_a_new_Boston |author = O'Connor, Thomas H. |publication-date = 1993 |id = 155553161X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service operates a visitor's center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history.

Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail's [[Framing (social sciences)|narrative frame]] to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the [[Liberty Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Trouble with the Freedom Trail |author=Alfred F. Young |date=21 Mar 2004 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holmes Rolston III''' (born November 19, 1932) is a philosopher who is University Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Colorado State University]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[environmental ethics]] and the [[relationship between science and religion]]. Among other honors, Rolston won the 2003 [[Templeton Prize]], awarded by [[Prince Philip]] in [[Buckingham Palace]].  He gave the [[Gifford Lectures]], [[University of Edinburgh]], 1997–1998.

The [[Darwinian]] model is used to define the main thematic concepts in Rolston's philosophy and, in greater depth, the general trend of his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index226.html Afeissa, H.

The '''Home Energy Resources Unit''' or Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) is a [[prototype]] [[kitchen appliance]] which is claimed to use [[household waste]] to generate [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709 |title=New gadget turning waste into hot water |last=Gregory-Kumar |first=David |date=2018-04-04 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Household waste, both organic and inorganic, is placed into a main chamber. Plastic and cardboard packaging as well as food waste can be inserted as fuel, and the waste does not need to be sorted or separated.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/video/2018/07/02/machine-transforms-household-trash-into?videoId=441354971&amp;videoChannel=82|title=Machine transforms household trash into fuel|work=Reuters video|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes through an eight-hour cycle. The chamber containing the waste is heated to 100° [[celsius]] to evaporate water and remove [[oxygen]]. The temperature is then increased and [[pyrolysis]] takes place. Oxygen is then re-introduced to allow [[incineration]] of the [[Pyrolysis#Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars|pyrolised waste]] for [[water heating]]. After eight hours, a tankful of stored hot water is produced, and all plastic, cardboard and organic waste is reduced to [[gas]] and [[ash]]. The gas is then used in a domestic [[boiler]], and the ash can be flushed safely into an ordinary sewage system. Any glass or metal waste is left in a [[thermal cleaning|clean state]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709|title=New kitchen appliance turning rubbish into hot water|website=BBC.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/personal-incinerators-are-one-mans-vision-of-the-future/|title=Personal Incinerators Are One Man's Vision of the Future|website=Gizmodo.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human sexual activity''', '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behaviour''' is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most&lt;!--virtually all?--&gt; [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].

==Types==
[[File:1925 Wegener Les Delassements dEros 09 anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Gerda Wegener]]'s 1925 artwork "Les delassements d'Eros" ("The recreations of Eros"), which depicts sexual activity by two women]]
Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology &amp;#124; Men's Fitness |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].

==Mating strategies==
In [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).

Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==
[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year = 2010|pages=335–336|accessdate = 10 November 2012| isbn = 978-1429237192|url =https://books.google.com/?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;q=Men%20and%20women%20may%20have%20different%20levels%20of%20sexual%20drive%2C%20but%20their%20physiological%20responses%20during%20sex%20are%20fairly%20similar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a "[[sex flush]]" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A man's penis will become erect.
* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having [[Fake orgasm|faked it]].&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first,&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=134–135|accessdate = 17 September 2012| isbn = 9780618755714 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOC&gt;{{cite web| title = The Sexual Response Cycle| publisher = [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] | url = http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|accessdate =6 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725051823/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|archivedate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Craighead"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Irving B. Weiner, W. Edward Craighead| title = The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology, Volume 2 | publisher =[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year = 2010|page=761|accessdate = 10 November 2012| isbn = 978-0470170267|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pa5vKqntwikC&amp;pg=PA761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O &amp; Mannila, E (2009).

==Psychological aspects==
Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

===Motivations===
{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}
{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.&lt;ref&gt;Meston &amp; Buss, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the [[sexual arousal|arousal of their sexuality]], especially if they can achieve [[orgasm]]. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from [[foreplay]] and flirting, and from [[Fetishism|fetish]] or BDSM activities,&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-05-26 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&amp;nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&amp;nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Eroticism|erotic activities]]. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the [[sexual desire]] generated by a person to whom they feel [[sexual attraction]]; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of [[Casual sex|casual or social sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex|title=Casual sex - Define Casual sex at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.&lt;ref name=Holbrook1972 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Roughgarden2004 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC | isbn=978-0-520-24073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination theory===
Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with [[self-determination theory]]. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knee C.R. |author2=Lonsbary C. |author3=Canevello A. |author4=Patrick H. | year = 2005 | title = Self-determination and conflict in romantic relationships | url = | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 997–1009 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.997 |pmid=16393030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.

This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment.  When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females.  It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

==Frequency==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Sexually active life expectancy}}
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Osbourne |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |title=Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist |website=[[Mayo Clinic|MayoClinic.com]] |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |archivedate=6 December 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Adolescents===
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/4803| journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252–257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 |pmid=15898860 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"/&gt;

Although opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex.  According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrangalova|first=Zhana|last2=Savin-Williams|first2=Ritch C.|date=1 August 2011|title=Adolescent sexuality and positive well-being: a group-norms approach|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=40|issue=8|pages=931–944|doi=10.1007/s10964-011-9629-7|issn=1573-6601|pmid=21274608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt; Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt;

==Health and safety==
Sexual activity is an innately physiological function,&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.598.3719  " Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity"], ''Medknow Publications'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancy]], contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.

===Unwanted pregnancy===
{{main|Unintended pregnancy}}
Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx | title=Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration? | publisher=[[National Health Service]] | accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use [[birth control|contraception]], such as [[birth control pill]]s, a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]] or sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}
Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's [[bodily fluid]]s or [[mucosal membrane]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Some STIs can also be contracted by using [[Drug injection|IV drug]] [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or [[breastfeeding]].{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Aging===
{{See also|Sexuality in older age}}
Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O., &amp; Haavio-Mannila, E. The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire" ''Journal of Sex Research'' 46(10), 46–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations and society==
{{main|Sexual orientation}}

===Heterosexuality===
{{Main|Heterosexuality}}
[[File:Bathhouse-Valerius Maximus.gif|thumb|[[Brothel]] scene in a public bath, ca. 1475]]
Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===
{{Main|Homosexuality}}
{{See also|Gay sexual practices|Lesbian sexual practices}} 
[[File:An ottoman miniature from the book Sawaqub al-Manaquib depicting Homosexuality.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Ottoman miniature from the book ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib'' depicting homosexuality]]
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.&lt;ref name=APAHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Psychology Help Center |publisher=Apahelpcenter.org |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051520/http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNature&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#accordion1_content_11 What is the nature of same-sex relationships?] American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "[[coming out of the closet]]" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "[[outing]]" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&amp;nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}
People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.&lt;ref name="apahelp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Gender roles and the expression of sexuality===
Social [[gender roles]] can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the [[World Health Organization]] states that, "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf |title=World report on violence and health – World Health Organization |format=PDF |date=27 August 2002 |author=T.G.V. |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as those where the concepts of [[family honor]] and female [[chastity]] are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO – Female genital mutilation|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC – Ethics: Honour Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[gender equality]] and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining [[sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]], as stated by the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817053022/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 August 2007 |title=Paragraph 7.34 of the ICPD Programme of Action |work=Sexuality and Gender Relations |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women."

==BDSM ==

{{Main|BDSM}}
BDSM is a variety of [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.

B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perks, problems, and the people who play: A qualitative exploration of dominant and submissive BDSM roles|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|date = 1 January 2015|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467|first = Ali|last = Hébert|first2 = Angela|last2 = Weaver|pages=49–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/S means "dominant and submissive." A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the usual "power neutral" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[informed consent]] of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].

Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a "dom" for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term "Domme".  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, "top", "bottom" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb]]
In a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,
use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|pmid = 23679066|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to [[psychopathology]]. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

===Same-sex laws===

Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

===Sex outside marriage===
In the West, sex before marriage is not illegal{{Example needed|date=October 2018}}. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex.

Other studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage.  Adolescents were asked how they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being.  Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern-Feisher B.L. |author2=Cornell J.L. |author3=Kropp R.Y. |author4=Tschann J.M. | year = 2005 | title = Oral Versus Vaginal Sex Among Adolescents: Perceptions, Attitudes, and Behaviour | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 845–851 | doi = 10.1542/peds.204-2108 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt; When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt;

===Minimum age of sexual activity (age of consent)===
{{Main|Age of consent}}
The laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-4039-2173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[age of consent]] is typically between 14 and 18 years, but laws vary. In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age.&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |title=Kopple-Wolf.com |publisher=Kopple-Wolf.com |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="supremecourt1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/126545.htm |title=People vs Floers: 126545: April 21, 1999: J.

Age of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous relationships===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

===Sexual abuse===
{{Main|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lawrence Greenfeld |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF |format=PDF |title=Sex Offenses and Offenders |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and survival sex===
{{main|Prostitution}}
People sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) "john." Prostitution is one of the branches of the [[sex industry]]. The [[prostitution and the law|legal status of prostitution]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]], from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes referred to as "the world's oldest profession".&lt;ref&gt;The prostitution of women and girls – Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or [[forced prostitution|forced]] by [[pimp]]s.

[[Survival sex]] is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when [[homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

'''Immunotoxicology''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''ITOX''') is the study of [[immune]] dysfunction resulting from exposure of an organism to a [[xenobiotic]]. The immune dysfunction may take the form of [[immunosuppression]] or alternatively, [[allergy]], [[autoimmunity]] or any number of [[inflammation|inflammatory]]-based diseases or pathologies. Because the [[immune system]] plays a critical role in host resistance to [[disease]] as well as in normal [[homeostasis]] of an organism, identificantion of immunotoxic [[risk]] is significant in the protection of human, animal and [[wildlife]] [[health]].

In the non-adult ([[embryo]], [[fetus]], [[neonate]], [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], [[adolescent]]) this study is referred to as '''Developmental Immunotoxicology''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DIT'''). For most toxicants examined to date, the developing immune system exhibits a heightened sensitivity compared with that of an adult.  For this reason, DIT screening has applications to human, animal and wildlife health protection.
Immunotoxicological responses sometimes leads to extreme health conditions, as we know it is an immunodisfunction problem it becomes fatal. Different people give different type of response to a certain drug as it gets interacted with their immune system. Some people show [[hypersensitivity]] to a specific drug.

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Die Philosophie mit den sieben freien Künsten.JPG|thumb|''{{lang|la|Philosophia et septem artes liberales}}'', the seven liberal arts. From the {{lang|la|[[Hortus deliciarum]]}} of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
'''Liberal arts education''' (from [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|liberalis}} "free" and {{wikt-lang|la|ars}} "art or principled practice") can claim to be the oldest programme of [[higher education]] in Western history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liberalarts.org.uk/liberal-arts/|title=What is Liberal Arts? - Ancient, Medieval, Modern - Liberal Arts UK|website=www.liberalarts.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its origin in the attempt to discover first principles – 'those universal principles which are the condition of the possibility of the existence of anything and everything'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882530818|title=Philosophy and modern liberal arts education : freedom is to learn|last=Nigel.|first=Tubbs,|isbn=9781137358912|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=882530818}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''liberal arts''' are those subjects or skills that in [[classical antiquity]] were considered essential for a free person ({{lang|la|liberalis}}, "worthy of a free person")&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Robert Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' [1948], trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), p. 37. The classical sources include Cicero, ''De Oratore'', I.72–73, III.127, and ''De re publica,'' I.30.&lt;/ref&gt; to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that (for [[ancient Greece]]) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. [[Grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]] were the core liberal arts (the [[trivium]]), while [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], the theory of [[music]], and [[astronomy]] also played a – somewhat lesser – part in education (as the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liberal arts'' today can refer to academic subjects such as [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], and [[social science|social]] and [[science|physical sciences]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oxford Dictionary| work = [[The Oxford Dictionary]] | url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/liberal-arts?q=Liberal+arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''liberal arts education'' can refer to overall studies in a liberal arts degree program. For both interpretations, the term generally refers to matters not relating to the [[professional]], [[vocational]], or [[Technology|technical]] curriculum.

==History==
[[File:4283 Print 13536kopie.jpg|thumb|''Allegory of the seven liberal arts,'' [[The Phoebus Foundation]] ]]
Rooted in the basic curriculum – the {{transl|grc|enkuklios paideia}} or "education in a circle" – of late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]], the "liberal arts" or "liberal pursuits" (Latin {{lang|la|liberalia studia}}) were already so called in formal education during the [[Roman Empire]]. The first recorded use of the term "liberal arts" ({{lang|la|artes liberales}}) occurs in {{lang|la|[[De Inventione]]}} by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], but it is unclear if he created the term.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Bruce. ''Orators and Philosophers''. New York: College Entrance Examination Board, 1995. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Inventione''. Book 1, Section 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] discusses liberal arts in education from a critical [[Stoicism|Stoic]] point of view in ''[[Moral Epistles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Schneider |url=http://www.stoics.com/seneca_epistles_book_2.html#%E2%80%98LXXXVIII1 |title=Seneca – ''Epistle'' 88|publisher=Stoics.com |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times,&lt;ref name="H. Lausberg, 1998 p. 10"&gt;H. Lausberg, ''Handbook of Literary Rhetoric'' (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only after [[Martianus Capella]] in the [[5th century AD]] influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the ''[[De nuptiis|Marriage of Mercury and Philology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; that they took on canonical form.

{{anchor|Seven liberal arts|The seven liberal arts}}

The four 'scientific' {{lang|la|artes}} – music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy (or astrology) – were known from the time of [[Boethius]] onwards as the ''[[quadrivium]]''. After the 9th century, the remaining three arts of the '[[humanities]]' – grammar, logic, and rhetoric – were grouped as the [[trivium (education)|''trivium'']].&lt;ref name="H. Lausberg, 1998 p. 10" /&gt; It was in that two-fold form that the seven liberal arts were studied in the [[Medieval university|medieval Western university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = James Burke: The Day the Universe Changed ''In the Light Of the Above''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgXzwOV-WNI&amp;t=02m26s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner1983"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfQ2AAAAIAAJ|title=The Seven liberal arts in the Middle Ages|last=Wagner|first=David Leslie|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1983|isbn=9780253351852|accessdate=5 January 2013}} at Questia [https://www.questia.com/read/96213334/the-seven-liberal-arts-in-the-middle-ages]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], logic gradually came to take predominance over the other parts of the ''trivium''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) pp. 141–3&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Gherardo di giovannid el fora, musica, in marziano capella de nuptiis philologiae et mercurii, ms. urb lat 329 f 149v bibl ap vat.jpg|thumb|Page from ''[[De nuptiis|Marriage of Mercury and Philology]]'']]

In the [[Renaissance]], the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process.&lt;ref&gt;G. Norton ed., ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism Vol 3'' (1999)p. 46 and pp. 601–4&lt;/ref&gt; Re-christening the old trivium with a new and more ambitious name: {{lang|la|[[Humanitas|Studia humanitatis]]}}, and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy ([[ethics]]), with a new emphasis on poetry as well.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humanities|educational curriculum of humanism]] spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Nauert, ''Humanism and the Culture of Renaissance Europe (New Approaches to European History)'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in [[Classics|classical languages and literature]], persisted until the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Some subsections of the liberal arts are in the trivium—the verbal arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric—and in the quadrivium—the numerical arts of music and astronomy. Each subsection includes the analysis and interpretation of information.

Academic areas that are associated with the term liberal arts include:
* [[Arts]] ([[fine arts]], [[music education|music]], [[performing arts]], [[literature]])
* [[Philosophy]]
* [[Religious studies]]
* [[Social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]])
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Natural Sciences]] ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[earth sciences]])

For example, the core courses for [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Doctor of Liberal Studies]] program&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown University Doctor of Liberal Studies curriculum http://scs.georgetown.edu/departments/6/doctor-of-liberal-studies/about-the-program/curriculum#curriculum&lt;/ref&gt; cover philosophy, theology, history, art, literature, and the social sciences. [[Wesleyan University]]'s [[Master of Arts in Liberal Studies]] program includes courses in visual arts, art history, [[creative writing|creative]] and professional writing, literature, history, mathematics, film, government, education, biology, psychology, and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/masters/index.html|title=Graduate Liberal Studies - Wesleyan University|website=www.wesleyan.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary school==
The liberal arts education at the secondary school level prepares the student for [[higher education]] at a [[university]]. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a liberal arts education often study [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]].

Some liberal arts education provide general education, others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:
* [[humanities]] education (specializing in [[classical languages]], such as [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]])
* modern languages (students are required to study at least three languages)
* lower level mathematical-scientific education
* economical and social-scientific education (students are required to study simple [[economics]], [[world history]], [[social studies]] and [[business informatics]])

Curricula differ from school to school, but generally include [[language]], [[mathematics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[arts|art]] (as well as crafts and design), [[music]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[civics]] / citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;this subject has different names in the different states of Germany. See [[:de:Gemeinschaftskunde]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[social science]]s, and several foreign languages.

Schools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the [[German constitution]] guarantees the [[separation of church and state]], so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.

Today, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] specializing in economics, technology or [[domestic sciences]]. Some countries also have ''[[progymnasium]]''s, which may lead to studying in a gymnasium.

==In the United States==
{{main article|Liberal arts college}}
{{further information|Liberal arts colleges in the United States|Great books}}

In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing [[undergraduate]] study in the liberal arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Liberal Arts Education|url=http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/storage/Defining_Liberal_Education.pdf|publisher=Wabash College|accessdate=9 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021110926/http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/storage/Defining_Liberal_Education.pdf#|archive-date=21 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often [[Socratic method|Socratic]], typically with small classes, and often has a lower [[student-to-teacher ratio]] than at large [[universities]]; professors teaching classes are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than primary research [[Professors in the United States|professors]] or [[teaching assistants|graduate student teaching assistants]] at [[universities]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Dartmouth College is a well-known liberal arts college, in addition to several small liberal arts colleges in the northeastern part of the United States.

In addition, most four-year colleges are not devoted exclusively or primarily to liberal arts degrees, but offer a liberal arts degree, and allow students not majoring in liberal arts to take courses to satisfy [[distribution requirements]] in liberal arts.

Traditionally, a bachelor's degree either in liberal arts in general or in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as [[Saint Leo University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.saintleo.edu/academics/associate-programs/liberal-arts.aspx |title=Online Liberal Arts Associate Degree |publisher=Saint Leo University |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/letters-arts-and-sciences-associates/overview |title=Online Associate in Arts in Letters, Arts, and Sciences &amp;#124; Overview |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-aa-liberal-arts-degree/ |title=Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts – Liberal Arts Degree Online |publisher=Florida Institute of Technology |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New England College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associates in Liberal Studies|url=http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/associates-degree-liberal-studies/|publisher=[[New England College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to offer an [[associate degree]] in liberal arts. Colleges like [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, NH offer a unique program with only one degree offering, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, and colleges like the [[University of Oklahoma College of Liberal Studies]] offers an online, part-time option for adult and nontraditional students.

Most students earn either a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree or a [[Bachelor of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s bachelor of science degree in Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies http://www.modlangs.gatech.edu&lt;/ref&gt; degree; on completing undergraduate study, students might progress to either a liberal arts graduate school or a [[professional school]] ([[public administration]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[law]], [[medicine]], [[theology]]).

==In Europe==
In most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system it is called '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''humanistische Bildung''' (humanistic education). The term is not to be mixed up with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a [[Gymnasium (school)|''Gymnasium'']]" (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education (''[[Bildung]]'') in order to form personality with regard to a pupil's own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; in particular, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at ''gymnasiums'', very often the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate programs at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Students are expected to use their skills received at the ''gymnasium'' in order to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities' music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs, etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university's curriculum.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Thus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''liberal arts college'' usually denotes [[liberal arts colleges in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} With the exception of pioneering institutions such as [[Franklin University Switzerland]] (formerly known as Franklin College), established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/ |title=About Franklin |work=Franklin University Switzerland Official Web Site |publisher=Franklin University Switzerland |accessdate=2014-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408064857/http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; only recently some efforts have been undertaken to systematically "re-import" liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with [[Leiden University College The Hague]], [[University College Utrecht]], [[University College Maastricht]], [[Amsterdam University College]], [[Roosevelt Academy]] (now University College Roosevelt), ATLAS University College, [[Erasmus University College]], the [[University of Groningen]], [[Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts]], and [[Bard College Berlin]], formerly known as the [[European College of Liberal Arts]]. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences ([[Tilburg University]]). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does [[St. Mary's University College (Belfast)|St. Marys University College Belfast]], both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology [[:Category:Liberal arts colleges at universities in the Netherlands|''university college'']] since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/las |title=Liberal Arts and Sciences Program (LAS) |publisher=''University College Freiburg |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820031719/http://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/las |archivedate=20 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Liberal Arts degree program in [[Sweden]] was established at [[Gothenburg]] University in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flov.gu.se/utbildning/grundniva/liberal-arts/|title=Liberal Arts, Gothenburg University|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Flov.gu.se|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at [[Uppsala University]]'s Campus [[Gotland]] in the autumn of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=HLA1K&amp;lasar=13%2F14 |title="Liberal Arts Programme at Uppsala University" |access-date=29 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630163906/http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=HLA1K&amp;lasar=13%2F14 |archive-date=30 June 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Liberal Arts program in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was introduced in 2005 by [http://agile.ge/ American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE)],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agile.ge/|title=Agile|publisher=Agile.ge|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]].

In [[France]], [[Chavagnes Studium]], a Liberal Arts Study Centre in partnership with the Institut Catholique d'études supérieures, and based in a former Catholic seminary, is launching a two-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts, with a distinctively Catholic outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chavagnes.org/studium |title=The Chavagnes Studium – Catholic Liberal Arts Centre |publisher=Chavagnes.org |date=2018-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/education/higher_education/berlins-sturdiest-ivory-tower-8661_10047.html?ppager=0|title=Berlin's sturdiest ivory tower|publisher=Expatica.com|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it introduced a four-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090313110639526|title=GERMANY: New approach to liberal studies|date=15 March 2009|publisher=Universityworldnews.com|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities.

In [[Scotland]], the four-year [[undergraduate]] [[Honours degree]], specifically the [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]], has historically demonstrated considerable breadth in focus. In the first two years of Scottish MA and BA degrees students typically study a number of different subjects before specialising in their Honours years (third and fourth year). The [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] (at its Crichton Campus) are the only Scottish universities that currently offer a specifically named 'Liberal Arts' degree.

==In Asia==
The Commission on Higher Education of the [[Philippines]] mandates a General Education curriculum required of all higher education institutions; it includes a number of liberal arts subjects, including history, art appreciation, and ethics, plus interdisciplinary electives. Many universities have much more robust liberal arts core curricula; most notably, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] universities such as [[Ateneo de Manila University]] have a strong liberal arts core curriculum that includes philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the social sciences. [[Forman Christian College]] is a liberal arts university in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. It is one of the oldest institutions in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is a chartered university recognized by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]]. [[Habib University]] in [[Karachi]], Pakistan offers a holistic liberal arts and sciences experience to its students through its uniquely tailored liberal core program which is compulsory for all undergraduate degree students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2014/12/liberal-classes/ ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aurora.dawn.com/2014/03/01/liberal-to-the-core/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183811/http://aurora.dawn.com/2014/03/01/liberal-to-the-core/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Underwood International College of Yonsei University, Korea, has compulsory liberal arts course for all the student body. [http://www.ssla.edu.in Symbiosis] &amp; [[FLAME University]] in Pune, [[Ahmedabad University]], [[Ashoka University]], [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] and [[University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh|University of Liberal Arts- Bangladesh (ULAB)]] are also a few such liberal arts colleges in Asia. [[International Christian University]] in [[Tokyo]] is the first and one of the very few liberal arts universities in [[Japan]].

==In Australia==

[[Campion College]] is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] dedicated liberal arts college, located in the western suburbs of [[Sydney]]. Founded in 2006, it is the first tertiary educational liberal arts college of its type in [[Australia]]. Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines studied are history, literature, philosophy, and theology.

== The Great Books Movement ==
In 1936 [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] changed its curriculum to focus on the [[Great Books of the Western World|Great Books]] of Western Civilization in order to provide a new sort of education that separated itself from the increasingly specialized nature of higher schooling. This was one of the first instances of a revival for the more classical approach to the Liberal Arts as expounded by Plato and Cicero. Later in the 1960s, in response to the sexual revolution and growing hostility toward free-speech, many small institutes began to incorporate in order to counter this culture of anti-academic thought. This is most notably the work of many small Catholic Liberal Arts institutions, like the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]], that adopted the Great Books as a core for their humanities program while at the same time preserving the seven liberal arts as way of preparing their students to think for themselves rather than accept what their professors told them to think. With the introduction of the Great Books, the liberal arts education was now in direct conversation with the great minds of history who have shaped the modern world as we know it. At the same these colleges focused on the basic formation of one's intellect that came from exercising the tools of logic, grammar, and rhetoric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5900">The '''Modern Architectural Research Group''', or '''MARS Group''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[architecture|architectural]] think tank founded in 1933 by several prominent architects and architectural critics of the time involved in the British [[International style (architecture)|modernist movement]]. The MARS Group came after several previous but unsuccessful attempts at creating an organization to support modernist architects in Britain such as those that had been formed on continental Europe, like the Union des Artistes Modernes in [[France]].  

The group first formed when [[Sigfried Giedion]] of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] asked [[Morton Shand]] to assemble a group that would represent Britain at their events.  Shand, along with [[Wells Coates]], chose [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[F. R. S. Yorke]] as the founding members.  They were also joined by a few members of [[Tecton]], another architectural group, by [[Ove Arup]] and by [[John Betjeman]], a poet and contributor to ''[[Architectural Review]]''. The group's greatest success came in 1938 with a show at the New Burlington Galleries, but it also unfortunately left them in debt. The MARS group proposed a radical plan for the redevelopment of postwar London, the details of which were published the Architectural Review in 1942.&lt;ref name="odnb01"&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60598, accessed 27 Dec 2008. Charlotte Benton. 2004. 'Korn, Arthur (1891–1978)’ in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height there were about 58 members in the group.The group itself began to lose steam along with the movement and many members left as a result of creative differences.  The group finally disbanded in 1957.

==The MARS Plan for London==

:"The plan for London issued by the Mars Group (the English wing of CIAM) and prepared by their Town Planning Committee was a marked contrast to anything that had gone before and, one might add, anything produced subsequently. It was frankly [[Utopian]] and Socialistic in concept."  Dennis Sharp, 1971.&lt;ref name="sharp01"/&gt;

The plan was devised by what has been described as a 'small and devoted' group, under the town planning sub committee of MARS, chaired by [[Arthur Korn (architect)|Arthur Korn]], and including Arthur Ling, [[Maxwell Fry]], the latter who worked as secretary, and fellow Jewish emigre, engineer [[Felix Samuely]].&lt;ref name="fry01"&gt;Pp 165-6 ''in'' Fry  E. M. 1971, ' The MARS Group plan of London ''in'' Arthur Korn, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Dennis Sharp]]. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London. ''Perspecta, Vol. 13 (1971), pp. 163-173''&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Korn is described as having been 'the main spring of the enterprise'  and as providing an 'infectious enthusiasm' that drove the project forward.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gold01"&gt;P.88 ''in'' Gold J. R. 2000. 'Towards the functional city? MARS, CIAM and the London plans 1933-42. ''In'' Thomas Deckker, ''The Modern City Revisited''. Oxford: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by the Soviet urbanist Miliutin, the plan essentially conceived the centre of the city remaining much the same but with a series of linear forms or tongues extending from the Thames, described as like a herring bone, composed of social units and based around the rail network.&lt;ref name="sharp01"&gt;P. 167 ''in'' Sharp S. 1971. 'Concept and Interpretation The aims and principles of the MARS plan for London'. ''In ''Arthur Korn, Maxwell Fry, Dennis Sharp. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London.

Oxford: Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Habitation in each social unit was to consist mainly of flats and owed much to  [[Le Corbusier]]'s notion of the [[Unite d'Habitation|''unite d'habitation'']].&lt;ref name="moughtin01"/&gt; Described as 'unworkable' by [[Dennis Sharp]], in his 1971 essay on the plan, he concedes it 'was not a concrete scheme but a concept that would by its very nature produce interpretations'.&lt;ref name="sharp01"/&gt; Marmaras and Sutcliffe argue the plan 'saw London almost entirely in terms of movement ...[being] presented primarily as a centre of exchange and communications'.&lt;ref name="marmaras01"&gt;Pp. 434-40 ''in'' Marmaras E. and Sutcliffe A. 1994. Planning for post-war London: the three independent plans, 1942-3. ''In'' ''Planning Perspectives, 9, (1994) 431-453''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moughtin and Shirley (1995) note that one of the aims of the plan was to promote public transport, where with railways integral to planning, the 'need for cars will be few'. .&lt;ref name="moughtin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="korn01"&gt;A. Korn and F.J. Samuely, A master plan for London,'' Architectural Review, 91, January (1942). 143–150.''&lt;/ref&gt; Korn's initial chairmanship of the plan was interrupted by his 18-month internment in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1939,  being a German citizen, during which period work on the plan fizzled out.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt; On his release, in 1941, work recommenced, an exhibition of the plan was organised and a 'description and analysis' was published under the joint authorship of Arthur Korn and Felix Samuely in the Architectural Association journal in 1942.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marmaras01"/&gt;

'''Manchester Craftsmen's Guild''' (MCG) is a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] art, education, and music organization established in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1968.

Courses include [[ceramic art|ceramics]], photography, [[digital art]]s, and painting to over 500 young people each year and 3,400 additional students in the [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]]. Ninety percent of the students receive high school diplomas, and eight-five percent of those students enroll in college or some other secondary education. The Guild's programs also include MCG Jazz, MCG Youth, and the Denali Initiative. MCG Jazz's mission is to preserve, present and promote jazz.&lt;ref&gt;http://mcgjazz.org/_wp/about&lt;/ref&gt; MCG Youth offers art courses to Pittsburgh public school students. The Denali Initiative is a program that teaches nonprofit executive directors how to develop business and financing plans for [[social enterprise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Corilyn Shropshire, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20011230denali1230fnp4.asp Denali Initiative helps nonprofits make a difference on their own ]", ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', Sunday, December 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was conceived by [[Bill Strickland]]. In 1987, he expanded MCG with a $7.5 million capital campaign to construct a {{convert|62000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[vocational education]] and arts center. It includes a 350-seat concert hall, an art gallery, classrooms, and workshops. MCG Jazz hosts concerts and has a recording studio and record label.

{{Marxism|Sociology}}
'''Karl Marx's theory of alienation''' describes the [[social alienation|estrangement]] (''Entfremdung'') of people from aspects of their ''[[Marx's theory of human nature|Gattungswesen]]'' ("species-essence") as a consequence of living in a society of stratified [[social class]]es. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity.

The theoretic basis of alienation within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the [[bourgeoisie]]—who own the [[means of production]]—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of [[surplus value]] in the course of business competition among industrialists.

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), [[Karl Marx]] expressed the ''Entfremdung'' theory—of estrangement from the self.  Philosophically, the theory of ''Entfremdung'' relies upon ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] which states that the idea of a supernatural god has alienated the natural characteristics of the [[human being]]. Moreover, [[Max Stirner]] extended Feuerbach's analysis in ''[[The Ego and its Own]]'' (1845) that even the idea of "humanity" is an alienating concept for individuals to intellectually consider in its full philosophic implication. Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] responded to these philosophic propositions in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845).

== Types of alienation ==
In a capitalist society, the worker's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can only express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument, a thing and not a person. In the "Comment on James Mill" (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have, in two ways, affirmed himself, and the other person. (i) In my production I would have objectified my individuality, its specific character, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective, visible to the senses, and, hence, a power beyond all doubt. (ii) In your enjoyment, or use, of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work, that is, of having objectified man's essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man's essential nature [...] Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. "Comment on James Mill," ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'': 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), Marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system of industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;Alienation. ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'': Revised Second Edition (1984), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alienation of the worker from their product ===
The design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the [[capitalist class]] who besides accommodating the worker's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the [[engineer]] and the [[industrial designer]] who create the product in order to shape the [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol, alienation (''Entfremdung'') broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a [[use value]] (the product), into a commodity, which—like products—can be assigned an [[exchange value]]. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also [[Reification (Marxism)|reifies]] labour into the "concrete" concept of "work" (a job), for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist's [[investment capital]]; this is an aspect of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the [[Rentier capitalism|rentier capitalist]], who owns the means of production.

=== Alienation of the worker from the act of production === 
In the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for "a job well done". By means of [[commodification]], the [[labor power]] of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (''Entfremdung'') of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms; wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not "voluntary but coerced" (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of [[private property]] in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist. The worker "[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself"; "[l]abor is external to the worker" (p. 74), it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work "mortifies his body and ruins his mind". The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, "labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being (p. 74). A person's mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, "the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another" (p. 74). This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labor's form and direction belong to someone else.

=== Alienation of the worker from their ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence) === 
The ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence), human nature of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person. Conceptually, in the term "species-essence" the word "species" describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a "plurality of interests" and "psychological dynamism", whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as "the subject" and an idea of the thing that they produce, "the object". Conversely, unlike a human being an animal does not objectify itself as "the subject" nor its products as ideas, "the object", because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a [[Consciousness|conscious]] intention. Whereas a person's ''Gattungswesen'' (human nature) does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.

==== Relations of production ====
Whatever the character of a person's consciousness ([[Will (philosophy)|will]] and [[imagination]]), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon co-operation with others, thus, a person's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the [[means of production]]. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the [[relations of production]] of that ''status quo'' the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian [[feudalism]] superseded by [[mercantilism]], in turn superseded by the [[Industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the [[Technology|technologies]] (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') and the [[Value system|system of values]] of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged ''status quo'' of production-relations.

Despite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. Hence, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the [[relations of production]] to the [[means of production]]—from a [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to a [[communist mode of production]]. In the resultant [[communist society]], the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker's labour; the worker's humanity (species-essence) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated (see [[Marx's theory of human nature]]).

In the communist socio-economic organization, the relations of production would operate the [[mode of production]] and employ [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs]]. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, [[Wage slavery|minimal-wage]] "job" meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the [[Reification (Marxism)|objectified]] productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.

=== Alienation of the worker from other workers === 
Capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial [[commodity]] that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the [[means of production]] establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The capitalist economy's arrangement of the [[relations of production]] provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for "higher wages", thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a [[false consciousness]], which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist [[bourgeoisie]] through its [[cultural hegemony]]. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of [[religion]] in justifying the [[relations of production]] facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation (''Entfremdung'') of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being "[[opiate of the people|the opiate of the masses]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s3002.htm Marx on Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical significance ==
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|250px|Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) postulated the [[idealism]] that Marx countered with [[dialectical materialism]]]]
[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|250px|Philosopher [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872) analysed religion from a psychological perspective in ''The Essence of Christianity'' (1841) and according to him divinity is humanity's projection of their human nature]]

===  Influences: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach ===
In [[Marxist theory]], ''Entfremdung'' ([[social alienation|alienation]]) is a foundational proposition about man's progress towards [[self-actualisation]]. In the ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich described the influences of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] upon Karl Marx: &lt;blockquote&gt;For Hegel, the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself, separated from its "essence", which it has placed in a "beyond".&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

As used by the philosophers Hegel and Marx, the reflexive German verbs ''entäussern'' ("to divest one's self of") and ''entfremden'' ("to become estranged") indicate that the term "alienation" denotes self-alienation: to be estranged from one's essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Langenscheidt New College Dictionary'': German–English/English–German (1973) pp. 166 and 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, alienation is a lack of self-worth, the absence of meaning in one's life, consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment, without the opportunity to become actualized, to become one's [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted. ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge, of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel's human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of [[idealism]]—"spiritual ignorance" and "self-understanding"—are replaced with [[materialism|material categories]], whereby "spiritual ignorance" becomes "alienation" and "self-understanding" becomes man's realisation of his ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence).

==== ''Entfremdung'' and the theory of history ====
{{see also|Marx's theory of history|Dialectical materialism}}
In Part I: "Feuerbach – Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook" of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), Karl Marx said the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The German Ideology|date= Fall 1845 to mid-1846|chapter=Part I: Feuerbach. Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their [[self-actualisation]] as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] eventually will [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] and impoverish the [[proletariat]] until compelling them to [[social revolution]] for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of [[Marxist humanism]]. In ''The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism'' (1992), [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] discussed and described the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.

==== ''Entfremdung'' and social class ====
In Chapter 4 of ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each [[social class]] experiences alienation in a different form: &lt;blockquote&gt;The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power, and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch04.htm Chapter 4 of ''The Holy Family'']- see under Critical Comment No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
In discussion of "random materialism" (''matérialisme aléatoire''), the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] criticized such a [[teleology|teleological]] (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation because it rendered the [[proletariat]] as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] of history; an interpretation tainted with the [[Hegelian idealism]] of the "philosophy of the subject", which he criticized as the "bourgeois ideology of philosophy" (see ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' [1923] by [[György Lukács]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alienation.

'''Needlework Development Scheme''' (NDS) was a collaborative program between industry and art education, that was to encourage and initiate a new standard for British embroidery design in both hand and machine work. The organisation was primarily responsible for developing collections of foreign and British embroidery, that could be loaned to training colleges, [[Women's Institutes]], and schools.&lt;ref name="vam" /&gt;

Started in 1934, the program was originally set up in Scotland by the four Scottish art schools, [[Aberdeen art school|Aberdeen]], [[Dundee art school|Dundee]], [[Edinburgh art school|Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow art school|Glasgow]] under the name '''Needlework Development in Scotland Scheme'''. The project was a collaborative initiated between industry and art education, that was to encourage British embroidery design. The project was sponsored anonymously by thread producers [[Coats PLC|J &amp; P Coats]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/n/needlework-development-scheme/ |title=Needlework Development Scheme |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politics and trade in design: Emmy Zweybruck-Prochaska's influential textile designs in needlework development scheme collections|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-175632631.html|work=Textile|publisher=Oxford International Publishers Ltd via [[HighBeam Research]] | last=Heffernan | first=Sandra |accessdate=8 May 2012|date=2007-03-22}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945 the scheme had amassed over 900 embroideries but the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] saw the project disbanded. The Scheme was restated after the war, in 1944, and extended throughout the 1950s to include schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="STHO" /&gt; British artists, including the painter and illustrator [[Mary Kessell]] were speciality commissioned to create experimental designs for the scheme which could then be reinterpreted in embroidery.&lt;ref name="vam" /&gt; The program ended in 1961, having achieved its original aims, and the collection of over 3,500 embroideries, was given to various museums and organisation, including the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="STHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scottishtextileheritage.org.uk/theproject/sample_company_history_description.htm |title=Scottish Textiles Heritage Online |publisher=Scottish Textiles Heritage Online |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616160001/http://scottishtextileheritage.org.uk/theProject/sample_company_history_description.htm |archivedate=16 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ornithology''' is a branch of [[zoology]] that concerns the study of [[birds]]. Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, Ian|year=1998|title=Population limitation in birds|publisher=Academic Press|page=2|isbn=978-0-12-517366-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The science of ornithology has a long history and studies on birds have helped develop several key concepts in evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of [[species]], the process of [[speciation]], [[instinct]], [[learning]], [[ecological niche]]s, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]], [[island biogeography]], [[phylogeography]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]].&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayr, E.|year=1984|title=Commentary: The Contributions of Ornithology to Biology|journal=BioScience|volume=34|issue=4|pages=250–255|doi=10.2307/1309464|jstor=1309464|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species, ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories. Most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups, and the number of professional scientists who identify themselves as "ornithologists" has therefore declined.&lt;ref name=bibby2003/&gt; A wide range of tools and techniques is used in ornithology, both inside the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations are constantly made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, W. J., Newton, Ian and Green, Rhys |year=2004|title=Bird ecology and conservation: a handbook of techniques|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-852086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "ornithology" comes from the late 16th-century Latin ''ornithologia'' meaning "bird science" from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὄρνις ''ornis'' ("bird") and λόγος ''logos'' ("theory, science, thought").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ornithology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of ornithology}}
The history of ornithology largely reflects the trends in the [[history of biology]], as well as many other scientific disciplines, including [[ecology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[paleontology]], and more recently, molecular biology. Trends include the move from mere descriptions to the identification of patterns, thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these patterns.

===Early knowledge and study===
Humans have had an observational relationship with birds since [[prehistory]], with some stone-age drawings being amongst the oldest indications of an interest in birds.&lt;ref name="Gurney, JH 1921"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Gurney, JH |year=1921|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558 |title=Early annals of ornithology |journal=Nature|volume=108|issue=2713|pages=268|bibcode=1921Natur.108..268.|doi=10.1038/108268a0|hdl=2027/coo.31924090299532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bird books and bird art|author=Anker, Jean|publisher=Springer-Science|year=1979|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were perhaps important as food sources, and bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early [[Stone Age]] settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nadel, K.

Other old writings such as the [[Vedas]] (1500–800 BC) demonstrate the careful observation of avian life histories and include the earliest reference to the habit of [[brood parasite|brood parasitism]] by the [[Asian koel]] (''Eudynamys scolopacea'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali, S. |year=1979 |title=Bird study in India: its history and its importance |jstor=23001825|journal=India International Centre Quarterly|volume=6|issue=2 |pages=127–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like writing, the early art of China, Japan, Persia, and India also demonstrate knowledge, with examples of scientifically accurate bird illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, David (1965) Enjoying Ornithology.

[[Aristotle]] in 350 BC in his ''[[History of animals|Historia Animalium]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.6.vi.html |title=Historia Animalium. Translated by D'Arcy Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted the habit of [[bird migration]], moulting, egg laying, and lifespans, as well as compiling a list of 170 different bird species. However, he also introduced and propagated several myths, such as the idea that [[swallow]]s [[hibernated]] in winter, although he noted that [[common crane|cranes]] migrated from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to the marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]]. The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established that even as late as in 1878, [[Elliott Coues]] could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lincoln, Frederick C., Steven R.

The earliest record of falconry comes from the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC) in [[Assyria]]. Falconry is thought to have made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the east after invasions by the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]]. Starting from the eighth century, numerous Arabic works on the subject and general ornithology were written, as well as translations of the works of ancient writers from Greek and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries,  crusades and conquest had subjugated Islamic territories in southern Italy, central Spain, and the Levant under European rule, and for the first time translations into Latin of the great works of Arabic and Greek scholars were made with the help of Jewish and Muslim scholars, especially in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had fallen into Christian hands in 1085 and whose libraries had escaped destruction. [[Michael Scot]]us from Scotland made a Latin translation of Aristotle's work on animals from Arabic here around 1215, which was disseminated widely and was the first time in a millennium that this foundational text on zoology became available to Europeans. Falconry was popular in the [[Normans|Norman]] court in Sicily, and a number of works on the subject were written in [[Palermo]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1194–1250) learned about an falconry during his youth in Sicily and later built up a [[menagerie]] and sponsored translations of Arabic texts, among which the popular Arabic work known as the ''[[Moamyn|Liber Moaminus]]'' by an unknown author which was translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch from Syria in 1240-1241 as the ''De Scientia Venandi per Aves'', and also Michael Scotus (who had removed to Palermo) translated [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]]'s ''Kitāb al-Ḥayawān'' of 1027 for the Emperor, a commentary and scientific update of Aristotle's work which was part of Ibn Sīnā's massive ''[[The Book of Healing|Kitāb al-Šifāʾ]]''. Frederick II eventually wrote his own treatise on falconry, the ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', in which he related his ornithological observations and the results of the hunts and experiments his court enjoyed performing.&lt;ref name="egerton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egerton, F. |year=2003 |title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 8: Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen: Amateur Avian Ecologist and Behaviorist |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=40–44|url=http://esapubs.org/bulletin/current/history_list/history_part8.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[40:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Oppenraay |first=Aafke M.I. |date=2017 |title=Avicenna's ''Liber de animalibus'' ('''Abbreviatio Avicennae''') - Preliminaries and State of Affairs |url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/6003490/Avicenna_s_Liber_de_animalibus_Abbreviatio_Avicennae_._VanOppenraay_2017.pdf |journal=Documenti e Studi Sulla Tradizione Filosofica Medievale |volume=28 |pages=401–416 |doi= |access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early German and French scholars compiled old works and conducted new research on birds. These included [[Guillaume Rondelet]], who described his observations in the Mediterranean, and [[Pierre Belon]], who described the fish and birds that he had seen in France and the Levant. Belon's ''Book of Birds'' (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some 200 species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in [[comparative anatomy]].&lt;ref name="miall"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miall, L.

[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]]'s ''Historia Avium'' (''History of Birds''), published at [[Cologne]] in 1544, was an early ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of [[red kite|kite]]s in English cities where they snatched food out of the hands of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the [[osprey]] emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times in which he lived, and stands in contrast to later works such as [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' that were written in a tranquil era.&lt;ref name="miall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbertwhite"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |title=The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne |year= 1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London |publisher=Cassell &amp; Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Francis Willughby]] (1635–1672) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) came up with the first major system of bird classification that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby's ''Ornithologiae libri tres'' (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on ''Ornithologia'', which was published posthumously in 1713 as ''Synopsis methodica avium et piscium''.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |year=1999 |title=Ornithology Collections in the Libraries at Cornell University: A Descriptive Guide |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ornithology/guide/hillguide.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest list of British birds, ''Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum'', was written by [[Christopher Merrett]] in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koinm, Albert J. |year=2000 |title=Christopher Merrett's Use of Experiment |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray did, however, value the expertise of the naturalist [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82), who not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence.

Towards the late 18th century, [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] (1723–1806) and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) began new works on birds. Brisson produced a six-volume work ''Ornithologie'' in 1760 and Buffon's included nine volumes (volumes 16–24) on birds ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux'' (1770–1785) in his work on science ''Histoire naturelle générale et particulière'' (1749–1804). Jacob Temminck sponsored [[François Le Vaillant]] [1753–1824] to collect bird specimens in Southern Africa and Le Vaillant's six-volume ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique'' (1796–1808) included many non-African birds. His other bird books produced in collaboration with the artist Barraband are considered among the most valuable illustrated guides ever produced. [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] (1748–1831) spent 10 years studying North American birds and wrote the ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amerique septentrionale'' (1807–1808?). Vieillot pioneered in the use of life histories and habits in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |title=Hill Collection — 18th c.

In the early 19th century, [[Lewis and Clark]] studied and identified many birds in the western United States. [[John James Audubon]], born in 1785, observed and painted birds in France and later in the [[Ohio]] and [[Mississippi]] valleys. From 1827 to 1838, Audubon published ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]'', which was engraved by [[Havell family|Robert Havell, Sr.]] and his son Robert Havell, Jr. Containing 435 engravings, it is often regarded as the greatest ornithological work in history.

===Scientific studies===
[[File:Bird eggs.jpg|thumb|left|Early bird study focused on collectibles such as eggs and nests.]]
The emergence of ornithology as a scientific discipline began in the 18th century, when [[Mark Catesby]] published his two-volume ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands'', a landmark work which included 220 hand-painted engravings and was the basis for many of the species [[Carl Linnaeus]] described in the 1758 ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''. Linnaeus' work revolutionised bird taxonomy by assigning every species a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], categorising them into different genera.
However, ornithology did not emerge as a specialised science until the Victorian era—with the concept of natural history, and the collection of natural objects such as bird eggs and skins.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, David E.|year=1994|title=The naturalist in Britain: a social history|isbn=978-0691036328|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farber, Paul L.|year=1982|title=The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760–1850|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialization led to the formation in Britain of the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] in 1858. In 1859, the members founded its journal ''[[The Ibis]]''. The sudden spurt in ornithology was also due in part to [[colonialism]]. At 100 years later, in 1959, [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R. E. Moreau]] noted that ornithology in this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions of various species of birds.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Kristin|year=2004|title=''The Ibis'': Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=37|pages=515–555| doi=10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|No doubt the preoccupation with widely extended geographical ornithology, was fostered by the immensity of the areas over which British rule or influence stretched during the 19th century and for some time afterwards.|Moreau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moreau, R.

The bird collectors of the Victorian era observed the variations in bird forms and habits across geographic regions, noting local specialization and variation in widespread species. The collections of museums and private collectors grew with contributions from various parts of the world. The naming of species with binomials and the organization of birds into groups based on their similarities became the main work of museum specialists. The variations in widespread birds across geographical regions caused the introduction of trinomial names.
[[File:KaupClassification.svg|thumb|Kaup's classification of the crow family]]
The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854), his student [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] (1781–1826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a "natural" classification was available and superior to "artificial" ones. A particularly popular idea was the [[Quinarian system]] popularised by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] (1785–1840), [[William Sharp Macleay]] (1792–1865), [[William John Swainson|William Swainson]], and others. The idea was that nature followed a "rule of five" with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] (1803–1873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex "maps" of affinities in works by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite journal|author=O’Hara, Robert J.|year=1988|title=Diagrammatic classifications of birds, 1819–1901: views of the natural system in 19th-century British ornithology|pages=2746–2759 |journal=Acta XIX Congressus Internationalis Ornithologici|url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1988-ioc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1975|isbn=978-0-674-64485-4|author=Stresemann, Erwin|title=Ornithology.

The [[Galapagos]] [[finch]]es were especially influential in the development of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. His contemporary [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] also noted these variations and the geographical separations between different forms leading to the study of [[biogeography]]. Wallace was influenced by the work of [[Philip Lutley Sclater]] on the distribution patterns of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sclater, P.

For Darwin, the problem was how species arose from a common ancestor, but he did not attempt to find rules for delineation of species. The [[species problem]] was tackled by the ornithologist [[Ernst Mayr]], who was able to demonstrate that geographical isolation and the accumulation of genetic differences led to the splitting of species.&lt;ref name=konishi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Konishi, Masakazu |author2=Emlen, Stephen T. |author3=Ricklefs, Robert E. |author4=Wingfield, John C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989|title=Contributions of Bird Studies to Biology|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4929|pages=465–472|doi=10.1126/science.2683069|pmid=2683069|bibcode = 1989Sci...246..465K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ornithology and the genesis of the Synthetic Theory of Evolution|last=Junker|first=Thomas|journal=Avian Science|volume=3|issue=2&amp;3|pages=65–73|year=2003|url=http://www.thomas-junker.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/03tjas.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early ornithologists were preoccupied with matters of species identification. Only systematics counted as true science and field studies were considered inferior through much of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=haffer/&gt; In 1901, [[Robert Ridgway]] wrote in the introduction to ''The Birds of North and Middle America'' that:
{{quote|There are two essentially different kinds of ornithology: systematic or scientific, and popular. The former deals with the structure and classification of birds, their synonymies, and technical descriptions. The latter treats of their habits, songs, nesting, and other facts pertaining to their life histories.}}
This early idea that the study of living birds was merely recreation held sway until ecological theories became the predominant focus of ornithological studies.&lt;ref name=mayr/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The study of birds in their habitats was particularly advanced in Germany with [[bird ringing]] stations established as early as 1903. By the 1920s, the ''Journal für Ornithologie'' included many papers on the behaviour, ecology, anatomy, and physiology, many written by [[Erwin Stresemann]]. Stresemann changed the editorial policy of the journal, leading both to a unification of field and laboratory studies and a shift of research from museums to universities.&lt;ref name=haffer&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archives of Natural History|volume=35|issue=1|pages=76–87|year=2008|title=The origin of modern ornithology in Europe|author=Haffer, J.|doi=10.3366/E0260954108000077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornithology in the United States continued to be dominated by museum studies of morphological variations, species identities, and geographic distributions, until it was influenced by Stresemann's student Ernst Mayr.&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barrow, Mark V.|year=1998|title=A passion for birds: American ornithology after Audubon|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, some of the earliest ornithological works that used the word ecology appeared in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander, H. G.|year=1915|title=A Practical Study of Bird Ecology|journal=British Birds|volume=8|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ibis'', however, resisted the introduction of these new methods of study, and  no paper on ecology appeared until 1943.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The work of [[David Lack]] on population ecology was pioneering. Newer quantitative approaches were introduced for the study of ecology and behaviour, and this was not readily accepted. For instance, [[Claud Ticehurst]] wrote:
{{quote|Sometimes it seems that elaborate plans and statistics are made to prove what is commonplace knowledge to the mere collector, such as that hunting parties often travel more or less in circles.|Ticehurst&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt;}}
David Lack's studies on population ecology sought to find the processes involved in the regulation of population based on the evolution of optimal clutch sizes. He concluded that population was regulated primarily by [[Density-dependent inhibition|density-dependent controls]], and also suggested that natural selection produces life-history traits that maximize the fitness of individuals. Others, such as [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards|Wynne-Edwards]], interpreted population regulation as a mechanism that aided the [[Group selection|"species" rather than individuals]]. This led to widespread and sometimes bitter debate on what constituted the "unit of selection".&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; Lack also pioneered the use of many new tools for ornithological research, including the idea of using [[Radar ornithology|radar]] to study bird migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lack, David|year=1959|title=Watching migration by Radar|url=https://www.britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/article_files/V52/V52_N08/V52_N08_P258_267_A056.pdf|journal=British Birds|volume=52|issue=8|pages=258–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds were also widely used in studies of the niche hypothesis and [[Georgii Gause]]'s [[competitive exclusion]] principle. Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by [[Robert MacArthur]]. Patterns of [[biodiversity]] also became a topic of interest. Work on the relationship of the number of species to area and its application in the study of [[island biogeography]] was pioneered by [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Robert MacArthur]].&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; These studies led to the development of the discipline of [[landscape ecology]].

The study of imprinting behaviour in ducks and geese by [[Konrad Lorenz]] and the studies of instinct in [[European herring gull|herring gull]]s by [[Nicolaas Tinbergen]] led to the establishment of the field of [[ethology]]. The study of learning became an area of interest and the study of [[Birdsong|bird songs]] has been a model for studies in neuroethology. The study of hormones and physiology in the control of behaviour has also been aided by bird models. These have helped in finding the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate causes]] of circadian and seasonal cycles. Studies on migration have attempted to answer questions on the evolution of migration, orientation, and navigation.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The growth of genetics and the rise of molecular biology led to the application of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] to explain avian phenomena. Studies on kinship and altruism, such as [[helpers at the nest|helpers]], became of particular interest. The idea of [[inclusive fitness]] was used to interpret observations on behaviour and life history, and birds were widely used models for testing hypotheses based on theories postulated by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The new tools of molecular biology changed the study of bird systematics, which changed from being based on [[phenotype]] to the underlying [[genotype]]. The use of techniques such as [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by [[Charles Sibley]] and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist]], resulting in what is called the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences and [[molecular phylogenetics]] approaches that make use of computational procedures for [[sequence alignment]], construction of [[phylogenetic tree]]s, and calibration of [[molecular clock]]s to infer evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Hara, Robert J.|year=1991|title=Essay review of Phylogeny and Classification of Birds: A Study in Molecular Evolution by Charles G.

[[File:VillageBirdsFlorenceMerriam.jpg|thumb|Page from an early field guide by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey]]]]
The rise of field guides for the identification of birds was another major innovation. The early guides such as those of [[History of British Birds|Thomas Bewick (two volumes)]] and [[History of British Birds (1843)|William Yarrell (three volumes)]] were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of field guides was prepared by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]], sister of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]], the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series ''Hints to Audubon Workers:Fifty Birds and How to Know Them'' in Grinnell's ''[[Audubon Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt; These were followed by new field guides including classics by [[Roger Tory Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunlap, Tom|title=Tom Dunlap on Early Bird Guides.

The interest in [[birdwatching]] grew in popularity in many parts of the world, and the possibility for amateurs to contribute to biological studies was soon realized. As early as 1916, [[Julian Huxley]] wrote a two-part article in ''[[The Auk]]'', noting the tensions between amateurs and professionals, and suggested the possibility that the "vast army of bird lovers and bird watchers could begin providing the data scientists needed to address the fundamental problems of biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 1)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=2|pages=142–161|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n02/p0142-p0161.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072162|jstor=4072162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 2)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=3|pages=256–270|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n03/p0256-p0270.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072322|jstor=4072322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations were started in many countries, and these grew rapidly in membership, most notable among them being the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) in Britain and the [[Audubon Society]] in the US, which started in 1885. Both these organizations were started with the primary objective of conservation. The RSPB, born in 1889, grew from a small group of women in [[Croydon]], who met regularly and called themselves the "Fur, Fin, and Feather Folk" and who took a pledge "to refrain from wearing the feathers of any birds not killed for the purpose of food, the ostrich only exempted." The organization did not allow men as members initially, avenging a policy of the British Ornithologists' Union to keep out women.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt; Unlike the RSPB, which was primarily conservation oriented, the British Trust for Ornithology was started in 1933 with the aim of advancing ornithological research. Members were often involved in collaborative ornithological projects. These projects have resulted in atlases which detail the distribution of bird species across Britain.&lt;ref name=bibby2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibby, C.J.|year=2003|title=Fifty years of Bird Study: Capsule Field ornithology is alive and well, and in the future can contribute much more in Britain and elsewhere|journal=Bird Study|volume=50|issue=3|pages=194–210|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bto/bird/2003/00000050/00000003/art00001|doi=10.1080/00063650309461314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Breeding Bird Surveys, conducted by the US Geological Survey, have also produced atlases with information on breeding densities and changes in the density and distribution over time. Other volunteer collaborative ornithology projects were subsequently established in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/|title=North American Breeding Bird Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
The tools and techniques of ornithology are varied, and new inventions and approaches are quickly incorporated. The techniques may be broadly dealt under the categories of those that are applicable to specimens and those that are used in the field, but the classification is rough and many analysis techniques are usable both in the laboratory and field or may require a combination of field and laboratory techniques.

===Collections===
{{main|Bird collections}}
[[File:Godwit prep.jpg|thumb|left|Bird-preservation techniques]]
The earliest approaches to modern bird study involved the collection of eggs, a practice known as [[oology]]. While collecting became a pastime for many amateurs, the labels associated with these early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study of bird breeding. To preserve eggs, a tiny hole was made and the contents extracted. This technique became standard with the invention of the blow drill around 1830.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt; Egg collection is no longer popular; however, historic museum collections have been of value in determining the effects of [[pesticide]]s such as [[DDT]] on physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, I.|year=1979|title=Population ecology of raptors|isbn=978-0856610233|publisher=T. &amp; A.

[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|Morphometric measurements of birds are important in systematics.]]
The use of bird skins to document species has been a standard part of systematic ornithology. Bird skins are prepared by retaining the key bones of the wings, legs, and skull along with the skin and feathers. In the past, they were treated with [[arsenic]] to prevent fungal and insect (mostly [[Dermestidae|dermestid]]) attack. Arsenic, being toxic, was replaced by less-toxic [[borax]]. Amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending in their skins to museums, some of them from distant locations. This led to the formation of huge collections of bird skins in museums in Europe and North America. Many private collections were also formed. These became references for comparison of species, and the ornithologists at these museums were able to compare species from different locations, often places that they themselves never visited. [[Morphometrics]] of these skins, particularly the lengths of the tarsus, bill, tail, and wing became important in the descriptions of bird species. These skin collections have been used in more recent times for studies on [[molecular phylogenetics]] by the extraction of [[ancient DNA]]. The importance of [[biological type|type specimens]] in the description of species make skin collections a vital resource for systematic ornithology. However, with the rise of molecular techniques,  establishing the taxonomic status of new discoveries, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (''Laniarius liberatus'', no longer a valid species) and the [[Bugun liocichla]] (''Liocichla bugunorum''), using blood, DNA and feather samples as the [[holotype]] material, has now become possible.

Other methods of preservation include the storage of specimens in spirit. Such wet specimens have special value in physiological and anatomical study, apart from providing better quality of DNA for molecular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Livezey, Bradley C.|year=2003|title=Avian spirit collections: attitudes, importance and prospects|journal=Bull. B. O. C.|volume=123A|pages=35–51 |url=http://www.carnegiemnh.net/birds/Livezey%20(2003).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeze drying]] of specimens is another technique that has the advantage of preserving stomach contents and anatomy, although it tends to shrink, making it less reliable for morphometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Winker, K.|year=1993|title=Specimen shrinkage in Tennessee warblers and Traill's flycatchers|journal=J.

===In the field===
The study of birds in the field was helped enormously by improvements in optics. Photography made it possible to document birds in the field with great accuracy. High-power spotting scopes today allow observers to detect minute morphological differences that were earlier possible only by examination of the specimen "in the hand".&lt;ref name="shorebirds"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hayman, Peter |author2=Marchant, John |author3=Prater, Tony  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1986|title=Shorebirds: An Identification Guide to the Waders of the World|isbn=978-0395602379|publisher=Croom Helm, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monitoreo de Aves a Largo Plazo.jpg|thumb|A researcher measures a wild woodpecker.  The bird's right leg has a metal identification tag.]]
The bird in the hand may be examined and [[morphometrics|measurements]] can be made, including standard lengths and weights. Feather moult and skull ossification provide indications of age and health. Sex can be determined by examination of anatomy in some sexually nondimorphic species. Blood samples may be drawn to determine hormonal conditions in studies of physiology, identify DNA markers for studying genetics and kinship in studies of breeding biology and phylogeography. Blood may also be used to identify pathogens and [[arthropod-borne virus]]es. [[Ectoparasite]]s may be collected for studies of coevolution and [[zoonoses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walther, B. A.  |author2=Clayton, D.

Field-identifiable marks such as coloured bands, wing tags, or dyes enable short-term studies where individual identification is required. [[Mark and recapture]] techniques make [[demographic]] studies possible. Ringing has traditionally been used in the study of migration. In recent times, satellite transmitters provide the ability to track migrating birds in near-real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4512291|author1=Marion, W. R.  |author2=Shamis, J.

===In the laboratory===
Many aspects of bird biology are difficult to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration of access to the bird. Nondestructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes establishing the origins of migrant birds possible using [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] analysis of feather samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hobson, K.

Studies in bird behaviour include the use of tamed and trained birds in captivity. Studies on [[bird intelligence]] and [[bird vocalization#Learning|song learning]] have been largely laboratory-based.

The chicken has long been a [[model organism]] for studying vertebrate [[developmental biology]]. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike [[house mouse|mice]]).

"Kabazzah" is a variant technique that originates from [[South Asia]], where the female additionally uses her [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal]] [[muscle]] contractions to stimulate the [[penis]] of the male partner, who must remain totally passive.

The act itself is a variety of [[tantra]], its purpose being to enhance and increase the duration and intensity of intercourse. The word translates as 'holder', and the sensation can be likened to that of 'milking'.&lt;ref&gt;Kick, Russ, ed.

'''Positivistic animism''' [[hypothesis]] states that some [[animism|animistic]] [[memes]] belonging to determined [[culture]] and [[natural environment]] can be confirmed by [[positivism]]. These memes are therefore called positivistic animistic memes and can easily evolve towards [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] within the structure of simple and new [[memeplexes]], if dissociated from the original [[memeplex]].

The distinction between positivistic animistic memes and non positivistic [[animistic]] memes can only be done through scientific experimentation.

The main hypothesis for this theory is that there is the possibility that local animistic cultures carry memes that have positivistic properties.

Following this hypothesis, the following premises for the postulated theory are:

In a determined culture, local animism has memes that replicate knowledge gathered through trial and error over millennia – i.e. positivistic memes – these memes are by definition scientifically acquired and provable for that determined environment.

Modern science can study animistic practices and replicable components (memes) of a determined culture – it is possible to extricate animistic memes, and distinguish which ones are possible to prove scientifically, thus are positivistic memes for that specific local environment and which memes are purely derived from mysticism or have been carried in from different environments.

As conclusion, by extricate animistic memes from local memeplexes and disseminate the positivistic animistic memes associated to different and simple memeplexes, it is possible to act as an evolutionary force over the memes and memeplex.

If the theory is right, the dissemination of Positivistic Animism Memes will be done at minimum cost and effort and will facilitate the assimilation of memeplexes that are exterior to the culture as there is cultural ownership and identity over some memes that are part of the new memeplex. This theory provides a way of replacing obsolete memeplexes that hinder de development of society in the new globalised world. However, and because it requires the thorough and systematic study of culture and its memeplexes, will always store the information that these obsolete memeplexes contain.

Possible applications of positivistic animism:

If proven true, this theory can have applications in a wide range of natural and social sciences, and can be an interface between a scientific elite and illiterate populations. This theory can also prevent the loss of ancient positivistic knowledge and preserve live cultures in face of globalization.

For example, the application of this theory can foster a strong cultural sense that is likely to be both environmental sensitive and sustainably reproduced.

As most indigenous cultures nowadays are under enormous pressure of [[globalization]], the Positivistic Animist Theory can give a way to preserve positivistic cultural elements alive in cultures. The study and recording of all components of culture, positivistic or not, is nevertheless of the utmost importance, as the positivistic properties are specific for a time and a place.

This theory is still in its phase of inception and has not being proved. The first step to test this theory is the identification of local animistic memes in a determined culture, and test if these memes are positivistic or not. The memes found positivistic can be then disseminated through communication channels and its acceptance in local culture should be tracked.

== History ==

PIRLS &lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt; provides internationally comparative data on how well children read by assessing students’ reading achievement. PIRLS collects considerable background information on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. These background data include information about the following: national curriculum policies in reading; how the education system is organized to facilitate learning; students’ home environment for learning; school climate and resources; and how instruction actually occurs in classrooms. Studies of reading literacy had been conducted prior to the PIRLS study of 2001, and PIRLS is the successor to IEA studies, such as the Reading Literacy Study, that started in 1970 and continued until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/other-iea-studies|title=Other IEA studies - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIRLS study of 2001 started the trend for cyclical testing; PIRLS has a frequency of five years.  By administering the test every five years, education systems are able to monitor their children's literacy achievement over time.  The current cycle, PIRLS 2016, is the fourth cycle of the IEA PIRLS. Like the previous PIRLS cycles (conducted in 2001, 2006, and 2011), the study will also collect extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country.&lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt;

== Cycles ==

===PIRLS 2001===

The IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2001 was the first cycle of assessments to measure trends in children's reading literacy achievement, and policy and practices related to literacy. The study examined three aspects of reading literacy: processes of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading literacy behavior and attitudes. 35 countries took part in the first cycle where students enrolled in the fourth grade were assessed.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/pirls-past-cycles|title=PIRLS - Past Cycles - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2006===

PIRLS 2006 assessed a range of reading comprehension strategies for two major reading purposes: literary and informational. The student test of reading comprehension addressed four processes:

* retrieval of explicitly stated information
* making straightforward inferences
* interpreting and integrating ideas and information
* examination and evaluation of content, language, and textual elements.
For the second cycle of the study 41 countries participated assessing students of grade four. PIRLS 2006 assessed students enrolled in the fourth grade.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2011===

Combining newly developed reading assessment passages and questions for 2011 with a selection of secure assessment passages and questions from 2001 and 2006, the study offered a state-of-the-art assessment of reading comprehension that allowed for measurement of changes since 2001. The international population for PIRLS 2011 consisted of students in the grade that represents four years of schooling, provided that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In the 2011 cycle, prePIRLS (now known as PIRLS Literacy) was offered to assess basic reading skills as a bridge to PIRLS, for countries where most children are still developing fundamental reading skills at the end of the primary school cycle.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2016===

PIRLS 2016 was released on December 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/ |title=PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collects extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country. In this cycle there were two additional initiatives: 
(1) the PIRLS Literacy assessment (earlier known as prePIRLS) is equivalent to PIRLS in scope and reflects the same conception of reading as PIRLS. Its purpose is to extend the effective measurement of reading literacy at the lower end of the achievement scale. Countries whose fourth-grade students are still developing fundamental reading skills can participate in the PIRLS Literacy assessment and still have their results reported on the PIRLS achievement scale. The reading passages and questions in common between the PIRLS Literacy and the PIRLS assessments will enable the two assessments to be linked, and their results to be compared.
(2) Initiated in 2016, ePIRLS is a computer-based reading assessment of students’ ability to acquire and use information when reading online. The assessment encompasses an engaging, simulated internet environment with authentic school-like assignments about science and social studies topics. The ePIRLS online reading achievement scale enables countries to examine their fourth-graders’ online reading performance relative to their performance on the PIRLS reading achievement scales.

In terms of trends, the PIRLS results for student achievement by country states that 18 countries had higher average achievement, 13 countries had the same average achievement, and 10 countries had lower average achievement; and girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 48 0f the 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ |title= PIRLS 2016 International results in reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/trends-in-reading-achievement/ |title=Trends in reading results by country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia has the Education Policy and Curriculum in Reading by country. It describes the structure of each education system, the reading curricula in the primary grades, and overall policies related to reading instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/ |title=2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten countries with the highest average reading achievement were: Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipie, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ | title= PIRLS 2016 Student Achievement Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2021===

[http://www.iea.nl/pirls-next-cycle PIRLS 2021] will be the fifth cycle in the PIRLS framework. IEA's PIRLS will continue to collect considerable background information from the assessed students, their parents, teachers and school principals on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students, as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. Trend results across assessments permit countries to monitor the effectiveness of their educational systems in a global context, and PIRLS 2021 marks 20 years of trends.

PIRLS 2021 evolves further from PIRLS 2016 in allowing countries to administer the full PIRLS reading assessment, including both PIRLS Informational and Literary (the previous standard PIRLS assessment), and the ePIRLS Online Informational (the previous ePIRLS), as one seamless digitally based endeavour. Countries may also select from two levels of the PIRLS assessment; providing students with an assessment experience better suited to their reading abilities increases student motivation and provides more accurate assessment data. All results will be reported on the same PIRLS achievement scale.

PIRLS 2021 thus offers three flexible options, enabling participants to select the administration path best suited to assessing their education system:(1) A new fully digital ePIRLS assessment, which integrates all aspects of PIRLS Informational, PIRLS Literary, and the ePIRLS Online Informational assessments; 2) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, which is equivalent to the original pen-and-paper PIRLS standard assessment; and (3) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, taken together with the ePIRLS Online Informational assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/publications/Electronic_versions/PIRLS%202021%20Brochure.pdf |title=Info |website=www.iea.nl |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PIRLS assessment ==

The PIRLS study consists of a main survey that consists of a written reading comprehension test and a background questionnaire.  The PIRLS Reading Development Group (RDG) and National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from the participating countries collaborate to develop the reading assessments.  The assessment focuses on three main areas of literacy: process of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading behaviors and attitudes.  The background questionnaire is used to determine the reading behaviors and attitudes.  The written test is designed to address the process of comprehension and the purposes for reading.  There are two purposes for reading that are examined in this study: reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. Each student receives 80 minutes to complete two passages and then time to complete the survey.  There are a total of 8 passage.  Four passages are for each purpose of reading.  "With eight reading passages in total, but just two to be given to any
one student, passages and their accompanying items were assigned to student test booklets according to a matrix sampling plan. The eight passages were distributed across 10 booklets, two per booklet, so that passages were paired together in a booklet in as many different ways as possible."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt; The PIRLS target population is the grade that represents four years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1, which corresponds to the fourth grade in most countries. To better match the assessment to the achievement level of students, countries have the option of administering PIRLS or PIRLS Literacy at the fifth or sixth grade.

== Background questionnaire ==
Given to:

*Home/Parents—This questionnaire includes questions about "students’ early reading experiences, child-parent literacy interactions, parents’ reading habits and attitudes, home-school connections, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators."
*Students—This questionnaire includes questions about "instructional experiences, self-perception and attitudes towards reading, out-of-school reading habits, computer use, home literacy resources, and basic demographic information."
*Teachers—This questionnaire includes questions about "characteristics of the class tested, instructional activities for teaching reading, classroom resources, assessment practices, and about their education, training, and opportunities for professional development."
*Schools—This questionnaire includes questions about "enrollment and school characteristics, school organization for reading instruction, school staffing and resources, home-school connections, and the school environment."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">'''Prolation''' is a term used in the theory of the [[mensural notation]] of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] to describe its rhythmic structure on a small scale, as opposed to ''tempus'', which described a larger scale. The term "prolation" is derived from the Latin ''prolatio'', first used by [[Philippe de Vitry]] in describing [[Ars Nova]], a musical style that came about in 14th-century France.

Prolation, together with tempus, corresponds roughly to the concept of [[time signature]] in modern music. Prolation describes whether a [[semibreve]] (whole note) is equal in length to two [[minim_(music)|minim]]s (half notes) (''minor prolation'' or ''imperfect prolation''; in Latin ''"prolatio minor"'') or three minims (''major prolation'' or ''perfect prolation''; in Latin ''"prolatio maior"''). Tempus similarly describes the relationship between the [[breve]] and [[semibreve]].

Early medieval music was often structured in subdivisions of three, while the [[note value]]s in modern music are unambiguously subdivided into two parts, meaning that only minor prolation has survived in our time signature system. We now indicate subdivisions of three by modifying note values with dots or triplets. The history of written medieval music shows a gradual shift from major to minor prolation being common.

The equivalent term in the [[Music of the Trecento|Italian notation]] of the fourteenth century is ''"divisio"'', which covers both tempus and prolation.  Italian ''divisiones'', first described by [[Marchetto da Padova]], can also allow four minims within a semibreve.  For instance ''octonaria'' and ''duodenaria'' place eight and twelve minims in a breve respectively divided into two or three "major" semibreves.

Different forms of [[School-related gender-based violence|School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV)]] interact and overlap. Bullying, for instance, occurs when there is an imbalance of power between the “bully” and the “bullied” and can happen through physical contact, verbal attacks, social exclusion, and psychological manipulation. Students are bullied when they are repeatedly and intentionally exposed to harmful and/or aggressive behaviour that results in injury or discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246928e.pdf|title=Reaching Out: Preventing and Addressing SOGIE-related School Violence in Viet Nam, volume 2|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=15, 21, 27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global, regional and local research demonstrates that schools and other educational institutions in Viet Nam are not always safe and inclusive spaces for children and young people. Many schools are sites of physical, verbal, psychosocial and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro P. (2006). World Report on Violence against Children.

In 2013 the Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) showed that approximately one in six students, aged 13-17 years, reported being in a physical fight one or more times during the last 12 months, with this behaviour being more common for boys (26%) than girls (10%).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation &amp; Hanoi Medical University.

Viet Nam has also had some research studies about violence against LGBT students, including a field survey carried out by CCIHP with 520 LGBT people with the average age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, S. L., &amp; D’Augelli, A. R. (1995). The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. Developmental Psychology, 31, 65–74. &lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that 41% of LGBT participants suffered from discrimination and violence in either schools or universities. [[Save the Children]] Vietnam and the Institute of Social and Medical Studies completed a separate study on 170 LGBT young adults which found that discrimination against these children (at home and school) contributed to their increased risk of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children. (2015). Child Rights Situation Analysis. Ha Noi: Viet Nam Country Office. &lt;/ref&gt; They were at high risk of violence at home, school and on the streets. Only 15.9% of the LGBT youth participants had a post-secondary school education, 47.8% had only a lower secondary education, 27.6% had only a primary school education, and 8.7% had no schooling at all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One study conducted by the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE) involving 2,363 respondents from 63 provinces in Viet Nam found that one in three respondents felt that they had been subject to discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity within 12 months preceding the survey, with a high degree of frequency.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Luong,T.H.,&amp;Pham,Q,P.(2015).Is it because I am LGBT?: Discriminations on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Vietnam. Ha Noi: The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment. &lt;/ref&gt; The study also reported that transgender people experience the highest degree of discrimination. This study focused its analysis on the discrimination experienced by LGBT people in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings and housing, among other aspects. Looking specifically at the school setting, the study found that nearly a quarter of students had been harassed, bullied by teachers and/or school officials because they were considered to be LGBT. Gender indicative uniforms proved to be a significant obstacle for transgender people, affecting their quality of learning and their mental health. In light of the findings, some recommendations specific to the education sector included: 1) School psychological counseling models need to pre-empt the psychological and physical development of students to provide well-timed educational support; 2) Create extracurricular programs that respond to the needs of students; 3) Respect students’ choice of uniform to fit with their desired gender and; 4) Educate faculties about the LGBT community.

[[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]] Viet Nam, in cooperation with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), [[Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents]] [[(CSAGA)]], and the [[International Center for Research on Women|International Centre for Research on Women]] (ICRW), has implemented a “Gender Responsive School Pilot Model project” meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received group counselling. The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.&lt;ref&gt;Plan International Viet Nam.

The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality was approved for the period 2011-2020 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socio-economic development of the country, including in education efforts towards this end. Furthermore, unlike many of its neighbours, Viet Nam now no longer has a ban on same-sex marriage, and has indeed never had punitive laws around either male or female same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, R. (2015). Vietnam Removes Same-Sex Marriage Ban. Metro Weekly. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/01/&lt;/nowiki&gt; vietnam-removes-same-sex-marriage- &lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Viet Nam passed a landmark law by a vote of 282-84 in 2015 enshrining transgender people’s right to legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their sex rights for transgender people and paving the way to allow those who have undergone gender reassignment to register their legal identity under their new sex.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45418">'''Sex in advertising''' is the use of [[sex appeal]] in [[advertising]] to help sell a particular product or service. According to research, sexually appealing imagery does not need to pertain to the product or service in question. A few examples of sexually appealing imagery include [[nudity]], [[pin-up model]]s, and muscular men. "Sex sells" became a controversial issue, with techniques for enlarging and titillating the audience challenging conventional moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dawn Blair, et al., "Ethics in advertising: sex sells, but should it?." ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues'' 9.1/2 (2006): 109+.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary mainstream advertising (e.g., magazines, online, television), sex is present in promotional messages for a wide range of branded goods. Ads often feature provocative images of well-defined women (and men) in revealing outfits and postures selling things such as clothing, alcohol, beauty products, and fragrances. Advertisers such as Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret, and Pepsi (just to name a few) use these images to cultivate a sexy media presence. Also, sexual information is used to promote mainstream products not traditionally associated with sex. For example, [[Dallas Opera]]'s recent reversal of its declining ticket sales has been attributed to the marketing of the more lascivious parts of its performances.&lt;ref&gt;Chism, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex in advertising research: A review of content, effects, and functions of sexual information in consumer advertising|year=2002|pages=241–73|journal=Annu. Rev. Sex Res.|volume=13|author=Tom Reichert|pmid=12836733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of sex in advertising can be highly overt or extremely subtle and, on some level, subliminal. It ranges from relatively explicit displays of sexual acts and seductive behavior aimed at the viewer, to the use of double-meanings and underlying sexual references that are more subconscious. Sex in advertising relies on evolutionary processes and varies in effectiveness depending on the culture and gender of the receiver. The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to objectify the female body and emphasizing various stereotypes.

==Concept==
''Gender Advertisements'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goffman |first1=Erving |title=Gender Advertisements |date=March 1, 1979 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0060906332 |pages=84 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1979 book by Canadian social anthropologist, [[Erving Goffman]] is series of studies of visual communication and how gender representation in advertising communicates subtle, underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising. The book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising and the differences, as well as the symbolism implied in the depictions of men and women in advertising.

When couples are used in an advertisement, the sex-roles played by each also send out messages. The interaction of the couple may send out a message of relative dominance and power, and may stereotype the roles of one or both partners. Usually the message is very subtle, and sometimes advertisements attract interest by changing stereotypical roles. For example, companies including [[Spotify]], [[AirBnB]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] have used same-sex couples in adverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=13 amazing adverts featuring same-sex couples|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/13/13-amazing-adverts-featuring-same-sex-couples/|website=PinkNews|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These adverts appeal to same-sex couples; and they also create the image that these companies are tolerant and allow them to appeal to a wider consumer audience.

As many consumers and professionals think, sex is used to grab a viewer's attention but this is a short-term success. Whether using sex in advertising is effective depends on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2008/03/does-sex-in-adv.html|title=DOES SEX IN ADVERTISING WORK?|publisher=Branding Strategy Insider|accessdate=2015-03-31|date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About three-quarters of advertisements using sex to sell the product are communicating a product-related benefit, such as the product making its users more sexually attractive. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Types==

===Physical attractiveness===
The use of physically attractive models in advertising is a form of sex in advertising. Physical attractiveness can be conveyed through facial beauty, physique, hair, skin complexion as well as by the model's inferred personality. This form of sex in advertising is effective as it draws attention and influences the overall feeling of the ad. Furthermore, such ads create an association between physical attractiveness and the product which sends a message to the consumer buying it that they will help them achieve that physique.&lt;ref name="Reichert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reichert|first1=Tom|title=Sex in advertising: Perspectives on the erotic appeal|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|pages=11–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[sexual arousal]] possibly elicited by physical attractiveness in adverts is thought to transfer onto the advertised product.&lt;ref name="AABerger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Arthur Asa|title=Ads, fads and Consumer culture|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=99–120|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual behaviour===
Marketers often use tactics such as using sexual imagery in their advertisements to capture the consumer's attention for longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Sengupta &amp; Vohs (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Sex in advertising is also incorporated using hints of [[sexual behaviour]]. The latter is communicated by the models using flirtatious [[body language]], open posture and making eye contact with the viewer. Sexual behaviour can also be displayed using several models interacting in a more or less sexual way. Sexual behaviour in advertising is used to arouse sexual interest from the viewer.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt; Research has shown that sexual arousal elicited by an advert subsequently affects the overall ad evaluation and the chances of future purchase.&lt;ref name="AABerger" /&gt;

For example, in a Guess clothing advert, while the models are physically attractive, it is their behavior such as position, posture and facial expressions that communicate sexual interest to the viewer. Women are often shown as being shorter, put in the background of images, shown in more ‘feminine’ poses than men, and generally present a higher degree of ‘body display’ than men in print advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotos|first=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction:  An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual referents===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VW topless.png|thumb|282x282px|Volkswagen advert for the "topless" Beetle Cabriolet]] --&gt;
Sexual referents are a more implicit example of sex in advertising. Sex can be invoked in advertising using sexual double entendre or innuendos. The latter rely on the viewer to interpret them. They can be words or images that while not being explicitly sexual, trigger sexual thoughts from the viewer. Elements such as lighting, music, models’ behaviour and camera effects can contribute towards communicating implicit sexual meaning. Sexual referents are a powerful tool as they drive viewers to create sexual thoughts and interpretations of the product.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

While sexual referents are an implicit use of sex in advertising, as there may be nothing overtly sexual about them, they are placed by advertisers in the aim that viewers will interpret them as sexual.

An example of sexual referents is [[Volkswagen]]'s campaign for the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] Cabriolet. The advert pixelates the non-existent roof to the car, similar to the pixilation that occurs when female's breasts are exposed in some forms of media. Volkswagen have a history of producing tongue-in-cheek adverts, and this one serves to compare their new convertible to a woman who goes topless at a beach. It implies the car is relaxed and fun, like someone who goes topless at a beach.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Super chocolate cake vagina Moist.jpg|left|thumb|168x168px|Betty Crocker cake mix advert using sexual embed technique]] --&gt;

===Sexual embeds===
Sexual embeds are a controversial form of sex in advertising. They are a powerful technique that advertising agencies do not want consumers to consciously notice. They are [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] elements that are detected as sexual information solely at the subconscious level. Sexual embeds can take the form of objects or words that, at the subconscious level (or when occasionally consciously identified) explicitly depict sexual acts or genitalia. For example, a perfume bottle could mimic a phallic shape and its positioning could suggest sexual intercourse. Embeds are especially effective as they unconsciously trigger sexual arousal in the consumer which drives motivation and goal directed behaviour such as purchase intention.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

An example of this technique is a particular cake mix advertisement from [[Betty Crocker]] in which it would appear the chocolate icing on the heel of the cake has been painted to look like [[female genitalia]]. Amongst millions who viewed the commercial, very few will have noticed anything unusual; however, while this detail might not have been consciously perceived, it would have been interpreted sexually at the [[subconscious]] level. This advertisement, directed at women, puts an emphasis on the [[sense of touch]] by using words such as "moist", and on the whole the ad creates a subconscious association between the product and [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

===Gender roles===
After women achieved the vote in the United States, Britain and Canada in the 1920s, advertising agencies exploited the new status of women. For example, they associated driving an automobile with masculinity, power, control, and dominance over a beautiful woman sitting alongside. More subtly, they published automobile ads in women's magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were in fact men.  The new ads promoted themes of women's liberation while also delineating the limits of this freedom. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility and modernity.  The ads offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einav | first1 = Rabinovitch-Fox | year = 2016 | title = Baby, You Can Drive My Car: Advertising Women's Freedom in 1920s America | url = | journal = American Journalism | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 372–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary theory ==
[[File:AN Aurora Jolie 1.jpg|thumb|209x209px|An example of a product being paired with sexual imagery to create an association between the two. The logo of the product this model is promoting is printed on the [[pasties]] (on her breasts).]]
Research into evolution explains the use of sex in advertising and the differences between genders, due to different [[Mating strategy|mating strategies]]. It is the biological prerogative of the male to reproduce with as many females as possible, as this increases his chances of producing [[offspring]]. Because of this need to reproduce as much as possible, males search for cues which signal females are available and accessible, such as seductive behaviour, as well as cues that indicate good health, including facial symmetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill &amp; Gangstead|year=1996|title=The evolution of human sexuality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49758142|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=11|issue=2|pages=98–102|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81051-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shiny hair and firm breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havlíček |first=Jan|display-authors=etal |year=2016|title=Men's preferences for women's breast size and shape in four cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816302847|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=In Press|issue=2|pages=217–226|via=|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers can use these findings to help create an association between their product and the males needs by pairing the two.

Evolutionary research into female sex strategies show that women are more concerned about long term prospects and mates resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss |first=D |last2=Schmitt |first2=D.|year=1993|title=Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100.2|issue=2|pages=204–232|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and less interested in typical male requirements of good health and accessibility. This explains why sexually explicit adverts tend to be directed at male consumers, whereas products aimed at a female market typically involve romantic imagery, and males who are wealthy, intelligent or powerful.

==History==
{{main|History of advertising}}
The earliest known use of sex in advertising is by the Pearl Tobacco brand in 1871, which featured a naked maiden on the package cover. In 1885, W. Duke &amp; Sons inserted trading cards into cigarette packs that featured sexually provocative starlets. Duke grew to become the leading American cigarette brand by 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|320x320px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal''  version of the famous seduction-based ad by [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency]] Other early forms of sex appeal in advertising include woodcuts and illustrations of attractive women (often unclothed from the waist up) adorning posters, signs, and ads for [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s, [[patent medicine|tonic]]s, and [[tobacco]]. In several notable cases, sex in advertising has been claimed as the reason for increased consumer interest and sales.

===Sex and soap===
[[Woodbury's Facial Soap]], a woman's beauty bar, was almost discontinued in 1911. The soap's sales decline was reversed, however, with ads containing images of romantic couples and promises of love and intimacy for those using the brand.&lt;ref&gt;''Account Histories'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Jovan Musk Oil, introduced in 1971, was promoted with sexual entendre and descriptions of the fragrance's sexual attraction properties. As a result, Jovane, Inc.'s revenue grew from $1.5 million in 1971 to $77 million by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan &amp; Millman, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===KamaSutra condoms in India===
In 1991, J.K. Chemicals Group asked the [[Bombay]] office of Lintas Bombay to develop a campaign for a new [[condom]] brand. The problem was that in the late 1940s, the [[Nehru]] government had launched a major population limitation program to reduce India's birthrate. The program was very heavy-handed, using coercion, and demanding that men use condoms.  The product therefore signified an oppressive governmental intrusion.  The agency head hit on the idea of a pleasurable condom, "So when the user hears the brand name, he says, "Wow. It's a turn on. Not a turn off."  A brainstorming session hit on the name "[[KamaSutra (brand)|KamaSutra]]", which refers to [[Kama Sutra|an ancient Sanskrit treatise on lovemaking]] and the sculptures at temples that illustrate the positions involved.  The term was known to well-educated Indians, and that was the intended audience.  Correctly predicting the huge impact the ad campaign would have, the agency purchased all the advertising space in the popular glamour magazine ''[[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]]'' and filled it with erotic images of [[Bollywood]] actors and actresses promoting KamaSutra condoms. A television commercial followed featuring a steamy shower scene. The television ad was censored but the print campaign proved highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William M. | year = 2008 | title = Advertising in India | url = | journal = Advertising &amp; Society Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mazzarella, ''Shoveling Smoke: Advertising and Globalization in Contemporary India'' (Duke University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benetton===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Priest Benetton Nun.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Nun and Priest kissing in a Benetton United Colours advert]] --&gt;
The Italian clothing company [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention in the late 20th century for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' (2007) pp 146–49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brooke shields calvin klein jeans.jpg|left|thumb|268x268px|Calvin Klein advert featuring Brooke Shields]] --&gt;

===Calvin Klein - sex and jeans===
[[Calvin Klein]] of '''Calvin Klein [[Jeans]]''' has been at the forefront of this movement to use sex in advertising, having claimed, "Jeans are about sex. The abundance of bare flesh is the last gasp of advertisers trying to give redundant products a new identity." Calvin Klein's first controversial jeans advertisement showed a 15-year-old [[Brooke Shields]], in Calvin Klein jeans, saying, "Do you want to know what gets between me and my Calvins? Nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sischy |first=Ingrid |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/04/calvin200804?currentPage=7 |title=Vanity Fair Calvin Klein |publisher=Vanityfair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calvin Klein]] has also received media attention for its controversial advertisements in the mid-1990s. Several of Calvin Klein's advertisements featured images of teenage models, some "who were reportedly as young as 15" in overly sexual and provocative poses.&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm Calvin Klein: A Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521174126/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm |date=2012-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Klein insisted that these advertisements were not pornographic, some considered the campaign as a form of "[[soft porn]]" or "[[kiddie porn]]" that was exploitative, shocking, and suggestive. In 1999, Calvin Klein was the subject of more controversy when it aired advertisements of young children who were only wearing the brand's underwear. This "kiddie underwear ad campaign" was pulled only one day after it aired as a result of public outlash.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Robert. [http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html "Kiddie Porn" Controversy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074812/http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html |date=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson from Calvin Klein insisted that these ads were intended "to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you find in a family snapshot."&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"/&gt;

==Effectiveness==

===Effective use===
Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm, has reported that in more than 50 years of testing advertising effectiveness, it has found the use of the erotic to be a significantly above-average technique in communicating with the marketplace, "...although one of the more dangerous for the advertiser. Weighted down with taboos and volatile attitudes, sex is a Code Red advertising technique ... handle with care ... seller beware; all of which makes it even more intriguing." This research has led to the popular idea that ''"sex sells"''.&lt;ref name="Sex sells"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession|last=Streitmatter|first=Roger|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing strategies centred around sex have been successful. [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] used sex to market their brand in a variety of ways, including store greeters dressed only in underwear, models working in store and topless models on the bags. Employees were hired based on physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/07/abercrombie-and-fitch-hollister-sexual-marketing/70934572/|title=Cover up! Abercrombie &amp; Fitch says sexual marketing is over|website=USA today|last1=Bowerman|first1=Mary|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was aimed at teenagers and young adults, who are the most impressionable consumer group, and who have vast amounts of disposable money. During the late 1990s, the company produced a magazine/catalogue (magalog), featuring semi-nude or nude models. The magalog was a success, with A&amp;F issuing over 1.5 million copies. Despite being somewhat paradoxical, the use of sexual branding raised their revenue from $85 million in 1993 to $1.35 billion in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Message Communication in Advertising: Selling the Abercrombie and Fitch Image|url=https://www.uwlax.edu/urc/jur-online/PDF/2005/driessen.pdf|journal=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research VIII|last1=Driessen|first1=Claire|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;F have expressed that they will move away from sexual marketing, and focus on showcasing product and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/shirts-boys-abercrombie-says-its-done-sexualized-marketing-164300|title=Shirts on, Boys. Abercrombie Says It's Done With Sexualized Marketing|website=Adweek.com|last1=Monllos|first1=Kristina|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality in advertising is extremely effective at attracting the consumer's attention and once it has their attention, to remember the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=James|last2=McClelland|first2=Alastair|last3=Furnham|first3=Adrian|date=2015-03-01|title=Sex Really Does Sell: The Recall of Sexual and Non-sexual Television Advertisements in Sexual and Non-sexual Programmes|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210–216|doi=10.1002/acp.3095|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solves the greatest problem in advertising of getting the potential buyer to look at and remember the advertisement. However the introduction of attraction and especially sexuality into an ad often distracts from the original message and can cause an adverse effect of the consumer wanting to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6040|title=Sexual Content and Advertising Effectiveness: Comments on Belch Et Al.

=== Ineffective use ===
[[File:1926BestLikedPhotosInTheWorld.jpg|thumb|1926 US advertisement for [[French postcard|"French" postcards]]]]

There are some studies that contradict the theory that sex is an effective tool for improving finances and gathering attention. A study from 2009 found that there was a negative correlation between nudity and sexuality in movies, and box office performance and critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/aca-3-4-200.pdf |title=Sex Doesn't Sell—Nor Impress! Content, Box Office, Critics, and Awards in Mainstream Cinema|date=2009|author=Anemone Cerridwen, Dean Keith Simonton |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 research by MediaAnalyzer has found that less than 10% of men recalled the brand of sexual ads, compared to more than 19% of non sexual ads; a similar result was found in women (10.8% vs. 22.3%). It is hypothesized by that survey, that this is a result of a general numbing caused by over use of [[sexual stimuli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencemarketing.com/2005/10/25/sex-in-ads-does-not-sell/ |title=Sex in ads does not sell |publisher=Emergencemarketing.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in advertising.

In another experimental study conducted on 324 undergraduate college students, [[Brad Bushman]] examined brand recall for neutral, sexual or violent commercials embedded in neutral, sexual or violent TV programs. He found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral TV programs and neutral commercials versus those who saw sexual or violent commercials embedded in sexual or violent TV programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushman|first=Brad|title=That was a great commercial, but what were they selling?

Unless sex is related to the product (such as beauty, health or hygiene products) there is not clear effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/magazine-trends-study-finds-increase-in-advertisements-using-sex/|title=Magazine trends study finds increase in advertisements using sex|date=2012-06-05|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7624485|title=Violence and Sex in Television Programs Do Not Sell Products in Advertisements|date=2012-06-05|publisher=researchgate.net|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using sex may attract one market demographic while repelling another at the same time.  The overt use of sexuality to promote [[breast cancer awareness]], through fundraising campaigns like "I Love Boobies" and "Save the Ta-tas", is effective at reaching younger women, who are at low risk of developing breast cancer, but angers and offends some breast [[cancer survivor]]s and older women, who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/30/patients-decry-sexualization-of-breast-cancer/1630911/ |title=Sexy breast cancer campaigns anger many patients|last=Szabo|first=Lisa|date=30 October 2012 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Recent research indicates that the use of sexual images of females in ads negatively affects women's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-women-sexually-explicit-ads-unappealingunless.html#inlRlv |title=Women find sexually explicit ads unappealing—unless the price is right |publisher=medicalxpress.com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that females were more likely than males to be portrayed as nude, wearing sexual clothing or only a partial amount of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soley|first=Lawrence|year=1986|title=Sex in Advertising: A Comparison of 1964 and 1984 Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=15|issue=3|pages=46–64|via=|doi=10.1080/00913367.1986.10673018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 2013 of how printed ads with sexual content affects women clearly showed that women are not attracted to them except in the case of products being luxurious and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sex-doesnt-sell-this-study-into-womens-response-to-raunchy-advertising-starts-wrong-and-gets-worse-8995776.html |title=Sex doesn't sell? This study into women's response to raunchy advertising starts wrong and gets worse|publisher=www.independent.co.uk |date=2013-12-10 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides alienating women there is a serious risk that the audience in general will reduce support to organisations that uses the sexual images of women without a legitimate reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-12-sex.html |title=Study: Does sex always sell?|publisher=phys.org |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=J|year=2008|title=Gender-related reactions to gratuitous sex appeals in advertising|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Advertising|volume=18|pages=62–78|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2007.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that men have a positive attitude to sexual adverts, whereas women have a negative response to them, this study used an advert with both a male and female. This was thought to be because women had lower average [[sex drive]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s than men. Another theory for this difference is that evolution has led men to seek casual sex, contrary to women who value commitment and intimacy in the context of a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herold|year=1993|title=Gender differences in casual sex and AIDS prevention: A survey of dating bars.|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=30|pages=36–42|via=|doi=10.1080/00224499309551676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adverts sex tends to be represented in its own right and not as part of a relationship leading to the difference in responses. This theory is supported by research which found that women respond less negatively to sexual adverts when it is in the context of gift giving from a man to a women. Therefore, react less negatively when the sexuality of the advert is the context of commitment. Men respond more negatively to the sexual advert when it involves gift giving as it emphasises them having to spend money in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren|year=2009|title=Sex in advertising: Gender differences and the role of relationship commitment|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=36|issue=2|pages=215–231|via=|doi=10.1086/597158|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.2353}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with evolutionary theory that women value men for their resources and men value women for sex and fertility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|year=1989|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=12|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research found that even in men recall of the advert is worsened by sexual content, as they focus on breasts and legs but not on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nudd|year=2005|title=Does sex really sell?|url=|journal=Adweek|volume=46|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
In order to be consistent, brands use standardized campaigns across various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argawal|first=Wadhu|year=1995|title=Review of a 40-year debate in international advertising: Practitioner and academician perspectives to the standardization/adaptation issue|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=12|pages=26–48|doi=10.1108/02651339510080089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural differences have been found in response to sexual adverts. A 2016 study by the Korea Internet Advertising Foundation (KIAF) noted that 94.5% of South Korean high schoolers were familiar with sex-driven ads, 83.4% of adults thought such ads have negative influence on society, and 91.2% said there are too many of such ads. A KIAF official noted that government legislation aimed to reduce such ads is not effective due to its ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreabizwire.com/internet-ads-with-sexual-imagery-at-a-critical-level-survey/65968?platform=hootsuite|title=Internet Ads with Sexual Imagery at a Critical Level: Survey {{!}} Be Korea-savvy|website=koreabizwire.com|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has found that sex is used in adverts more in [[France]] than in the [[United States]] because they are more sexually liberated and so receptive to its use in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biswas|year=1992|title=A comparison of print advertisements from the United States and France|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=21|issue=4|pages=73–81|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In the [[21st century]], the use of increasingly explicit sexual imagery in consumer-oriented print ads have become almost commonplace.  Ads for jeans, [[perfume]]s and many other products have featured provocative images that were designed to elicit sexual responses from as large a cross section of the population as possible, to shock by their ambivalence, or to appeal to repressed sexual desires, which are thought to carry a stronger emotional load.  Increased tolerance, more tempered censorship, emancipatory developments and increasing buying power of previously neglected appreciative target groups in rich markets (mainly in the West) have led to a marked increase in the share of attractive flesh 'on display'.

''[[Advertising Age|Ad Age]]'', a magazine delivering news, analysis, and data on marketing and media, published a list of Top 100 most effective advertising of the century, out of the 100, only 8 involved use of sex.&lt;ref name=Garfield&gt;{{cite news |author=Garfield, Bob |date=29 March 1999 |title=Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the Century |url=http://adage.com/century/campaigns.html |newspaper=Ad Age|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unruly Media's viral video tracker lists the Top-20 most viewed car commercial viral videos. Only 1 uses sex, while the No.1 spot was held by VW's "The Force" ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top-20 most popular car commercials |url=http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/8/17/top-20-most-popular-car-commercials.html |publisher=Unruly Media |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811141649/http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/8/17/top-20-most-popular-car-commercials.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall top-spot (across all product segments), was held by VW's "Fun Theory" campaign, the most viewed viral video as of October 2011.

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in television advertising in [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], and the [[United States]] reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Michelle R. | last2 = Paek | first2 = Hye-Jin | year = 2008 | title = Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries | url = | journal = International Journal of Advertising | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 715–744 | doi=10.2501/s0265048708080281}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:New zealand aids foundation Riding hard.jpg|thumb|"Riding Hard", part of the New Zealand AIDS Foundation's #loveyourcondom campaign]] --&gt;
Historically, sex in advertising has focused on heterosexual gender roles, but there are increasing examples of sex being used to advertise to the [[LGBT]] community. The New Zealand Aids Foundation's Love Your Condom (LYC) campaign used provocative images of males alongside captions such as "Riding hard?", "Bear hunting?" and "Going deep?", followed by the hashtag #loveyourcondom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loveyourcondom.co.nz/condoms|title=Order free condoms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped by using images explicitly directed towards homosexual men, their use of condoms would increase, which would help decrease rates of HIV transmission amongst gay and bisexual men. The campaign has been successful, with a 12% in new [[HIV]] infections among [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation |title=History of NZAF |url=https://www.nzaf.org.nz/about-us/history-of-nzaf/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Georgia in 2003, researchers looked at sexual advertisements in magazines over the span of the last 30 years. The rate at which sex in advertising is being used increased from 15% to 27% in the advertisements that the researchers looked at. Their reasoning behind the increase is because they believe sex still sells, specifically with “low-risk products impulse purchases.” The study also mentions “alcohol, entertainment and beauty are the main product categories that use sex in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2649-sex-sells-more.html|title=Why Sex Sells…More Than Ever|newspaper=Business News Daily|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Stereotypes===
The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to reinforce sexist stereotypes. Since the late 1970s, many researchers have determined that advertisements depict women as having less social power than men, but the ways in which females are displayed as less powerful than men have evolved over time. In modern times, advertisements have displayed women's expanding roles in the professional realm and importance in business backgrounds. However, as this change occurred there has been a substantial increase in the number of images that showcase women as less sexually powerful than men and as objects of men's desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankiewicz and Rosselli|first1=Julie and Francine|title=Women as Sex Objects and Victims in Print Advertisements|journal=Sex Roles|date=2008|issue=58.7|pages=579–589|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9359-1|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification ===

Furthermore, sex in advertising has been criticised for its emphasis on the importance of physical attractiveness and role as mate. This emphasis has led men and women to value intelligence and general skills less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Society|last=Pardun|first=Carol|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise in awareness of sexism portrayed in these types of adverts has led to stricter advertising policies. One group that enforces these rules is the [[Advertising Women of New York]] association. Adverts using highly sexual images containing nudity and unrealistic physiques can lead to self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|year=2004|title=Mere exposure:effects of priming a state of self-objectification|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|pages=17–28|via=|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000032306.20462.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this can lead to shame, disgust, appearance anxiety, eating disorders and depression. The increase in self-objectification caused by the use of sex in advertising has been found in women and men. The latter is not surprising with the increased sexual portrayal of men in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichart|first=Tom|year=1999|title=Cheesecake and beefcake: No matter how you slice it, sexual explicitness in advertising continues to increase.|url=|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=76|pages=7–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social norms ===

Sex in advertising is an accepted marketing technique however it is not unusual for it to cause backlash when it breaks social norms. In 1995, the Calvin Klein advertising campaign (see section on Calvin Klein, above) that showed teenage models in provocative poses wearing Calvin Klein underwear and jeans was deemed inappropriate and shocking. The ads were withdrawn when parents and child welfare groups threatened to protest and Hudson stores did not want their stores associated with the ads. It was reported that the [[US Justice Department]] was investigating the ad campaign for possible violations of federal child pornography and exploitation laws. The Justice Department subsequently decided not to prosecute Calvin Klein for these alleged violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-16/business/fi-3736_1_calvin-klein|title=Justice Department Plans No Charges Over Calvin Klein Ads|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1995-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skyy Vodka ===
[[Skyy Vodka]] is known for using sex in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epowers1.blogspot.com/2012/02/i-think-we-can-all-agree-with-statement.html|title=Liz's Media Criticism Blog: Skyy Ad Campaign Sells More Than Just Vodka|last=Powers|first=Liz|date=2012-02-16|website=Liz's Media Criticism Blog|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} In a specific Skyy Vodka advertisement, which was a part of Skyy Vodkas “SKYY SEXY” campaign in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100928006244/en/CORRECTING-REPLACING-Skyy-Spirits-Unveils-Sexiest-Ad|title=CORRECTING and REPLACING Skyy Spirits Unveils Sexiest Ad Campaign in SKYY® Vodka History    {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2016-12-12|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a woman's legs are wrapped around a bottle of Skyy Vodka. Bruce Lee Livingston, of the [[Marin Institute]] stated “This is just ridiculous, It’s a porn-a-hol”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-09-28-vodka28_ST_N.htm|title=Skyy pushes the envelope with sexy ad campaign - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to mention its affect on underage kids. “Underage kids will look at this and associate sexual prowess with drinking Skyy.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Skyy Vodka’s marketing director, Maura McGinn, defended the advertisement by stating, “It’s the content of our product...We’re an adult product consumed mostly in the evenings and in flirtatious situations.” McGinn even defended the advertisement when pitted against the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. ad code that states, “Beverage alcohol advertising and marketing materials should not rely upon sexual prowess or sexual success as a selling point for the brand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discus.org/responsibility/code/|title=Code of Responsible Practices {{!}} DISCUS|website=www.discus.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn stated “There is nothing in our ad that would suggest we are making such a claim.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Slovak National Museum''' ({{lang-sk|Slovenské národné múzeum}}) is the most important institution focusing on [[scientific research]] and cultural [[education]] in the field of [[museology]] in [[Slovakia]]. Its beginnings "are connected with the endeavour of the [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]] for national emancipation and self-determination".&lt;ref name = "SNM"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = City of Bratislava | url = http://www.snm.sk/?lang=eng&amp;org=0&amp;section=home&amp;show | title = Slovak national museum - Museum | date = n.d. |accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is headquartered in [[Bratislava]], however, the Slovak National Museum governs 18 specialized museums, most of which are located outside the city.

==History==
The Slovak National Museum (SNM) was established in 1961. Its origins lie in the [[Matica slovenská|Matica Slovenská]] Museum and the Museum of the National House in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]], which developed the Slovak Museology Society. The first permanent exposition funded from a national collection was opened in Martin in 1908. The museum was building [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], historical, [[numismatics|numismatic]], art historical, creative art and natural science collections. The Slovak National Geographic and History Museum was established in Bratislava in 1924 by the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum Society. The [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] Museum, a department of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Agricultural Museum in [[Prague]], was established in Bratislava the same year. In 1940, the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum and the Agricultural Museum were merged into the Slovak Museum. In 1961, the Slovak Museum and the [[Slovak National Museum in Martin]] were merged into the Slovak National Museum, based in Bratislava.&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

On March 11, 2012, the Krásna Hôrka Castle (part of the SNM), was damaged by a fire started when two children were lighting cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2113802/Kosice-Slovakia-Children-burn-14th-century-castle-cigarette.html |title=14th century castle gutted in blaze sparked by two young boys who had sneaked into grounds to smoke their first cigarette |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=12 March 2012 |author=Tom Gardner |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire destroyed the roof but most of the historic collections were undamaged. The castle is expected to reopen in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20056484/burned-krasna-horka-castle-should-open-in-2018.html |title=Burned Krásna Hôrka Castle should open in 2018 |newspaper=The Spectator, Slovakia |date=10 March 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The museum today==
[[Image:BA-riverfront-06.jpg|thumb|right|Slovak National Museum building in Bratislava, viewed from the right bank of the [[Danube]]]]
The Slovak National Museum is the most important scientific research and cultural education institution, with the largest and best collections in the museological field in Slovakia. The museum is also dedicated to scientific research tasks and [[publishing]] activities. Moreover, the SNM is "a coordination, methodological, professional advisory, statistical, educational and information centre for the whole field of museology in the Slovak Republic."&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

===Building===
The Slovak National Museum's headquarters are located on Vajanské nábrežie (a river front street in [[Old Town, Bratislava|Bratislava's Old Town]]), along with the Natural History Museum. The construction of the building, designed by architect M. M. Harminec, began in July 1925 and was completed in 1928. The museum opened on May 4, 1930.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">'''Spring line settlements''' occur where a ridge of [[wiktionary:permeable|permeable]] rock lies over impermeable rock and there will be a line of [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] along the boundary between the two layers.

It sometimes happens that a sequence of spring line (or springline) settlements will arise around these springs, becoming villages.

In each case to build higher up the hill would have meant difficulties with water supply; to build lower would have taken the settlement further away from useful grazing land or nearer to the [[floodplain]].

Spring line villages are often the principal settlements in [[strip parish]]es, with long, narrow [[parish]] boundaries stretching up to the top of the ridge and down to the river but being narrow in the direction of adjacent spring line villages.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples in England==
* to the north and south of the [[Howardian Hills]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the west and east of the ridge that stretches south from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and on top of which is the [[Roman road]] [[Ermine Street]]. The western line (which includes [[Boothby Graffoe]] and [[Navenby]]) is close under the escarpment; the eastern line (which includes [[Metheringham]]) is up to {{convert|6|mi|0}} away from the crest of the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 21B&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the south of [[London]] and difficult to identify among the continuous housing development of later centuries, there are: [[Ewell]] (a derivative of the [[Old English]] ''Et Welle''), [[Cheam]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Carshalton]], [[Wallington, London|Wallington]], [[Beddington]], [[Waddon]], [[Croydon]], [[Addiscombe]], [[Elmers End]], and [[Beckenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 33&lt;/ref&gt; Road and place names to the north of the line provide evidence that that area was relatively uninhabited: Cheam [[common land|Common]], [[Sutton Common]], [[Thornton Heath]], and [[South Norwood|Norwood]] (a derivative of ''North Wood'').
* Below the northern [[escarpment]] of the [[South Downs]] are villages such as [[Edburton]], [[Fulking]] and [[Poynings]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 34&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Vale of the White Horse]] (now in [[Oxfordshire]], formerly in [[Berkshire]]), villages such as [[East Ginge]], West Ginge, [[Letcombe Bassett]], [[Childrey]] and [[Woolstone, Oxfordshire|Woolstone]] are at the head of wooded valleys below [[the Ridgeway]] on the north-facing scarp slope.
* In [[East Anglia]], spring line settlements such as [[Burwell, Cambridgeshire]], [[Swaffham Prior]], [[Cherry Hinton]] mark the fen edge and are close to the probable Lower [[Icknield Way]].

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].

'''''Vagina dentata''''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[tooth]]ed [[vagina]]'') describes a [[folklore|folk tale]] in which a woman's vagina is said to contain teeth, with the associated implication that [[sexual intercourse]] might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. The topic of "vagina dentata" may also cover a rare medical condition affecting the vagina, in which case it is more accurately termed a ''vaginal [[dermoid cyst]]''.

==In folklore==
Such folk stories are frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage [[rape]].&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;

[[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] relays one such myth in which "a fish inhabits the vagina of the Terrible Mother; the hero is the man who overcomes the Terrible Mother, breaks the teeth out of her vagina, and so makes her into a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Erich| last=Neumann| year=1955| title=The Great Mother| page=168| location=Princeton | publisher=Princeton University Press|author2=translated by Ralph Manheim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend also appears in the mythology of the [[Chaco (tribe)|Chaco]] and [[The Guianas|Guiana]] tribes of South America. In some versions, the hero leaves one tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leach | first = Maria | title = Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend | publisher = Funk &amp; Wagnalls | location = New York | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-308-40090-9 | page = 1152 | chapter = vagina dentata | others = entry by Erminie W.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, the ''[[asura]]'' [[Andhaka]], son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] (but not aware of it), is killed by Shiva when he tries to force the disguised Shiva into surrendering Parvati. Andhaka's son Adi, also an ''asura'', takes the form of Parvati to seduce and kill Shiva with a toothed vagina in order to avenge Andhaka, but is also slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger |title=Śiva: The Erotic Ascetic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnfZ_MBErlQC&amp;pg=PA188 |accessdate=21 April 2013 |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London &amp; New York |isbn=0-19-520250-3 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ainu and Shinto legends===
The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] legend is that a sharp-toothed [[demon]] hid inside the [[vagina]] of a young woman and  [[emasculated]] two young men on their wedding nights.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/07/kanamara-matsuri-2014_n_5105892.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri 2014: What You Should Know About Japan's Penis Festival (NSFW PHOTOS)|publisher=huffingtonpost.ca|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the woman sought help from a blacksmith who fashioned an iron [[phallus]] to break the demon's teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, B.

The legendary iron phallus is considered that enshrined at the Kanayama [[Shinto]] Shrine in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Japan]], and there the popular [[Kanamara Matsuri|Festival of the Steel Phallus]] {{nihongo3|(かなまら祭り)}} is held each spring.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/_mobile/celebs/entertainment/festival-steel-phallus-japan|title=Dammit, we missed The Festival of the Steel Phallus in Japan this weekend - Cosmopolitan|publisher=cosmopolitan.co.uk|accessdate=2014-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125132/http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/_mobile/celebs/entertainment/festival-steel-phallus-japan|archive-date=2014-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/07/japan-penis-festival-kanamara-matsuri_n_5106378.html|title=Japan's Annual Penis Festival Is As Phallic As You'd Expect (PHOTOS)|author=Dominique Mosbergen|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-04-11|date=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeslive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/2014/04/10/japanese-festival-celebrates-the-penis|title=Japanese festival celebrates the penis - Times LIVE|author=Times LIVE|publisher=timeslive.co.za|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/slideshow/20140325-ten-exciting-events-not-to-miss-in-april|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331232907/http://www.bbc.com/travel/slideshow/20140325-ten-exciting-events-not-to-miss-in-april |archive-date=2014-03-31 |dead-url=yes|title=BBC - Travel - Slideshow - Ten events not to miss in April|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[prostitutes]] considered that praying at that shrine protected them against [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/04/kanamara-matsuri-penis-festival_n_5087119.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri: When Does Japan's Penis Festival Start?

===Māori mythology===
In [[Māori mythology]], the [[trickster]] [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]] tries to grant mankind [[immortality]] by reversing the [[birth]] process, turning into a [[worm]] and crawling into the goddess of [[night]] and [[death]] [[Hine-nui-te-pō]]'s vagina and out through her mouth while she sleeps. His trick is ruined when a [[pīwakawaka]] laughs at the sight of his entry, awakening Hine-nui-te-pō, who bites him to death with her [[obsidian]] vaginal teeth.

==Metaphorical usage==
In her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1991), [[Camille Paglia]] wrote:
:The toothed vagina is no sexist hallucination: every penis is made less in every vagina, just as mankind, male and female, is devoured by mother nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Paglia|Paglia, Camille]] (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]]''. NY: Vintage. p. 47. {{ISBN|9780679735793}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Wimp Factor'', Stephen J. Ducat expresses a similar view, that these myths express the threat sexual intercourse poses for men who, although entering triumphantly, always leave diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In rare instances, [[dermoid cyst]]s (a type of tumor) may grow in the vagina. Dermoid cysts are formed from the outer layers of embryonic skin cells. These cells are able to mature into many different types of tissues, and these cysts are able to form anywhere the skin is or where the skin folds inwards to become another organ, such as in the ear or the vagina. However, when dermoid cysts occur in the vagina, they are covered by a layer of normal vaginal tissue and therefore appear as a lump, not as recognizable teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is vaginal dermoid cyst a rare occurrence or a misnomer?
