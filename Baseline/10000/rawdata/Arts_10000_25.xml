}}

"'''A Streetcar Named Marge'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 1, 1992. In the episode, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] wins the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in a [[community theatre]] [[musical theatre|musical]] version of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] offers little support for his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and [[Stanley Kowalski]], the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a [[subplot]] in which [[Maggie Simpson]] attempts to retrieve her [[pacifier]] from a strict [[day care|daycare]] owner.

[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] wrote the episode, and [[Rich Moore]] served as director. [[Jon Lovitz]] made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'', this time as musical director [[Llewellyn Sinclair]], as well as Llewellyn's sister, who runs the daycare. The episode generated controversy for its original song about [[New Orleans]], which contains several unflattering lyrics about the city. One New Orleans newspaper published the lyrics before the episode aired, prompting numerous complaints to the local Fox affiliate; in response, the president of Fox Broadcasting issued an apology to anyone who was offended. Despite the controversial song, the episode was well received by many fans, and show creator [[Matt Groening]] has named it one of his favorite episodes.

==Plot==
While [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are watching television, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] announces that she is going to audition for a local musical production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', and she wants to meet new people because she usually spends all day caring for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The rest of the family pay no attention and continue to watch television.

The musical, ''Oh, Streetcar!'', is directed by Llewellyn Sinclair. After [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] is cast as Stanley Kowalski, Marge auditions for Blanche DuBois. Llewellyn immediately rejects Marge, explaining that Blanche is supposed to be a "delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout". However, as a dejected Marge calls home and takes Homer's dinner order, Llewellyn realizes that she is perfect for the role.

The next day, Maggie causes distractions when Marge brings her to rehearsal, so Llewellyn tells Marge to enroll the baby at the daycare center, The [[Ayn Rand]] School for Tots, which is run by his sister Ms. Sinclair, who immediately confiscates Maggie's pacifier. Maggie and the other babies later engage in an attempt to retrieve their pacifiers, but Ms. Sinclair thwarts their efforts and sends Maggie to a [[playpen]].

During rehearsal, Marge struggles with a scene in which Blanche is supposed to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.

The next day at the daycare center, Maggie again attempts to regain her pacifier. With assistance from her fellow babies, following a complicated plan, she succeeds and wildly distributes pacifiers to all the small children. Homer retrieves her, and he and his children go to attend the musical. Homer immediately falls into boredom, but he perks up when Marge appears on stage. While Homer slowly learns the show's plot, he appears sad.  At the end of the musical, Marge receives a warm reaction from the crowd, but she misinterprets Homer's sadness for boredom. She confronts him with frustration and hostility, but Homer is able to explain that he was genuinely moved by the play. He feels for Blanche's situation, and he realizes Marge's feelings along with it. He expresses his intentions to be the husband that she deserves—someone to have in her life who loves her—not like Stanley who neglects and mistreats his wife. Marge realizes that Homer really did watch the musical, and the two happily leave the theater.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997|p=93}}&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Production==
===Writing and music===
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[James L. Brooks]] pitched the idea of Marge playing Blanche DuBois.]]
"A Streetcar Named Marge" was conceived about two years before it aired on television.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Jeff. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Martin first pitched the idea of Homer being in a theatrical production of ''[[1776 (play)|1776]]''; producer [[James L. Brooks]] then suggested that Marge could play Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. Brooks saw that Marge's relationship with Homer was similar to Blanche's relationship with Stanley, and he wanted to use that fact to build the emotional arc for an episode. The estate of [[Tennessee Williams]] would not let the show use large excerpts from the actual play, since the work was copyrighted.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; However, Fox lawyer Anatole Klebanow said that original songs based on the play were acceptable. According to producer [[Mike Reiss]], Klebanow even promised to "take [their] case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to get [the] episode aired."&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;Reiss, Mike. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin later explained that while the songs made the episode funnier, they also made it harder to write.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

The Maggie subplot was present in Martin's episode pitch.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The music in the sequence is [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s [[march (music)|march]] theme from ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''. ''Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] secured the rights to the score, along with the original orchestra charts. ''The Great Escape'' had been Martin's favorite film as a child, and he said "it was so exciting and so stirring" to hear the music being performed by the ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; studio orchestra.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

===Animation===
"A Streetcar Named Marge" posed a challenge to the show's [[animation director]]s. The episode contains many long [[set piece]]s, especially during the third and final act, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters.&lt;ref name="Groening"/&gt; [[Rich Moore]], the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], the supervising director, also had doubts;&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; according to Martin, Moore sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes popping out and his jaw dropped.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Producer [[Al Jean]] said that Moore "worked himself to death" to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

A number of scenes that appeared in the [[storyboard]] and [[animatic]] were reordered or dropped altogether in the final version of the episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, Rich. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice acting===
All the main ''Simpsons'' [[List of The Simpsons cast members#Regular cast|cast members]] lent their voices to the episode, along with semi-regulars [[Maggie Roswell]] and [[Phil Hartman]]. Assistant producer [[Lona Williams]] also had a minor speaking role.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; 

Comedian [[Jon Lovitz]], who played Llewellyn Sinclair and Ms. Sinclair, made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons''; he had previously voiced characters in "[[The Way We Was]]", "[[Brush with Greatness]]", and "[[Homer Defined]]". Lovitz later worked with Al Jean and Mike Reiss in the animated sitcom ''[[The Critic]]'', and returned to ''The Simpsons'' for the episodes "[[A Star Is Burns]]", "[[Hurricane Neddy]]", "[[Half-Decent Proposal]]", "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]" and "[[Homerazzi]]". In 2006, Lovitz was named the eighth-best ''Simpsons'' guest star by [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html |title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances |accessdate=2007-03-25 |last1=Goldman |first1= Eric |last2=Iverson |first2= Dan  |last3=Zoromski |first3= Brian |date= January 4, 2010|publisher= IGN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070306095518/http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html |archivedate=6 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
[[File:Simpsons Hitchcock.png|left|200px|thumb|Alfred Hitchcock walking his dogs, a reference to his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo]] in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'']]
Though ''Oh, Streetcar!'' is based on ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', the title of the musical alludes to the theatrical [[revue]] ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''. Besides Blanche and Stanley, characters from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' who appear in ''Oh, Streetcar!'' include Stella (played by [[Helen Lovejoy]]), the Young Collector (played by [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]]), Mitch (played by [[Lionel Hutz]]), the Doctor (played by [[Chief Wiggum]]), Steve (played by [[Jasper Beardley]], although Apu originally said he was playing Steve), and Pablo (originally played by [[Otto Mann]] but taken over by Llewellyn prior to curtain). The musical's closing song, "Kindness of Strangers", is a reference to Blanche's last line in the original play: "I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." However, the song is very cheery in tone, intentionally missing the point of Blanche's line, which is meant by the playwright Tennessee Williams to be ironic.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

The episode contains multiple references to [[Ayn Rand]]'s novels and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]]. Maggie's daycare center is called the "Ayn Rand School for Tots", and Ms. Sinclair can be seen reading a book called ''The Fountainhead Diet'', a reference to Rand's novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. On the wall of the daycare is a poster that reads "Helping is Futile", an allusion to Rand's rejection of the ethical doctrine of [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. Another wall sign reads "A is A", the [[law of identity]], which plays a central role in Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=64–65}} The Ayn Rand School for Tots is seen again in the 2012 [[short film]] "[[The Longest Daycare]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='The Simpsons': Exclusive details on the next big-screen adventure (it's short, silent, and in 3-D)! |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/22/the-simpsons-short-film/ |accessdate= 2012-07-05 |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maggie subplot uses the musical score of ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and contains several other allusions to the film. At one point, Ms. Sinclair punishes Maggie by sending her to a playpen called "the box", a play on the solitary confinement facility called "the cooler" from the 1963 film. Maggie even bounces a ball against the wall of the playpen, as [[Steve McQueen]]'s character Virgil Hilts does throughout the film while he is in confinement.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In the scene when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched all over the building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a reference to his own [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearance]] in the film.&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt; The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches his wife in the musical.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Merchandise==
All the songs from "A Streetcar Named Marge" were released on [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]' 2000 album ''[[Songs in the Key of Springfield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Songs in the Key of Springfield |date=1997-03-27 |page=F4 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |author =Kloer, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was included in the 2005 [[VHS]] set ''The Simpsons Go Hollywood''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Home Video |date=2000-01-14 |page=51 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another Homer for the Simpsons |date=2000-01-14 |page=11J |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |author =Maurstad, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on [[DVD]] in 2004 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 4)#DVD release|''The Simpsons Complete Fourth Season'']].

==Reception==
[[File:Matt_Groening_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] includes the episode among his favorites.]]
In its original broadcast, "A Streetcar Named Marge" finished 32nd in ratings for the week of September 27&amp;nbsp;– October 4, 1992, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[Married... with Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New romantic comedies give CBS boost |work=Sun-Sentinel |author =Hastings, Deborah |page=6E |date=October 9, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of ''[[The Times]]'' ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6988097.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 |title=The 10 best Simpsons episodes ever |last=Moran |first=Michael |date=January 14, 2010 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2010-01-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Dalton Ross lauded it as "the show's best ever musical episode",&lt;ref name="EW3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,649847,00.html |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season |accessdate=2007-09-06 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |author=Ross, Dalton |date=2004-06-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016163549/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C649847%2C00.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every [[Tony Award|Tony]] viewer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Kehr |title='The Simpsons':The Complete Fourth Season. |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E7 |date=2004-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of [[Canadian Online Explorer]] added, "As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]''."&lt;ref name="Canoe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/S/Simpsons/2003/02/16/735323.html |title='The Simpsons' hits a Homer run |accessdate=2007-09-06 |date=2004-06-18 |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |author=Williamson, Kevin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130101082231/http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/S/Simpsons/2003/02/16/735323.html |archivedate=2013-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator [[Matt Groening]] has listed it as one of his own favorites, calling the subplot "Maggie's finest moment",&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275114,00.html |title=Springfield of Dreams |accessdate=2007-08-26 |date=2000-01-14 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |author =Snierson, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and future ''Simpsons'' guest star [[Trey Anastasio]] said the episode "may have been the best TV show ever".&lt;ref name="EW2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,237327,00.html |title=S.A.T.'S For Rockers |accessdate=2007-09-06 |date=2000-05-17 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Wook |last=Kim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016163540/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C237327%2C00.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[James L.

In 1993, "A Streetcar Named Marge" and "[[Mr. Plow]]" were submitted for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]". Before this season, the series had only been allowed to compete in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]]" category, winning twice, but in early 1993 the rules were changed so that animated television shows would be able to submit nominations for "Outstanding Comedy Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=`Simpsons' get Emmy 's respect&amp;nbsp;— Academy lets series drop cartoon status to compete as sitcom |date=1993-02-02 |page=B4 |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |author =Holloway, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and ''The Simpsons'' did not receive a nomination. The ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but again these were not nominated.&lt;ref name="Mr. Plow"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |year=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Mr. Plow]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won seven times.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;[http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Emmy Awards official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014192522/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |date=October 14, 2008 }} "The Simpsons" ''emmys.org''.

===Controversy===
[[File:Jeff Martin.jpg|alt=Martin smiling|thumb|Writer Jeff Martin (pictured here in 1994) received criticism for satirizing New Orleans]]
The musical within the episode contains a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes the city as a "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of a song in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', which speaks of London in unflattering terms ("There's No Place Like London").&lt;ref name="Martin2"&gt;Martin, Jeff (2004). "The Cajun Controversy", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jean later explained that two [[Cajun]] characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent.&lt;ref name=Lorando&gt;{{cite news |title='Simpsons' takes a shot at Crescent City |date=1992-10-01 |page=A1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the scene can be seen in an animatic included in the DVD boxset.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;Moore, Rich. (2004). Animatic for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the premiere of the fourth season, the producers sent two episodes to critics: "[[Kamp Krusty]]" and "A Streetcar Named Marge".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; A New Orleans critic viewed "A Streetcar Named Marge" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired.&lt;ref name=Lorando/&gt; Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' then-Fox affiliate, [[WNOL-TV]] (then-owned by musician [[Quincy Jones]]; the Fox affiliation for the area later moved to [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]]), received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fox apologizes for 'Simpsons' |date=1992-10-02 |page=B1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of WNOL, Fox president [[Jamie Kellner]] released a statement on October 1, 1992:

{{cquote|It has come to our attention that a comedic song about New Orleans in tonight's episode of "The Simpsons" has offended some city residents and officials. Viewers who watch the episode will realize that the song is in fact a parody of the opening numbers of countless Broadway musicals, which are designed to set the stage for the story that follows. That is the only purpose of this song. We regret that the song, taken out of context, has caused offense. This was certainly not the intention of "The Simpsons" production staff or Fox Broadcasting Company.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;"The Cajun Controversy" (2004), in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; producers rushed out a [[chalkboard gag]] for "[[Homer the Heretic]]", which aired a week after "A Streetcar Named Marge". It read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag was their attempt to apologize for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end.&lt;ref name="Martin2"/&gt; "We didn't realize people would get so mad", said Al Jean. "It was the best apology we could come up with in eight words or less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song |date=1992-10-08 |page=A1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue passed quickly, and a person in a Bart Simpson costume even served as [[Krewe of Tucks]] Grand Marshal at the 1993 [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For Silver Celebration, Tucks 'Lov-A-Da Music |date=1993-02-21 |page=D7 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode generated further controversy in September 2005, when [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with [[Ofcom]]. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a key part of the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur.&lt;ref name="Ofcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/#skip |title=Issue number 46 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |year=2005 |publisher=Ofcom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813150912/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/ |archivedate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{plot|date=May 2014}}

===Prologue===
In [[Long Island]] a teenage [[Minae Mizumura]] meets Taro Azuma, another [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrant who works as the chauffeur of one of her father's associates who, unlike [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] and the other immigrants she knows, is poor. [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]]'s father finds him studious and hardworking and hires him as a technician for the [[camera]] company he works for.

Over the years [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] and Azuma encounter each other briefly at company outings and parties. Right before she leaves high school [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] has a moment where she reflects that her life is full of possibility and Azuma's is not. However Azuma does eventually become extremely successful. After becoming a technician who specializes in [[endoscopes]] Azuma begins to sell them and receives increasingly large commissions. When the company tries to cut his commission percentage Azuma leaves and creates his own company.

[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]]'s family meanwhile enters a period of decline after her father is demoted and her mother leaves him for another man. She and her sister squander their education and youth. Later [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] manages to begin a career for herself as an academic and begins writing novels. She returns to America occasionally where she catches up with old friends and learns of Azuma's rise to success. One year she returns and discovers that he has disappeared and no one has heard anything of him.

In 1998 while teaching at [[Stanford University]], 
[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] is approached by a young man, Yusuke Kato, who tells her that he met Azuma a few years before he disappeared in [[Karuizawa, Nagano]] where he mentioned he knew the novelist [[Minae Mizumura]]. Yusuke and [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]] spend the night discussing Azuma and [[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura]], who had been struggling with her third novel, decides that Azuma's story would make a perfect novel. She explains to the reader that while she had originally intended to write an [[I Novel]] her work is a [[True Novel]], i.e. a novel that is pure fiction.

===Volume I===
Yusuke Kato is persuaded by a wealthy friend to spend time with him in his vacation cottage in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]]. While traveling through [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] at night he has a bicycle accident in front of an old run-down house. The house is owned by an unfriendly middle-aged man, Taro Azuma, but Kato is persuaded to stay the night by the maid of the house, Fumiko Tsuchiya. The following day he encounters Fumiko again and is taken to the house of three snobbish elderly sisters, Harue, Natsue and Fuyue. The sisters are there to scatter the ashes of Yoko, Natsue's daughter. They hint at their relationship to Taro who they dismiss as the relation of one of the sister's rickshaw drivers. Afterwards, Fumiko invites him back to Taro's house in order to tell him about Taro and his relationship to the sisters.

Fumiko begins the story by telling how she was born in 1937 to poor farmers in [[Saku, Nagano]]. Her early memories are of the extreme poverty suffered during [[World War II]]. As a teenager, she moved to [[Tokyo]] with her uncle Genji "George" who secured her a position as a maid on an American army base. When Fumiko was 17 he contacted wealthy acquaintances in order to try to find her work as a maid in a private household. She was eventually sent to work as a maid and nanny for Natsue and her two young daughters Yuko and Yoko.

Natsue is the middle daughter of the Saegusa family, a snobbish clan descended from wealthy landowners. The family is close to the Shigemitsu family who, despite being financially poorer, are descended from nobility. The two families share adjoining plots of land in [[Tokyo]] as well as in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] where they both vacation. The families celebrate Western ideals over [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] ones with each family having spent significant time in Europe. Each Saegusa sister had once held aspirations of marrying into the Shigemitsu family but the only son, Noriyuki, died during the war.

Fumiko spends her time taking care of Yoko, Natsue's youngest child, who doesn't fit in with the rest of her Saegusa and Shugemitsu members of her generation and who is kept close to home. Shortly after Yoko begins to attend school Roku, an old servant of Yoko's grandfather, invites his nephew and his family to stay with him. The youngest of the nephew's children is Taro. Taro is routinely abused by his family and Fumiko later learns that he is actually the illegitimate child of one of Roku's nieces and was raised by his uncle after his mother died. When local children begin to bully him Yoko joins in, only to be discouraged from doing so by her father. She eventually shows him small kindnesses and he becomes enraptured by her. At the same time Fumiko and Yoko's step-grandmother Mrs. Utagawa conspire to have him work in the Utagawa household so as to spare him the abuse from his aunt.

===Volume II===
Yoko and Taro grow increasingly close throughout the years, encouraged by Mrs. Utagawa, who hides their relationship from Yoko's parents. The only time they spend apart is her vacation months in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]]. Mrs. Utagawa eventually persuades her step-son to build her a villa in [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]]. She takes Taro with her to help around the house, however he is hurt when he visits Yoko in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] and the Saegusas and Shigemitsus treat him as a handyman.

Eventually Mrs. Utagawa dies. Her final wish being that her step-son provide enough money for Taro to go to high school. The family complies with her wishes, however shortly after Yoko's father transfers to a university in [[Sapporo]]. Yoko and Taro stay in sporadic contact throughout the years, aided by Fumiko. When Yoko is eighteen she contacts Taro again and she and Fumiko are surprised to discover that his adoptive family used the money meant for his education as a down payment for a small business. When they finally meet, chaperoned by Fumiko, Yoko is humiliated by Taro’s sullen behaviour but arranges a more clandestine meeting with him. After a few days she is discovered naked in the summer home in [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]], sick with [[pneumonia]]. Yoko's family is humiliated, believing that Taro and Yoko had sex; Yoko later reveals to Fumiko that Taro refused to have sex with her after she told him she would never marry him.

Taro runs away from his adoptive parents to live with Fumiko. He drinks heavily and gives up his plans for education instead focusing his sights on moving to America. Fumiko's uncle Genji helps to secure him a position as a chauffeur in [[New York City]] and Taro leaves, disappearing for fifteen years.

After seven years Yoko marries Masayuki, the only son in the Shigetmitsu family, finally fulfilling the desire of the Shigemitsus and Saegusas to unite through marriage.

Taro eventually comes back into Fumiko and Yoko’s lives when he anonymously buys the old [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa and enlists Fumiko to renovate it. Spending a week there on vacation he is hesitant to contact Yoko, but Fumiko intervenes and the two are briefly reunited. Their first meeting is interrupted by a weeping Masayuki. Yoko pledges to stay married to him.

After her second husband dies Fumiko is persuaded by Taro to work for him in [[Tokyo]] and, in her late forties, eventually becomes the career woman she longed to be. Yoko and Taro become lovers with Masayuki’s blessing. Their unconventional relationship works for seven years until the Saegusa sisters stumble upon Taro and Yoko in public. Hatsue confronts Masayuki who in turn fights with Yoko to the point where he says he no longer wishes to be married to her.

Unable to bear the thought of her husband leaving her, Yoko runs away. She is eventually found days later in one of the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] homes that Fumiko failed to search properly. She develops pneumonia and dies although not before forcing Taro to promise her that he will not kill himself before Masayuki dies. A few years later Masayuki develops cancer and dies and he and Yoko's remains are meant to be scattered around the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] which is why Fumiko is there in the present.

As Fumiko's story ends Fuyue arrives at the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa and informs Fumiko that now that both Yoko and Masayuki are dead Taro is leaving her with both the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] and [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] homes.

Fuyue then drives Yusuke home, but not before revealing that during the period where Taro lived with Fumiko in Tokyo the two became lovers.

Before his vacation ends Yusuke returns to the [[Oiwake-shuku|Oiwake]] villa in secret where he watches Fumiko and Taro scatter Yoko and Masayuki's ashes.

[[File:Jan van Kessel - Air.jpg|thumb|''Air'', oil on copper, c. 1647, 76.2 × 99.1 cm]]

'''''Air''''' is a painting created by [[Flemish]] painter [[Jan van Kessel, senior|Jan van Kessel]] (1626–1679) and was painted around the year 1647. It is a part of the permanent collection at the [[Flint Institute of Arts]].

The [[Classical elements|four elements]] – earth, air, fire and water – were popular subjects with 17th century painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Val A. Browning Collection: A Selection of Old Master Paintings | author=Ed. Sheila D. Muller | publisher=The Utah Museum of Fine Arts, University of Utah |year=1958| location=Salt Lake City  |oclc=48406944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, air is represented by a wide variety of creatures of flight, mythological figures and atmospheric conditions. A multitude of birds, including peacocks, turkeys, parrots, owls and an ostrich are shown in the painting. Several bats also appear in the painting, including one in the upper right that devours a bird while in flight. In the center of the painting, Apollo drives his chariot across the sky. Beneath him, [[Urania]], the Muse of Astronomy, sits on a cloud, and in her left hand she holds an [[armillary sphere]]. Another of her attributes, the compass, appears on the ground next to her along with an [[astrolabe]], a [[Quadrant (astronomy)|quadrant]], and a [[Jacob's staff|cross staff]], which are all instruments used for measuring the position of the planets and stars. All of this takes place in a landscape characterized by a dark, stormy sky on the left, complete with a bolt of lightning. On the right, the sky brightens over a vast expanse of trees and mountains.

The composition can be traced back to a prototype developed by van Kessel's grandfather, [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel I]]. Like his uncle, [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|Jan Brueghel II]], and other members of his family, van Kessel continued Jan I's work. In fact, the tradition of copying the elder Brueghel's composition continued into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abcgallery.com/B/bruegel/janbio.html Jan Brueghel the Elder]".

[[File:Thessaloniki Arch and tomb of Galerius.jpg|thumb|360px|The Arch of Galerius and the Rotunda (with a post added minaret), 299-303 AD]]

The '''Arch of Galerius''' ([[Greek language|Gr.]]: Αψίδα&amp;#32;του&amp;#32;Γαλερίου) or '''Kamara''' ([[Greek language|Gr.]]: Καμάρα) and the '''Rotunda''' (Ροτόντα) are neighbouring early 4th-century AD monuments in the city of [[Thessaloniki]], in the region of [[Central Macedonia]] in northern [[Greece]].

==History==
[[Image:Saint George Rotunda reconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|Rotunda and Arch of Galerius complex reconstruction]]
[[File:Brána římského vojevůdce Galeria v Soluni.jpg|thumb|The arch in 1913]]
[[File:Galeriusarch.jpg|thumb|Close view]]

The 4th-century [[Roman Emperor]] [[Galerius]] commissioned these two structures as elements of an imperial precinct linked to his Thessaloniki palace. [[Archeologists]] have found substantial remains of the palace to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;The palace of Galerius was built on a massive scale using primarily local materials. It may have been built over the destruction layer of a fire that cleared an area. Expansive areas of mosaic are preserved in several areas. A structure linked to the palace and called the Octagonal Room is at the southwest end of the excavated area at 40°37'48.53"N, 22°56'55.99"E; thought at one point to be a [[mausoleum]], it may have been a monumental entryway to the palace. Beside the palace to the northeast was a [[hippodrome]].&lt;/ref&gt; These three monumental structures were connected by a road that ran through the arch, which rose above the major east-west road of the city.

At the crux of the major axes of the city, the Arch of Galerius emphasized the power of the emperor and linked the monumental structures with the fabric of 4th-century Thessaloniki. The arch was composed of a masonry core faced with [[marble]] sculptural panels celebrating a victory over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. About two-thirds the arch is preserved.

The Rotunda was a massive circular structure with a masonry core that had an [[oculus]] like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. It has gone through multiple periods of use and modification as a polytheist temple, a Christian basilica, a Muslim mosque, and again a Christian church (and archaeological site). A minaret is preserved from its use as a mosque, and ancient remains are exposed on its southern side.

==Location and description of the Arch==
[[File:ΑΨΙΔΑ ΓΑΛΕΡΙΟΥ 2.jpg|thumb|260px|left|The Arch of Galerius]]

The Arch of Galerius stands on what is now the intersection of ''Egnatia'' &amp; ''Dimitriou Gounari'' streets. The arch was built in 298 to 299 AD and dedicated in 303 AD to celebrate the victory of the [[tetrarchy|tetrarch]] [[Galerius]] over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]] at the [[Battle of Satala (298)|Battle of Satala]] and capture{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} of their capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 298.&lt;ref&gt;At this point Galerius was a ''Caesar'' (subordinate emperor); he became one of the two ''Augusti'' (head emperors) in 305 AD, when [[Diocletian]] abdicated.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was an octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) forming a triple arch that was built of a rubble masonry core faced first with brick and then with marble panels with sculptural relief. The central arched opening was 9.7 m wide and 12.5 m high, and the secondary openings on other side were 4.8 m wide and 6.5 m high. The central arch spanned the portion of the '' [[Via Egnatia]]'' (primary Roman road from Dyrrhacium to [[Byzantium]]) that passed through the city as a [[Decumanus Maximus|''Decumanus'']] (east-west major street). A road connecting the Rotunda (125m northeast) with the Palace complex (235m southwest) passed through the arch along its long axis.

Only the northwestern three of the eight pillars and parts of the [[masonry]] cores of the arches above survive: i.e., the entire eastern side (4 pillars) and the southernmost one of the western pillars are lost.&lt;ref&gt;The other parts of the structure were destroyed at an unknown date, probably during one of many [[earthquake]]s, which have damaged Thessaloniki throughout its history.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive consolidation with modern brick has been performed on the exposed masonry cores to protect the monument. The two pillars flanking the central arched passageway retain their sculpted [[marble]] slabs, which depict the wars of Galerius against the Persians in broadly panegyric terms.

===Sculptural program of the Arch===
[[Image:Arch-of-Galerius-1.jpg|thumb|left|Galerius (L) attacks Narses (R)]]
[[Image:Arch of Galerius (sacrifice).jpg|thumb|The imperial family at the sacrifice of thanksgiving.]]
[[Image:Arch-of-Galerius-2.jpg|thumb|The tetrarchs arrayed in unison with a ''Victoria'' holding a victory wreath to the ''Augusti''.]]

Understanding of the sculptural program of the arch is limited by the loss of the majority of the marble panels, but the remains give an impression of the whole. Four vertically stacked registers of sculpted decoration were carved on each pillar, each separated by elaborate moldings. A label for the [[Tigris River]] indicates that there were likely labels on other representations as the builders deemed necessary. Artistic license was taken in the representations, for instance, the Caesar Galerius is shown in personal combat with the Sassanid Shah Narses in one of the panels; although they never met in battle.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} On the arch a mounted Galerius attacks a similarly mounted Narses with a lance as an eagle bearing a victory wreath in its talons approaches Galerius. The Caesar sits securely on his rearing horse, while the Persian king appears nearly unhorsed. Terrified Persians cower under the hooves of the Caesar's horse in the chaos of battle. The panel expresses the power of the Caesar Galerius.

The relief of the imperial family conjoined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving owes its distant prototype to the Augustan reliefs on the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'' in Rome.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Galerius' wife, Diocletian's daughter Valeria, is shown at his side, helping authenticate his connection to his predecessor. Here as elsewhere all the faces have been carefully chiselled off, whether as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' or in later cultural intolerance of images.

In another panel, the tetrarchs are all arrayed in the toga as a ''Victoria'' holds a victory wreath out to the heads of the two ''Augusti''. A third panel celebrates the unity of the [[tetrarchy]], with a depiction of the tetrarchs standing together; the depersonalized manner in which the tetrarchs are portrayed is reminiscent of the schematic statues of the tetrarchs in porphyry at [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Only Galerius is dressed in armor, and he makes the offering upon the altar.

What remains of the arch asserts the glory of the tetrarchy and the prominence of Galerius within that system. The arch celebrates the Roman Empire as part of Galerius’ victory over the Sassanid king.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Galerius is also pictured on his horse at the right, while attacking a Sassanid guard.

==Rotunda of Galerius==

===Location and description of the Rotunda===
[[File:THES-Rotonde St-Georges plan.png|thumb|left|Plan]]

The Rotunda of Galerius is 125m northeast of the Arch of Galerius at 40°37'59.77"N, 22°57'9.77"E. It is also known (by its consecration and use) as the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]] Church of ''[[Saint George|Agios Georgios]]'', and is informally called the Church of the Rotunda (or simply ''The Rotunda'').

The cylindrical structure was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch [[Galerius]], who was thought to have intended it to be his [[mausoleum]]. It was more likely intended as a temple; it is not known to what god it would have been dedicated, probably [[Zeus]].

The Rotunda has a diameter of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is why it has withstood Thessaloniki's earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the west bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, the dome of the Rotunda had an ''[[oculus]]'', as does the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.

===Uses of the Rotunda===
[[Image:Rotunda of Galerius (February 2009).jpg|thumb|240px|left|The altar view of the Rotunda of Galerius, initially a Mausoleum of Roman Emperor Galerius, later a Christian church, and then a mosque. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and some days of the year functions as a church]]
[[File:Thessalonikki, Greece 5 Rotunda 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance, close view]]
[[File:Abside 00311.JPG|thumb|200px|The inside view of the altar, with the remaining wall paintings]]

After Galerius's death in 311, he was buried at [[Gamzigrad]] ([[Felix Romuliana]]) near [[Zajecar]], [[Serbia]]. The Rotunda stood empty for several years until the Emperor [[Constantine I]] ordered its conversion into a Christian church in 326. The church was embellished with very high quality [[mosaics]]. Only fragments have survived of the original decoration, for example, a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

The building was used as a church (''Church of Asomaton or Archangelon'') for over 1,200 years until the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. In 1590 it was converted into a [[mosque]], called the Mosque of Suleyman Hortaji Effendi, and a [[minaret]] was added to the structure. It was used as a mosque until 1912, when the Greeks captured the city during the [[Balkan War]]. Greek Orthodox officials reconsecrated the structure as a church, and they left the minaret. The structure was damaged during an earthquake in 1978 but was subsequently restored. {{As of|2004}}, the minaret was still being stabilized with scaffolding. The building is now a historical monument under the [[Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities]] of the [[Greek Ministry of Culture]], although the Greek Orthodox Church has access to the monument for various festivities some days of the year (as St. George Church).

The Rotunda is the oldest of Thessaloniki's churches. Some Greek publications claim it is the oldest Christian church in the world, although there are competitors for that title. It is the most important surviving example of a church from the early Christian period of the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire.

'''BookMooch''' is an international, on-line book exchange community founded by [[John Buckman]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, T. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/23/DDHE18BKE7.DTL&amp;type=books Book lovers trade tomes through Web sites]. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership, which has grown to around 74,000 in over 90 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/06/30/new-york-daily-news-story/ |title=New York Daily News Story « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005105544/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/06/30/new-york-daily-news-story/ |archivedate=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is open to anyone and is free. There is heavy community participation in its running and organisation.  About 500,000 book titles are available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/about/stats_show?chart=number_of_asins_listed&amp;type=chart |title=BookMooch charts - Books listed for giving: total number |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 2,000 books are swapped per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/03/25/is-bm-growing/ |title=Is BM growing? « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208150529/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/03/25/is-bm-growing/ |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

BookMooch allows its users to exchange books using a points system.  Members earn points by adding books to their inventories, by sending books to other members and by providing feedback when they receive books.  The points earned can then be used to “buy” books from other members.  All books “cost” the same number of points, with a multiple point surcharge for international mooches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/about/points |title=BookMooch Points |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point exchange takes place at the beginning of any transaction, allowing “currency” to circulate quickly. Members may opt to send books only within their own country, worldwide, or worldwide upon request.

There is no waiting period for a new member to begin to participate in BookMooch.  Setting up an initial trading inventory will earn enough points to begin trading immediately.  Forum members encourage new members by keeping an eye out for new inventories and posting links to them.

Member pages contain biographical information, conditions of trade and links to their transaction histories.  [[Web widget|Widgets]] allow members to personalise their pages and listings.  Links to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] sites in various countries allow members to enter books into the system quickly.  A notification system e-mails members when a book on their Wishlist becomes available and directs them to the Mooch screen for that book.

Members may choose to donate points to charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/charity |title=Charity |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Books for Prisons, public libraries, education and counselling services, children's and military book charities.  Members may add to the charity list if they have a particular charity they want to support.  The charities can then use their points to acquire books.

==Organization==

John Buckman continues to maintain and add features to the site and run it with the assistance of a small, international admin team who participate in the forums and resolve any issues.  The Official BookMooch Blog&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504011926/http://blog.bookmooch.com/ |archivedate=2007-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; records his travels, new BM projects, ideas and solicits input and feedback. Members of the forum contribute help and advice, feature suggestions, book talk, chat and “special offers.”

==Member contributions==

Members are active in suggesting and contributing features to the system. Member-run, associated BookMooch activities include:

*The BookMooch Angel Network – In response to increases in postal rates which  discourage some users from mailing abroad, a group of volunteer “angels” exist who will mooch books within their own country and send them on to members in other countries;
*The BookMooch Support Group is for members who commit to reading at least two of their stacked-up To Be Read piles during the month and post reviews to the Support Group's blog, The Smoke Lives.
*The BookMooch Journal Project – Journals/Notebooks posted by a member for Mooching.  Each member who mooches contributes artwork or as directed by the originator and adds the book to their own inventory to be Mooched.
*BookMooch Friends is a Yahoo social group for getting to know one another outside the trading environment
*BookMooch Barter  - where members can swap things other than books
*BookMooch Lottery – an occasional activity where members pool points.  Half the pool goes to a random selection of members; half to charity.

Under discussion is a member-run Bank of BookMooch where members who are short of points can borrow and repay them later.  Members also write documentation and help features and maintain the BookMooch Wiki.

The site has an [[API]] allowing developers to create their own web applications.

==Transparency==

Transparency of behaviour is a key component of BookMooch.  Recipients of books assign feedback to each transaction and a history for each member is open to view.  A balanced ratio of mooching to giving must be maintained by each member in order to continue to receive books. Both the forums and the feedback/e-mail systems generally allow users to resolve any differences amicably.

==Income==

BookMooch is a [[for-profit corporation]] wholly owned by Buckman, but it does not charge membership or use fees. Revenue is generated from users' voluntary fiscal contributions and from commissions when users purchase a book from Amazon.com through referral by the site. As of December 2006, for approximately every 30 books mooched, one book is purchased from Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2006/12/14/some-stats-for-bookmooch-about-amazon-book-sales/ |title=some stats for BookMooch about Amazon book sales « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208092150/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2006/12/14/some-stats-for-bookmooch-about-amazon-book-sales/ |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De vulgari eloquentia.tif|thumb|''De vulgari eloquentia'', 1577]]
'''''De vulgari eloquentia''''' ({{IPA-la|de vulˈɡari eloˈkwentsi.a|church}}, {{IPA-la|deː wʊɫˈɡaːriː eːɫɔˈkᶣɛnti.aː|classical}}; {{IPA-it|de vulˈɡaːri eloˈkwɛntsja|lang}}; "On eloquence in the [[vernacular]]") is the title of a [[Latin]] essay by [[Dante Alighieri]]. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.

In the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and [[vernacular]], and the search for an "illustrious" vernacular in the [[Italy|Italian]] area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the ''canto'' or song (also spelled ''[[canzone|canzuni]]'' in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), which is a [[literary genre]] developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.

Latin essays were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the [[philosophy]] of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.

==Structure==
Dante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the [[comic genre]] and the "mediocre" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.

==Content==
In the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of [[language]], which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the [[Tower of Babel]]. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the [[Greek language]]s; one to the north, with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': [[Occitan language|oc language]], [[Langue d'oïl|oïl language]] and [[Italian language|sì language]]. He then discusses ''gramatica'', "[[grammar]]", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the [[natural language]]s. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the [[illustrious vernacular]], among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.

==Models==
Dante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' by [[Horace]], the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' by an anonymous author, and ''[[De Inventione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries  that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one.  The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that "the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian". 

The major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably ''Razos de trobar'' by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[troubadour]] [[Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun]] and the ''Vers e regles de trobar'', an amplification of Vidal's manual, by [[Jofre de Foixà]].{{sfn|Ewert|1940|page=357}}{{sfn|Weiss|1942|page=160 n1}} Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: {{lang|it|A perpetuale infamia e depressione delli malvagi uomini d'Italia, che commendano lo volgare altrui, e lo loro proprio dispregiano, dico...}},{{sfn|Graham-Leigh|2005|pages=32 and n130}} meaning "To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say..." (''[[Convivio]]'', treatise I, XI).

Directly or indirectly, Dante came to read [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s works, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]'' by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]], [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]'s works and some [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]] like the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] and the ''[[Livre du Tresor]]'' by [[Brunetto Latini]]. He takes also inspiration from [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as [[Radical Aristotelianism]] can be found in Dante's work.

[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

The '''Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4292}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt; Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Background==
A similar bill was passed by the House during the [[112th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=lawyersCHP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalheritagelaw.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1842909|publisher=The Lawyers' Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4292sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act would amend the federal judicial code with respect to denial of a foreign state's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. or state courts (under the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]) in cases where rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property (or any property exchanged for it) is: (1) present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on by the foreign state in the United States; or (2) owned by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state, and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit consideration as a commercial activity (excluded from jurisdictional immunity) any activity in the United States of a foreign state, or of any carrier, associated with a temporary exhibition or display if: (1) the work of art (or other object of cultural significance) is imported into the United States from any foreign country pursuant to an agreement for its temporary exhibition or display between a foreign state that is its owner or custodian and the United States or cultural or educational institutions within it; and (2) the [[President of the United States|President]] has determined, with notice in the [[Federal Register]], that such work is culturally significant and its temporary exhibition or display is in the national interest. (Thus, grants jurisdictional immunity to the foreign state and associated carrier for such works.)&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would deny application of this prohibition to cases concerning rights in property taken in violation of international law in which: (1) the action is based upon a claim that the work was taken between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, by the government of Germany or any government in Europe occupied, assisted, or allied by the German government; (2) the court determines that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial; and (3) that determination is necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 2, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4292&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4292|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45296|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on information provided by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4292 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 4292 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest. However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts. H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

H.R. 4292 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on March 25, 2014 by [[Steve Chabot|Rep. Steve Chabot (R, OH-1)]].&lt;ref name=4292allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref name="4292allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill "narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries."&lt;ref name=4292gop&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4292|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4292-the-foreign-cultural-exchange-jurisdictional-immunity-clarification-act/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were "taken in violation of international law by [[Nazi Germany]] between January 30, 1933 and [[Victory in Europe Day|May 8, 1945]]."&lt;ref name="4292gop"/&gt;

In an editorial, [[Tess Davis]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Marc Masurovsky]] of the [[Holocaust Art Restitution Project]], spoke out in opposition to the bill.&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;{{cite news|title=US bill would allow museums to knowingly exhibit stolen art|url=http://theconversation.com/us-bill-would-allow-museums-to-knowingly-exhibit-stolen-art-25637|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Conversation|date=2 May 2014|author=Tess Davis|author2=Marc Masurovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would "prevent claimants from recovering their rightful property" and enable museums to "knowingly be able to exhibit stolen and looted art and antiquities."&lt;ref name="Davis1"/&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would weaken U.S. law and undermine the American tradition of honoring property rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">'''Free play''' ({{lang-fr|jeu libre}}) is a literary concept from [[Jacques Derrida]]'s 1966 essay, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." In his essay, Derrida speaks of a philosophical "[[Event (philosophy)|event]]" that has occurred to the historic foundation of structure. Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.&lt;br&gt;— "Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 278&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Besides the tension of freeplay with history, there is also the tension of freeplay with presence. Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.&lt;br&gt;—"Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 294&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4660">[[File:Gargee'an in Ahwaz 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gargee'an celebration in [[Contemporary Arts Museum of Ahvaz]].]]
'''Gargee'an''' ({{lang-ar|قرقيعان}}), sometimes spelled as '''Gerga'oon''' (Arabic: قرقاعون), is a semiannual&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the holiday is only celebrated annually, during the month of Ramadan.&lt;/ref&gt; celebration, observed primarily in [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]), [[Iraq]], and the [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan region]] in [[Iran]]. It takes place on the 15th night of the [[Islamic month]] of [[Sha'ban]] and on the 15th night of [[Ramadan]]. Gargee'an is marked with children dressing in traditional attire and going door-to-door to receive [[sweets]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s from neighbours, whilst also singing traditional songs. The tradition has existed for hundreds of years and deeply rooted in [[Culture of Eastern Arabia|Gulf culture]].&lt;ref name=BNA&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون من أهم الاحتفالات الرمضانية الشعبية في مملكة البحرين|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/519354|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=[[Bahrain News Agency]]|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the celebration of Gargee'an shares superficial similarities with the [[Halloween]] custom of [[trick-or-treating]], practiced in some western countries, Gargee'an has no connection with horror and no associated origin with Halloween.

== Etymology and Alternative Names ==
The exact origin of the word ''Qarqī'ān'' is unknown though several theories exist; One such theory states that it is derived from ''Qarqa'ah'' ({{lang-ar|قرقعة}}), which means ''click'' or ''snick'', the sound of iron pots carrying the sweets hitting each other while serving the sweets.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; Another theory says that it could originate from the kids of [[Medina]] singing "Qarrat Al-'Ain, Qarrat Al-'Ain" ([[Arabic]]: قرة العين) which was changed with time to ''Qarqī'ān''.

The holiday is also known by several different names in each region: Majeena or Karkiaan in [[Iraq]], Garangao or Garangaou in [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], Karkee'aan or Qariqaan in [[Saudi Arabia]], Gargee'aan in [[Kuwait]], Garangashoch, At-Tablah or Qarnakosh in [[Oman]], and Hag Al Leylah in [[the UAE]].

==Religious significance==
Both Gerga'oon nights are significant to both Sunni and [[Shia]] Muslims. Gerga'oon on the 15th of Sha'ban marks the birthday of Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the 12th [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="نسائية سار الرياضي" تقيم مهرجان القرقاعون الأول|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/2170/news/read/162488/1.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerga'oon on the 15th of Ramadan coincides with the birth of Imam [[Hasan ibn Ali]], the second Imam in [[Shia Islam]]. As a result, the occasion is seen as a time of happiness and festivities by Shia Muslims, particularly in [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name=Wasat&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون: البحرين تحيي ليلة النصف من رمضان|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/75/news/read/122551/1.html|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=20 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events during the night include religious sermons conducted by [[mosque]]s, [[carnival]]-like attractions in much of the capital cities of the Persian Gulf region, such as in [[Manama]] and [[Doha]].&lt;ref name=Wasat/&gt;

==Tradition==
Children gather in small [[choir]] groups in front of a home and sing. The song is intended to call on [[Allah|God]] to bless the youngest child of the family, to keep him or her healthy that the mother will remain happy. The more they sing, the more nuts and sweets they receive. The Qarqee'an tradition is intended to spread love, happiness and affection among adults and children.

In modern times, supermarkets, corporates, and malls compete to attract children during this time via advertising in newspapers and on TV, and by offering special promotions and arranging closed Qarqee'an events to market themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="البحرين سيتي سنتر" يحتفل بليلة القرقاعون مساء اليوم|url=http://www.alayam.com/newsdetails.aspx?id=86247|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Ayam|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garth William Smith''' (born June 8, 1960) is a pianist/composer/musician accomplished in several styles of [[music]] including [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], [[classical music|classical]] and [[jazz music|jazz]].  His current endeavor is creating spiritually uplifting [[piano]] arrangements of popular [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|LDS Hymns]].  He resides in [[Oceanside, California]] and is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601511/Whats-New-Sacred-Hymns-is-a-moving-CD.html?pg=all Deseret News 22-April-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmomswhoblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/beautiful-new-cd-hymns-by-garth-smith.html Mormon Moms Who Blog 04 Apr 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life and education ==
Garth was born in [[Brigham City, Utah]], the son of a senior executive chemical engineer working at [[Thiokol]], G. Ray and JoAnne (Petty) Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865634109/Whats-new-How-Beautiful-Thy-Temples-brings-a-spirit-of-peace.html?pg=all Deseret News 8 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; After taking a short break to serve a mission to the [[Navajo]] people of [[Northern Arizona]], Garth completed a college degree in Design Engineering Technology from [[Brigham Young University]], graduating in the class of 1988.  Afterwards, Garth accepted a position at [[Intergraph Corporation]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Later he moved to [[Carlsbad, California]] to accept a design position with [[Callaway Golf]].

== Music career ==

Garth began his classical musical training on the piano at the age of 5.  As a missionary and college student he would entertain many with his piano skills, including a special performance of [[Piano sonatas (Beethoven)|a Beethoven sonata]] to over 15,000 people in the BYU Marriott Center at his college graduation.

He has been a member of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and the [[Nashville Songwriters Association International]]. In 1999 he was the recipient of the California Country Music Association (CCMA) "Song of the Year" award for the song "Last Call." He has also performed as a keyboardist in jazz, rock, and country bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith/ MormonMusic Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nashville Era ===
While living in Alabama, Garth was introduced "Writers in the Round" at the famous [[Bluebird Cafe]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], a club famous for intimate, acoustic music performed by its composers.  Soon, Garth was active participant there, performing his own original compositions.

Garth also participated as both a rehearsal and performance pianist in the local community theaters of Huntsville.  He also joined in various local bands touring throughout Northern Alabama and Southern Tennessee.  They also participated in local music festivals including Huntsville's annual [[Panoply Arts Festival]].

=== California Era ===
Relocating to [[Southern California]] in 1996, Garth continued playing in country bands, as well as developing his songwriting abilities. His bands have played at many popular venues such as the [[Viejas Casino]] and the [[San Diego County Fair]].

== LDS Hymns ==
By 2014, Garth had turned his music to creating artistic arrangements of popular [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|gospel hymns]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], producing several albums, music videos and other related works.  His work is available through [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Books]].
 
=== Album #1: Sacred Hymns ===
Recently Garth has turned his attention to recording original arrangements of popular LDS Hymns, releasing this first album in 2014 titled ''Sacred Hymns Arranged and Performed on the Piano''.  This has received great acclaim and wide national distribution within the LDS music genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmag.com/article-1-14272/ Meridian Magazine 27 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Album #2: Temples ===
For his second full-length album, ''How Beautiful Thy Temples, Sacred Hymns, Vol. II'' (released in 2015), Garth brings his masterful, reverent signature style to bear on hymns and sacred songs that focus on the beauty and eternal significance of temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldssmile.com/2015/05/07/review-of-how-beautiful-thy-temples-sacred-hymns-vol-ii-by-garth-smith/ LDS SMILE 07 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been his most successful release yet, having charted nationally at #21 on the iTunes Gospel new music chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Crawford Gates]], famous LDS composer, has called "How Beautiful Thy Temples" a "fabulous recording." Smith's arrangement of Gates' beloved Easter hymn "He is Not Here" (from "The Choirbook") is included as track 8 on the album.

From "An Angel From on High," an arrangement inspired by the statue of the Angel Moroni that sits atop many temples, to the children's songbook classic "I Love To See the Temple". It's the perfect music to set the tone around your home on the Sabbath or to invite the Spirit more fully into your life day-to-day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #3: Great Redeemer ===
On 01-Sept-2016, Garth released his third album of [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS Hymn arrangements]], a collection of fresh, new arrangements of about the Saviour, [[Jesus Christ]], titled ''Behold the Great Redeemer, Sacred Hymns, Vol. III.''  A new addition is the release of his original sheet music so that now other experienced pianists can perform this genre music in church worship services and other religious settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsliving.com/LDS-Pianist-Garth-Smith-Releases-Christ-Centered-Album/s/83007 LDSLiving.com Behold the Great Redeemer]&lt;/ref&gt;   Selections include ''[[Lead, Kindly Light]],'' ''In Humility our Saviour,'' and another [[Crawford Gates]] masterpiece, ''Our Saviour's Love''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bottom line is this—Smith’s music takes you to a place of serenity, an escape from the world for a moment, and provides the listener with beautiful arrangements that point to the Savior."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #4: A Sacred Christmas ===
Released in time for the 2017 [[Christmas| Christmas season]], ''A Sacred Christmas'', this album features a variety of his favorite hymns that commemorate the birth of the Saviour.  This album features several guest artists, Calee Reed, Michael Dowdle, [[One Voice Children's Choir]], Sun Valley Carolers and others that add an extra layer of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith Mormon Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music Firesides ===
He frequently travels the country performing free, inspirational [[Fireside (LDS Church)|music firesides]].  His 60 minute presentation explores gospel principles found in 8 hymns that includes [[Restorationism|the restoration]], [[prayer]], [[sacrament]], [[forgiveness]], and most importantly, the [[atonement]] of Jesus Christ.

The multimedia presentation features a Christ-centered narrative, live piano, video clips from prophets and apostles, and artwork from other LDS artists.

=== Gospel Music Videos ===
Garth's piano is a backdrop featured in many gospel music videos produced directly by or for the LDS Church, including the church's recent [[#LIGHTtheWORLD]] Christmas season service message. The most popular of these videos is the [[Heaven's Hallelujah]] arrangement featuring vocalist [[Lauren Sullivan]]. Many of these are accessible for free on their [[YouTube Channel]].

[[File:Heroico1.jpg|thumb|300px|The original image, from which the popularized portrait was derived. By cropping out a palm tree and the profile of another man, and making other slight adjustments, Korda gave Guevara's image "an ageless quality, divorced from the specifics of time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer's Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''Guerrillero Heroico''''' ({{lang-en|"Heroic Guerrilla Fighter"}}) is an [[icon]]ic [[photograph]] of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[revolutionary]] [[Che Guevara]] taken by [[Alberto Korda]]. It was captured on March 5, 1960, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], at a memorial service for victims of the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'' explosion]]. By the end of the 1960s, the image, in conjunction with Guevara's subsequent actions and eventual execution, helped solidify the charismatic and controversial leader as a cultural icon.&lt;ref name="CNNCasey"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/05/05/argentina.che.photo/ Communists, Capitalists still buy into Iconic Che Photo, Author says] by Brian Byrnes, ''[[CNN]]'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Korda has said that at the moment he shot the picture, he was drawn to Guevara's facial expression, which showed "absolute implacability"&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 465&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anger and pain.&lt;ref name="Ziff15"&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Korda would say that the photograph showed Che's firm and stoic character.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara was 31 years old at the time the photograph was taken.

Emphasizing the image's ubiquitous nature and wide appeal, the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] called the picture a symbol of the 20th century and the world's most famous photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News, "Che Guevara photographer dies", May 26, 2001. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Online at BBC News], accessed January 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of it have been painted, printed, digitized, embroidered, tattooed, silk-screened, sculpted or sketched on nearly every surface imaginable, leading the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] to say that the photograph has been reproduced more than any other image in photography.&lt;ref name="va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1541_che/index.html?page=the_exhibition.html |title=V&amp;A: The story of an image, exhibition organised by UCR/California Museum of Photography |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California, Riverside California Museum of Photography|UCR/California Museum of Photography]], has speculated that "Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn’t anything else in history that serves in this way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.net/reviews/Che.html |title=Che as revolutionary and icon, by Corinna Lotz |publisher=Aworldtowin.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history and contemporary global impact of the image is the basis for the 2008 documentary ''[[Chevolution]]'', directed by Trisha Ziff,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 DVD Review: Chevolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214002912/http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 |date=2010-02-14 }} by David Van Der Haeghen, ''DVD Town'', January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; along with the 2009 book ''Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image'' by Michael Casey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer’s Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Che Guevara (third from left) and Fidel Castro (far left) marching to Colón Cemetery.]]
On March 4, 1960, the French freighter [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] suspiciously exploded in [[Havana Harbor]], killing up to 100 people and injuring several hundred more.&lt;ref name="JLA442"&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 442&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the blast, Guevara rushed to the harbor to board the burning ship, angrily forcing his way past those concerned for his safety following a secondary explosion.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt;

The following day on March 5, President [[Fidel Castro]] blamed the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and called for a memorial service and mass demonstration at Havana's [[Colon Cemetery, Havana|Colón Cemetery]], to honor the victims.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt; At the time, Guevara was Minister of Industry in the new government, and Korda was Castro's official photographer. After a funeral march along the seafront boulevard known as [[Malecón, Havana|Malecón]], Fidel Castro gave a eulogy for the fallen at a stage on 23rd street.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit"&gt;[http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001-Caribbean-Vol-2/Obit:_Alberto_Korda_(Times_of_London) Obit: Alberto Korda] [[The Times]], May 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Castro gave a fiery speech, using the words ''"Patria o Muerte"'' ("Homeland or Death") for the first time.&lt;ref name="LAHT50" /&gt;  Meanwhile, at 11:20&amp;nbsp;am, Guevara came into view for a few seconds. Korda snapped just two frames of him from a distance of about {{Convert|25|–|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} before he disappeared from sight.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt; Korda immediately realised his photograph had the attributes of a portrait.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20071007/ai_n21035836 |title=''The Making of an Icon: Forty Years'', Sunday Herald, Oct 7 2007 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= October 7, 2007|accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Korda said of this photograph, "I remember it as if it were today … seeing him framed in the viewfinder, with that expression. I am still startled by the impact … it shakes me so powerfully".&lt;ref name="va" /&gt;

[[File:KordaFilmRollChe.jpg|250px|thumb|Korda's film contact sheet. ''Guerrillero Heroico'' appears on the fourth row down, third picture over (shot horizontally).]]
[[File:KordaFilmRollChe detail.jpg|250px|thumb|The two photographs of Che from Korda's film.]]
During the rally, Korda took pictures of Cuban dignitaries and famous French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], both admirers of Guevara at the time. Included in the film roll were shots of all the speakers and two pictures of Che's brief appearance. The classic picture appears on frame number 40 shot horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emiliobrizzi.blogspot.com/2007/02/el-guerrillero-heroico-1960.html "El Guerrillero Heroico (1960)"] by Emilio Brizzi, On Photography And More, February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first photograph had Guevara framed alone between the silhouette of [[Jorge Masetti]] and a palm tree; the second with someone's head appearing above his shoulder. The first picture, with the intruding material cropped out and the image rotated slightly, became Guevara's most famous portrait. The editor of ''Revolución'' where Korda worked, decided to use only his shots of Castro, Sartre, and Beauvoir, while sending the Che shot back to Korda. Believing the image was powerful, Korda made a cropped version for himself, which he enlarged and hung on his wall next to a portrait of the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]],&lt;ref name="LAHT50"&gt;[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=353283&amp;CategoryId=14510 Iconic Photo of Che Guevara Now Half a Century Old] by the ''[[Latin American Herald Tribune]]'', March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave copies to some others as a gift. It was not until 1986 that José Figueroa, an established photographer in his own right who printed for Korda and was his unofficially "adopted" son, suggested they try printing the full frame version of the portrait. Korda continued to print both versions of the image up until his death.&lt;ref name="introduction2005"&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/exhibitions/che/essay_002.htm Introduction: Korda's Che Moves Out into the World] by Trisha Ziff, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leica M2 Summicron 35.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Leica M2]]

To take the photograph, Korda used a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] [[Leica M2|M2]] with a 90&amp;nbsp;mm lens, loaded with [[Kodak]] [[Kodak Plus-X|Plus-X]] pan film. In speaking about the method, Korda remarked that "this photograph is not the product of knowledge or technique. It was really coincidence, pure luck."&lt;ref name="ArtH"&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/photography/Alberto-Korda.html Alberto Korda at The Art History Archive] by Brandi Leigh, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alberto Korda ==

As a lifelong [[communist]] and supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution]] until his death, [[Alberto Korda]] claimed no payment for his picture. A modified version of the portrait through the decades was also reproduced on a range of different media, though Korda never asked for [[royalties]]. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. Korda's refusal to seek royalties for the vast circulation of his photograph "helped it become the ultimate symbol of Marxist revolution and anti-imperialist struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2010/03/che-guevara-alberto-korda Cuba, 5 March 1960: Alberto Korda] by Ian K Smith, ''[[New Statesman]]'', April 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when in response to [[Smirnoff]] using Che's picture in a vodka commercial, Korda claimed his [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] (a form of [[copyright law]]) and sued advertising agency Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/07/cuba.mattwells After 40 Years and Millions of Posters, Che's Photographer Sues for Copyright] by Matt Wells, ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lintas and Rex claimed that the image was in the [[public domain]]. The final result was an out of court settlement for USD $50,000 to Korda,&lt;ref&gt;Ariana Hernández-Reguant, Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism, Public Culture 2004 v. 16 pp. 1–30. pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; which he donated to the Cuban healthcare system, stating "if Che was still alive, he would have done the same."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=90 Cuba's Che Photographer Korda Dies in Paris] by Andrew Cawthorne, ''[[Reuters]]'', May 25, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement, Korda reiterated that he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:

{{quote|"As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world, but I am categorically against the exploitation of Che's image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt; }}

== Giangiacomo Feltrinelli ==
Passed out to the occasional friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]] in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor [[Régis Debray]]. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by [[Che Guevara]]. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution he did not have to pay.

Upon his return to Italy, Feltrinelli disseminated thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later in 1967 after his October 9, 1967 execution, Che's ''Bolivian Diary'' with Korda's photograph on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, crediting the copyright to (c) Libreria Feltrinelli 1967 (in the lower left hand corner of the image) with no mention of Korda.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt; By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Alberto Korda later expounded that if Feltrinelli had paid him just one lira for each reproduction, that he would have received millions. However, Korda also expressed that he forgave him, because through his actions, the image became famous.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt;

=== Milan 1967 ===
Feltrinelli's version of the image was used in October 1967 in [[Milan]], Italy, when spontaneous protests occurred in response to the news of Che's death. Italian photographer Giorgio Mondolfo later stated that "the first time I saw the picture by Alberto Korda, I was not even slightly interested in the author. I was only fifteen, and it was the picture that had drawn us – many for the first time – to gather in the streets, crying ''Che lives!''"&lt;ref&gt;The 150th Anniversary of Photography catalogue, an exhibition curated by Guiliana Scimè, Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Paris Match'' ===
''Guerrillero Heroico'' also appeared in the August 1967 issue of ''[[Paris Match]]''. Published only a few months before his eventual capture and execution, the issue featured a major article titled "Les Guerrilleros" by journalist Jean Lartéguy. Lartéguy wrote "At a time when Cuban revolutionaries want to create [[Vietnam War|Vietnams]] all over the world, the Americans run the risk of finding their own [[Algerian War|Algeria]] in Latin America."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended by asking "Where is Che Guevara?" The caption of the photograph read "The official photograph of Che Guevara; on his beret the star, the symbol of the Comandante."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt; It is not known who provided the magazine with the image, and it was also not credited to Feltrinelli. However, with its wide circulation throughout Europe, and its status as an influential news journal, ''Paris Match'' could also be viewed as one of the original purveyors of the image.

=== Riots ===
During the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 Paris student riots]], which eventually shook the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] government (but did not overthrow it), organizer [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit|"Danny The Red"]] utilized Fitzpatrick's rendition of Che during the protests. At this time, Che's image was picked up by the Dutch anarchist group [[Provo (movement)|"The Provos"]] in Amsterdam, who focused on triggering violent responses from authorities through non-violent means.

== Jim Fitzpatrick ==
[[File:FitzpatrickChe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original 1968 stylized image created by Jim Fitzpatrick.]]

In 1967, Irish artist [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] was also using Korda's image as a basis for creating his own stylized posters.  Fitzpatrick claims he received a copy of the photograph from the Dutch anarchist group "the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]", who produced a magazine bearing the group's name. Fitzpatrick remembers that Provo magazine claimed the image originally came to Europe via [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Fitzpatrick's source of the image, then, would not have been Feltrinelli.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt;

{{quote|"The first image I did of Che was psychedelic, it looks like he is in seaweed. His hair was not hair, it was shapes that I felt gave it an extra dimension. That was the image I produced for the magazine and that was done before he died and that is the important thing about that image. At first it did not print. It was considered far too strong and revolutionary. I was very inspired by Che's trip to Bolivia. He went there with the intent to overthrow the intensely corrupt government, helped by the Americans at the time, and that's where he died. I thought he was one of the greatest men who ever lived and I still do in many ways. And when he was murdered, I decided I wanted to do something about it, so I created the poster. I felt this image had to come out, or he would not be commemorated otherwise, he would go where heroes go, which is usually into anonymity."| Jim Fitzpatrick, 2005&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;}}

To create the image Fitzpatrick made a paper negative on a piece of equipment called a grant. They were then printed in one color black and one color red, and he handpainted the star in yellow. Fitzpatrick "wanted the image to breed like rabbits" and hand printed thousands of images to give away to anyone for free in London, in addition to getting friends to pass them out while encouraging others to make their own versions. He printed about a hundred copies at a time to fulfill the demand of political groups in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands who began requesting the image. A batch was also sent to Spain, where they were seized by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s police.

Because of the high demand, Fitzpatrick formed a poster company called ''Two Bear Feet'' and produced a variety of posters in 1967 using the Korda image. All of them were created without copyright, because Fitzpatrick wanted them to be reproduced. One of these posters would be published in the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The best-known was printed on silver foil and was exhibited in an exhibition in London called "Viva Che" at the Arts Laboratory, curated by Peter Meyer. This show was originally to be held at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in 1968 and illustrates how fast the image moved from protest into the realm of fine art.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Fitzpatrick's desire for the photograph to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed "F" on the shoulder. It was not until the 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone."&lt;ref name="webstudio.ie"&gt;Artist reveals his guerrilla tactics with iconic image’s secret mark, by Web Studio Ireland, October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Fitzpatrick said that "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine."&lt;ref name="webstudio.ie" /&gt; In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2008/nov/30/the-diary-ken-sweeney-che-and-share-alike-says-jim/ The Diary, Ken Sweeney – Che and Share Alike, says Jim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207122042/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2008/nov/30/the-diary-ken-sweeney-che-and-share-alike-says-jim/ |date=2008-12-07 }} November 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting Guevara in Ireland ===

According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at [[Gormanston College]] he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in [[Kilkee]], the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Knowing about the [[Irish settlement in Argentina|Irish diaspora and history in Argentina]], Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from [[Galway]], with other family being from [[County Cork|Cork]].

Guevara's father also bore the Irish surname "[[Lynch (surname)|Lynch]]." Fitzpatrick describes Che as "curious" about Ireland "from a revolutionary point of view" and remarks that Che proclaimed his "great admiration" for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to "shake off the shackles of the British Empire".&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |title=A phone conversation between Aleksandra Mir and Jim Fitzpatrick, (Dublin), January 3, 2005 |publisher=Aleksandramir.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155355/http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to [[Cuba]], and had touched down at [[Shannon Airport]], where the Soviet airline ''[[Aeroflot]]'' had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an "unofficial" visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia.&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;

In December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the [[Shannon Development]], announced plans to commemorate Guevara's visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in [[Limerick]]. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara's visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a "permanent mark" symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel's – White House pub in [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannonside]]. Fitzpatrick defended the move by remarking "we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here … this probably was Che's last hurrah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickleader.ie/features/Marking-Che-Guevaras-Limerick-link.4763656.jp Marking Che Guevara's Limerick Link] ''Limerick Leader'', December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinn Féin]] president [[Gerry Adams]] is interviewed in the 2008 documentary ''Chevolution'' about the famous photograph. As he speaks, the film shows a montage of Che murals in [[Belfast]], with Adams remarking "I suppose people from my background were drawn to that image, because of what Che Guevara represented."&lt;ref name="IrishC" /&gt;

== Cuba ==
[[File:SculptureCheGuevaraCuba.jpg|thumb|right|Plaza de la Revolución – in Havana, Cuba]]

Cuban historian Edmundo Desnoes has stated that "Che's image may be cast aside, bought and sold and deified, but it will form a part of the universal system of the revolutionary struggle, and can recover its original meaning at any moment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html "Shaykh Che Guevara"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507121101/http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html |date=2008-05-07 }} Q-News, July 2006, Issue 367, pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; That meaning's origin harkens back to when Korda's photograph was first published on April 16, 1961, in the daily Cuban newspaper ''Revolución'', advertising a noon conference during which the main speaker was "Dr. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara." The conference was disrupted however, when 1,300 CIA-supported counter-revolutionaries stormed the beaches of Cuba, in what became known as the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]. The image was thus republished a second time advertising the newly convened conference on April 28, 1961. Because of this fact, it seems very likely that in the context of both of these publications, that Che could have seen the photograph that would later contribute to his iconic status.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first time Cubans on a large scale became familiar with the photograph, despite its earlier reproduction in ''Revolución'', was on hearing the news of Che's death. Upon the news of Che's execution, it was enlarged and draped on a banner down the five-story building of the Ministry of the Interior in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] in [[Havana]]. This building where Che himself had formerly worked, served as a backdrop to [[Fidel Castro|Fidel's]] eulogy on October 18, 1967, publicly acknowledging the death of Che Guevara before a crowd of over a million mourners. José Gómez Fresquet, renowned Cuban poster maker and graphic artist, recalls how on hearing the news of Guevara's death, he immediately worked all night producing the poster to be used at the rally honoring him the next day. Korda had given Fresquet a copy of the portrait as a basis for the poster, which he created on red paper. This was the first privately produced ''Guerrillero Heroico'' to be created in Cuba. Since then the building has seen many versions of the image, and today a permanent steel outline, derived from the photograph, adorns the building.&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt;

== The United States and fame ==
''Guerrillero Heroico'' made its American debut in 1968 on [[New York City Subway]] billboards, when the image appeared in painted form by [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]], for a poster advertising the February issue of [[Evergreen Review]].&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 22&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Davis has stated that he was "inspired by Italian paintings of martyred saints and Christ", in his romanticised version of Che.&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22" /&gt;

{{quote|"Che was the revolutionary as rock star. Korda, as a fashion photographer, sensed that instinctively, and caught it. Before then, the Nazis were the only political movement to understand the power of glamour and sexual charisma, and exploit it. The communists never got it. Then you have the Cuban revolution, and into this void come these macho guys with straggly hair and beards and big-dick glamour, and suddenly [[Norman Mailer]] and all the radical chic crowd are creaming their jeans. Che had them in the palm of his hand, and he knew it. What he didn’t know, of course, was how much that image would define him."| [[Lawrence Osborne]], ''[[New York Observer]]'', 2003 &lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the fascination was not solely an American phenomenon. For instance, British journalist [[Richard Gott]] who met with Che Guevara several times expressed a similar view, by stating how he was "struck by his magnetic physical attraction, comparable to the aura of a rock star." In Gott's opinion "almost everyone had the same impression, and journalists were particularly susceptible."&lt;ref name="thehindu2006"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/05/stories/2006060506501100.htm The story of the iconic image of Che Guevara] by Richard Gott, ''The Hindu'', June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in an August 8, 1960, cover story after meeting with Guevara displayed this view, by remarking that Che wore "a smile of melancholy sweetness that many women find devastating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,869742,00.html Castro's Brain] by ''[[Time magazine]]'', August 8, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argentina|Argentine]] journalist Julia Costenlos, recalls that in her view he was "blessed with a unique appeal, an incalculable enchantment that came completely naturally."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jun/03/art.art "Poster Boy"] by Richard Gott, The Guardian, June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Ambassador K Gajendra Singh, posted in 1965 as a young diplomat in [[Algiers]], recalls his own similar personal encounter with meeting Guevara; describing him as "indisputably the dazzling star of the show" and compared shaking his hand at an economic seminar to "getting an autograph of a celebrity." According to Singh, Che's "charismatic presence in green olive fatigues and black beret" at the time embodied "the very best of the Hollywood and Bollywood stars all rolled into one"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9324 A Meeting with Che Guevara] by K Gajendra Singh, Global Research, June 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Even under duress, ''[[The Times]]'' journalist Henry Brandon, who spoke with Guevara at the height of the [[Cuban missile crisis]], remarked that Che possessed a "genial charm" that "might have made [[Charles Boyer]] envious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5062895.ece From the archive: Attack us at your peril, cocky Cuba warns US] ''Times'' Online, November 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In judging the enduring appeal of the image, Darrel Couturier, representative for Korda since 1997, has opined that it was "the image of a very dashing young man" and that in the "age of free love and flower power … the time was ripe for a figure" or "image that could represent this great diversity in thinking and behavior the world over." According to Couturier, this "age of religious revolution", matched with Guevara's premature death, "elevated him to almost [[martyrdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=156339 ‘Korda’s Che from Revolution to Icon’ travels to İstanbul] by Rumeysa Kiger, ''Today's Zaman'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"When you look closely, you can see that many iconic photographs are constructed in the same way; it is possible to copy the formula. Look at some of the most enduring images of our age … Like Che, they are shot from below against a light background, giving them a raised, Godlike quality. The angle of the shot is particularly crucial, as profiles have little impact and full frontals tend to flatten the features. The direction and intensity of the subject's gaze is also key. Che is looking past the camera, out to his vision. His line of vision has been much tinkered with by various artists, but it retains its passion even on a table mat or a screensaver. An image like this is about a sign: it's a shorthand. This particular one now stands for opposition to the establishment, freedom and revolution."| [[Alison Jackson]], photographer and filmmaker &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/print/200606120036 Che: The Artists View] by [[Alison Jackson]], ''[[New Statesman]]'', June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As pop artists took to the image with glee, it evolved into a popular and heavily commercialized icon that often strayed far from Che’s hard-line [[Marxist]] message.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt; British [[pop artist]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]] has referred to ''Guerrillero Heroico'' as "one of the great icons of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="guardian2004"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/11/features.review Just a Pretty Face?] by Sean O'Hagan, ''The Observer'', July 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  When converted into a stark black cut-out, Korda's photograph became easy, cheap, and fast to copy using the favored material and method of the 1960s: lith film and screen painting.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in 1967, Che was already "a legend, the romantic epitome of worldwide rebellion" and in the wake of his perceived martyrdom, Korda's photograph went viral.&lt;ref name="Alook"&gt;A look at Che Guevara through the Lens of his Iconic Image, by Robert W.

According to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], "the photograph enshrines Che as a mythic hero. Taken from below, the revolutionary leader with searching eyes and resolute expression becomes larger than life. A perspective that dominates the imagery of social realism, it bears an irresistible aura of authority, independence and defiance."&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The V&amp;A Museum goes on to state that Korda's famous photograph first [[Apotheosis|deified]] Che and turned him into an [[icon]] of [[radical chic]]. Its story, a complex mesh of conflicting narratives, gave ''Guerrillero Heroico'' a life of its own, an enduring fascination independent of Che himself.&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The Italian magazine ''Skime'' evokes even more praise, decreeing it "absolutely the most famous of history" while proclaiming that it "captures beauty and youth, courage and generosity, aesthetic and moral virtues of a person who possessed all the characteristics necessary to be converted into a symbol of an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] like ours, lacking in historic legends and mythic incarnations."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 41&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Richard Gott]] has also remarked that "the red star in Che's beret was up there with '[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]].{{' "}}&lt;ref name="thehindu2006" /&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California Riverside|UCR]] photography museum, has remarked that "pop art is a rejection of traditional figuration, rhetoric, and rendition. Its egalitarian anti-art stance was the perfect corollary for Che's anti-establishment attitude."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzpatrick's graphic was later used in a 1968 painting attributed to [[Andy Warhol]] and sold to a gallery in Rome. The painting used the same graphic processes used on the acclaimed [[Marilyn Monroe]] pieces. However this painting was a forgery, created by [[Gerard Malanga]] who was in need of money. When Warhol heard of the fraud, he "authenticated" the fake, provided that all the money from sales went to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, David. ''"Warhol"''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1989 pg 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisha Ziff, the curator of ''Che!

For decades the famous image was unhindered by [[international copyright agreements]], because Cuba was not a signatory to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. [[Fidel Castro]] described it as a "[[bourgeois]] concept" which meant that artists and advertisers were free to use Korda’s work as they pleased.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/05/che-the-birthday-of-a-revolutionary-brand/ Che: The Birthday of a Revolutionary Brand] by Michael J.

Despite conflicting claims about whether or not the image could have copyright established, Korda's children have sought to control commercial use of the image from [[defamation]]. Korda's daughter Diana Diaz pursued a 2003 lawsuit in France against a Paris-based press rights group [[Reporters Without Borders]], for using the Che photograph in a poster campaign decrying Cuba as "the world's largest jail", aimed at dissuading French tourists from vacationing in Cuba after the jailing of 29 dissident journalists.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005"&gt;Reuters,

Vaver, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-33089-0}}, pg 273–280&lt;/ref&gt; Moral rights aim to protect the integrity of a work from defamation, distortion, slander, or offensive mutilation, even if the originator no longer owns the copyright.&lt;ref name="Vaver" /&gt; However, Reporters Without Borders stopped using the image before any legal judgment was rendered.&lt;ref name="CubaN" /&gt;

Ariana Hernández-Reguant addressed the image's copyright status in 2004 in her article ''Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism''. She expressed a skeptical view towards Korda's heirs being able to establish ownership over the image, noting in reference to the lawsuits involving the image, "There was never any official ruling on whether the depiction constituted a violation of copyright." The author goes on to state that: "Korda took the picture while working for a state-run newspaper, his actual property rights would be questionable under both Cuban and international law."&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez-Reguant, Ariana. "Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism". ''Public Culture'' – Volume 16, Number 1, Winter 2004, pp. 1–29, – pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, law student Sarah Levy also addressed the potential legal status of the image in Cuba. It was her ultimate contention that "in Cuba the copyright protection in Korda's Guevara photograph would have already expired, and despite the claims of ownership from Korda's heirs, the State would now hold any rights associated with the photograph."&lt;ref name="revolution2007"&gt;''"A Copyright Revolution: Protecting the Famous Photograph of Che Guevara"'', by Sarah Levy, 13 Law and Business Review of the Americas, Am. 687. Summer of 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the more commonly disseminated stylized version of the photograph, lawyers say it will be an uphill struggle to deter non-photographic use of such a widely reproduced image, other than in countries like Italy where laws protect image rights.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt;

Guevara's heirs also believe they have legal justification to prevent the image's "exploitation" or [[slander]]. Guevara's Cuban widow Aleida March stated in 2005 that "We have a plan to deal with the misuse. We can't attack everyone with lances like Don Quixote, but we can try to maintain the ethics of Guevara's legacy."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; In reference to this pronouncement, Guevara's daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] told [[Reuters]], "It will be costly and difficult because each country has different laws, but a limit has to be drawn."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; However, the family has not yet mounted any court challenges, and no determination of legal copyright internationally has been established.

Reverend '''Humphrey Gainsborough''' (1718 – 23 August 1776) was an English [[non-conformist]] [[Religious minister|minister]], [[engineer]], and [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tyler, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=Tyler  |first=David
  |title=Humphrey Gainsborough, 1718–1776: Cleric, Engineer and Inventor
  |journal=[[Transactions of the Newcomen Society]]
  |issue=76
  |pages=51–81
  |year=2006}} Read to the [[Newcomen Society]] at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], [[London]], 12 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphrey Gainsborough was [[pastor]] to the Independent Church in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[England]]. He was the brother of the artist [[Thomas Gainsborough]]. He invented the [[drill plough]] (1766), winning a prize of £60 from the [[Royal Society]] for his efforts. He also invented the [[tide mill]] (1761), which allowed a [[mill wheel]] to rotate in either direction, winning a £50 prize from the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society for the Encouragement of Arts]] in [[London]]. In addition, he designed a self-ventilating fish wagon (1762).

[[File:Conway Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 722320.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conway's Bridge]], designed by Humphrey Gainsborough and built in 1763 at [[Park Place (Berkshire)|Park Place]], named after [[Henry Seymour Conway]] (1721–1795)]]
Gainsborough designed [[Conway's Bridge]], built in 1763 at [[Park Place (Berkshire)|Park Place]] close to Henley, an interesting rustic arched stone structure that still carries traffic on the road between [[Wargrave]] and Henley today. In 1768, he improved the slope on the road up the steep White Hill to the east of Henley, straightening it in the process.

In the 1760s, Gainsborough showed a model of a condensing [[steam engine]] to [[James Watt]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Watt had been working independently on improvements to the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen "atmospheric engine"]] and subsequently [[patent]]ed these in 1769. He perhaps included some of – and at least built on – Gainsborough's ideas. Gainsborough is thus probably less well-known than he might have been.

The [[canal lock|lock]], [[weir]] and [[footbridge]] at [[Marsh Lock]], just upstream from Henley on the [[River Thames]], were designed by Gainsborough, together with other early locks from [[Sonning]] to [[Maidenhead]] (1772–73).

A [[blue plaque]] in Gainsborough's honour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/gainsborough.html | title=Humphrey Gainsborough (1718–1776) | publisher=[[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme]] | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be found in the town of [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]] itself on the gates of the Manse, the house where he lived next to the Christ Church [[United Reformed Church]]. Inside he designed an early [[security chain]] and plate on one of the outside doors, allowing the door to be partially opened, that is still there now. Similar designs are used on many people's front doors today.

==Epitaph==
[[Philip Thicknesse]] wrote in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1785:
{{quote|''… one of the most ingenious men that ever lived, and one of the best that ever died … Perhaps of all the mechanical geniuses this or any nation has produced.

The '''Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollak Dance Company''' is an [[State of Israel|Israeli]] [[contemporary dance]] company founded by choreographer [[Inbal Pinto]] and actor [[Avshalom Pollak]], and operates in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel since 1992. Pinto and Pollak are the artistic directors of the company, and are in charge of selecting pieces to represent the company. 

==About the Company==

Since 1992, the company has brought many contemporary danceworks to the stage for all sectors of the population. The uniqueness of their creators is seen through every detail in each piece, for example in choreography, [[staging (theatre)|staging]], the selection of [[soundtracks]], [[costume design]], and prop design. The company has 12 regular [[dancers]] and actors, works and conducts shows at the [[Suzanne Dellal Center]], and is often invited to represent Israel at important [[festivals]] and leading cultural events around the globe. 

The company's first production was the piece ''A Chance for 100'', which was created by the company and Yossi Pollak-Avshalom Pollak's father.

Apart from contemporary dance performances, the company also performs [[operas]] and musicals. For example, in 2006, they performed the opera ''Armid'' by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and again at the [[Israeli Opera]]. In 2013, they performed the play ''The Cat that Lived a Million Times'', based on Yoko Sano's book, in Tokyo, Japan, as well as the opera ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' by [[Leos Janacek]] at the Opera house in [[Bergen]], Norway. 

Throughout the years Pinto and Pollak cooperated with different artists, among them choreographer Robby Barnett, with whom they created the show ''Rushes'' in 2007 for the American contemporary dance company Pilobolus; the Norwegian company "Kitchen Orchestra", created the soundtracks for ''Trout'', which was performed for the first time in [[Stavanger]], Norway in 2008. Other collaborations include the cooperations with choreographer Talya Bek, who created the works ''Sodad'' in 2009 and ''Empire'' in 2010. 

In 2013, illustrators Rony Fahima and Shimrit Alkanti illustrated pictures and animations for the productions of ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' and ''Dust''. Moreover, in 2014, they joined the Japanese Musicians Omitaro Eba, Hirufomi Nakamura, and Mayu Ganto, who had created the music for the show ''Wallflower'' and that Pinto and Pollak had met during their time in Japan working on ''The Cat that Lived a Million Times''. Pinto and Pollak cooperate regularly with French lighting designer Yohan Tiboli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5253">[[Image:Iroquois park.jpg|thumb|275px|View of Downtown Louisville from the overlook atop Iroquois Park]]
'''Iroquois Park''' is a 739-acre (3.0&amp;nbsp;km²) municipal [[park]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States]]. It was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed Louisville's [[Cherokee Park]] and [[Shawnee Park]], at what were then the edges of the city. Located south of downtown, Iroquois Park was promoted as "Louisville's [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]". It is built on a large knob covered with [[old growth forest]], and its most prominent feature are the scenic viewpoints atop the hill.

The summit of Iroquois Park presents an all-at-once vista of the city of Louisville, seen from the south. A bronze plaque at the site demonstrates the plan of the city's park and parkway system as planned and executed by Olmsted's firm.

The park features an [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]], [[basketball]] courts, 18-hole [[golf course]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisvilleky.gov/content/iroquois-golf-course|title=Iroquois Golf Course|work=louisvilleky.gov|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[disc golf]] course and a riding stable. Louisville Metro Parks and partner companies stage concerts, musicals, and other shows each summer at '''Iroquois Amphitheater'''.

==History==
Iroquois Park was one of the three major suburban parks created in the late 19th century in Louisville. In 1889, Mayor [[Charles Donald Jacob]] purchased '''Burnt Knob''', a 313-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract of land 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) south of the city, for $9,000, and was reimbursed by the city treasurer without approval from the city council or public referendum, meaning the original purchase was probably illegal. Jacob also negotiated with landowners between the city and the then-rural park to acquire the right of way for a 150-foot (46 m) wide "Grand Boulevard", today's [[Southern Parkway (Louisville, Kentucky)|Southern Parkway]], which still leads to the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisville's Olmsteadian Legacy|date=1988|last=Kramer|first=Carl|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was controversial at first and called "'''Jacob's Folly'''" by political opponents after early improvements were washed away by rain in the Spring of 1889. In 1890 control over the park, then called '''Jacob's&amp;nbsp;Park''', was given to the Board of Park Commissioners. Frederick Law Olmsted was invited to tour the park, and gave an influential speech at the [[Pendennis Club]] on May 20, 1891, and signed a contract to design the city's park system two days later. Work was soon underway on the park, by then renamed Iroquois, which Olmsted envisioned as "providing the grandeur of the forest depths in the dim seclusion of which you may wander musingly for hours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisville's Olmsteadian Legacy|date=1988|last=Kramer|first=Carl|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lion lights were devised by [[Maasai people|Maasai]] Richard Turere to prevent night attacks by lions on his family's [[cattle]] herd, which was in [[Kitengela]] on the unfenced south side of [[Nairobi National Park]], in [[Kenya]]. These types of attacks often lead to the hunting and killing of the lions, which are endangered.

When Richard Turere was 9 he tried kerosene lamps and [[scarecrow]]s but these proved not to work, but he noticed that the lions did not attack when people were present, and he theorised that they were deterred by moving torchlight. Therefore, Turere &lt;ref name="paula"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXbRO3CcTQ Lion Li/]&lt;/ref&gt; placed LED lights around the perimeter of his family's cow shed, connected them to vehicle indicator flashers, and powered the system from car batteries charged by a solar panel.

The lion attacks ceased and soon neighbours were asking for him to set up similar systems around their farms.&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt; The cattle were also calmer because the lights meant that they could see the land around was safe.

Based on this invention, Turere won a scholarship to [[Brookhouse School]].&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt;

Although originally intended for lions, lion lights may also work for other predators such as [[leopard]]s and [[cheetah]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39409">This is a '''list of gravity hills and magnetic hills''' around the world.

A [[gravity hill]] is a place where a slight downhill slope appears to be an uphill slope due to the layout of the surrounding land, creating the [[optical illusion]] that water flows uphill or that a car left out of gear will roll uphill. Many of these sites have no specific name and are often called just "Gravity Hill", "Magnetic Hill", "Magic Road" or something similar.

'''Magda Sawon''' is a [[Contemporary art gallery|contemporary art gallerist]] and art world figure who founded and owns New York's [[Postmasters Gallery]] (with her husband Tamas Banovich), a gallery for young and established contemporary artists, especially those working in new media, in the [[Tribeca]] neighborhood of New York City.  The gallery is considered to be one of the "leading experimental galleries" in New York City.&lt;ref name=viveros-faune&gt;{{cite news|last=Viveros-Faune|first=Christian|title=How Uptown Money Kills Downtown Art|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-02-06/art/uptown-money-kills-downtown-art/3/|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early career ==
Magdalena Sawon came to Manhattan from [[Poland]] in 1981, having studied art history with an emphasis in [[Japonism]] in Warsaw, earning a Master's degree.&lt;ref name="Fensterstock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Fensterstock|title=Art on the Block: Tracking the New York Art World from SoHo to the Bowery, Bushwick and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X83AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271|date=17 September 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-27849-4|pages=271–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a job in a shoe store, and emboldened by a class she took at the [[New School]] taught by Estelle Schwartz, she struck out with partner Tamas Banovich, opening an art gallery in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on Avenue A between 4th and 5th Streets&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanfranco|first=Katerina|title=tArt roundtable discussion with Magda Sawon at Postmasters Gallery|url=http://tartblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/tart-roundtable-discussion-with-magda-sawon-postmasters-gallery/|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1984.&lt;ref name="gallery website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Postmasters Gallery|url=http://www.postmastersart.com/gallery_window.html|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of the gallery referenced being "post" the European masters, alludes to Postmodernism, and also points to an early interest in [[mail art]] and its distribution by the postal service.&lt;ref name="Fensterstock2013" /&gt;

In 1988, Sawon and Banovich moved Postmasters Gallery to a [[Soho]] loft space at Greene and Spring Streets.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=ART VIEW; The Gallery Is the Message|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/04/arts/art-view-the-gallery-is-the-message.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the gallery was relocated to Chelsea (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friend|first=David|title=Watching the World Change: The Stories Behind the Images of 9/11|date=2011|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933155|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3YQIY1ShFYC&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=%22Magda%20Sawon%22&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tribeca in October 2013.&lt;ref name="gallery website" /&gt; Sawon lived in the East Village and Chelsea prior to her move to Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Claire|title=Turning the High Line Into the High Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/realestate/18cover.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Sawon sold a work from her gallery (by artists [[Jennifer &amp; Kevin McCoy|Jennifer and Kevin McCoy]]) to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], which she described as a highlight of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph-Hunter|first=Galen|title=Electronic Arts Intermix - Conversation with Magda Sawon|url=http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/collection/computer/interview_sawon.html|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contributions==
In addition to her directorial and curatorial activities at Postmasters Gallery, Sawon was elected to the board of [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press:Rhizome.org Elects Magdalena Sawon to Board of Directors|url=http://rhizome.org/discuss/2409/|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also is a founding member of [http://www.seven-miami.com/ SEVEN] art fair,&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; started in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">The '''Modistae''' ([[Latin]] for "'''Modists'''"), also known as the '''speculative grammarians''', were the members of a school of [[grammar]]ian philosophy known as '''Modism''' or '''speculative grammar''', active in northern [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Their influence was felt much less in the southern part of Europe, where the somewhat opposing tradition of the so-called "pedagogical grammar" never lost its preponderance. 
{{TOC limit|2}}

==History&lt;!--'Ralph of Beauvais', 'Speculative grammarians', and 'Thomas of Erfurt' redirect here--&gt;==
[[William of Conches]], [[Peter Helias]], and '''Ralph of Beauvais'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also referred to as '''speculative grammarians'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; predate the Modist movement proper.

The Modist philosophy was first developed by [[Martin of Dacia]] (died 1304)  and his colleagues in the mid-13th century, though it would rise to prominence only after its systematization by '''Thomas of Erfurt'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; decades later, in his treatise ''De modis significandi seu grammatica speculativa'', probably written in the first decade of the 14th century. Until the early twentieth-century this work was assumed to have been authored by [[John Duns Scotus]]. Widely reproduced and commented upon in the [[Middle Ages]], it remains the most complete textbook of Modist speculative grammar. The mistaken authorship arose out of the natural affinity of Erfurt's speculative grammar with Scotus's metaphysics.

==Theory of modes==
The philosophy of the Modistae, as indicated by their name, was based on a theory of 'modes' of meaning in language which was tripartite: modes of being (''modi essendi''), modes of understanding (''modi intelligendi''), and modes of signifying (''modi significandi''). To the Modistae, the various [[parts of speech]] were viewed as representing [[reality]] in terms of these modes. The ''modi essendi'' are objectively existent qualities in an object of understanding, the ''modi intelligendi'' the understanding's means of representing the ''modi essendi'', and the ''modi significandi'' grammar's means of representing the ''modi intelligendi'' in language. This corresponds to Aristotle's tripartite semantic theory of ''words'' representing ''concepts'' which represent ''objects''.

Opposing [[nominalism]], they assumed  that the analysis of the [[grammar]] of ordinary language was the key to [[metaphysics]]. For the Modistae, grammatical forms, the ''modi significandi'' of  verbs, nouns, and adjectives, comprise the deep [[ontological]] structure of language, which objectively reflects reality. Their work predicted the concept of [[universal grammar]], suggesting that universal grammatical rules may be extracted from all living languages. [[Roger Bacon]] may have given the movement inspiration with his observation that all languages are built upon a common grammar, a shared foundation of ontologically anchored linguistic structures. He argued grammar is substantially the same in all languages, even though it may undergo accidental variations between languages.

==Influences==
There are parallels between speculative grammar and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a fact that was picked up early on by [[Martin Heidegger]], who wrote his first book, ''Die Kategorien-und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'', on Thomas of Erfurt's treatise (at that time still mistakenly attributed to Duns Scotus).

The '''Monument to the Negev Brigade''' ({{lang-he|אנדרטת חטיבת הנגב}}, ''Andartat Hativat HaNegev''), known locally as the '''Andarta''', is a monument designed by [[Dani Karavan]] in memory of the members of the [[Palmach]] [[Negev Brigade]] who fell fighting on [[Israel]]'s side during the [[1948 Arab Israeli War]]. It is situated on a hill overlooking the city of [[Beersheba]] from the east and constitutes a recognized symbol of the [[Negev]] and Beersheba. In addition to its strengths as a memorial, it was a precursor to the [[land art]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Honnef, Manfred Schneckenburger, Christiane Fricke, and Karl Ruhrberg. ''ART of the 20th Century.'' Taschen. 2000. Pg. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was built between 1963 and 1968 at a time when Israel was making many physical memorials to those who fought and died in its wars.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/Culture/CULTURE-+Visual+Arts.htm ''CULTURE: Visual Arts.''] 1 Oct 2006 - accessed on 5 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of raw concrete consisting of eighteen separate elements covering 10,000 square meters. These elements are symbolic and connected to Palmach and to the War of Independence.

The perforated tower alludes to a watchtower shelled with gunfire and the pipeline tunnel is reminiscent of the channel of water in the Negev defended by the soldiers. Engraved in the concrete are the names of the 324 soldiers who died in the war,&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Defense.

My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!"&lt;/ref&gt;)  and songs.

'''''Mortality''''' is a 2012, posthumously published book by Anglo-American writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], comprising seven essays which first appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' concerning his struggle with oesophageal cancer, with which he was diagnosed during his 2010 book tour&lt;ref&gt;Bowcott, Owen (1 July 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/01/aurtho-christopher-hitchens-diagnosed-cancer "Author Christopher Hitchens diagnosed with cancer"] from ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and which killed him in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; An eighth chapter consisting of unfinished "fragmentary jottings," a foreword by [[Graydon Carter]], Hitchens' ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' editor and an afterword by Carol Blue, Hitchens' widow, are also included in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Hitchens held the post of contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' from November 1992 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]] contributor page at [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']]: http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/christopher-hitchens&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he contributed about 10 essays per year on subjects as diverse as politics and the limits of self-improvement, writing about "anything except sports".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd., p.103 {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he felt obliged when he was asked to write about his illness for the magazine, and managed to dispatch seven essays from "Tumourville" before he was overcome by his illness on 15 December 2011, aged 62.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The essays take as their subject matter his fear of losing the ability to write, the torture of chemotherapy, an analysis of [[Nietzsche]]'s proclamation that "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger," the joy of conversation and the very meaning of life.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The critical response to ''Mortality'' was largely positive with friends and admirers of Hitchens praising both his character in confronting his death and the way that this was transferred onto the page. In a glowing review of ''Mortality'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] described Hitchens' seven essays as "diamond-hard and brilliant" and "word-perfect." He wrote that it was "sobering and grief-inducing to read this brave and harrowing account of his "year of living dyingly" in the grip of the alien that succeeded where none of his debate opponents had in bringing him down." Buckley was a friend of Hitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colm Tóibín]] fondly wrote in ''[[The Guardian]] ''of his experiences with Hitchens, opining that "he was the best company in the world" and offered praise for ''Mortality'', writing that "in this book he does everything to make sure that his voice remains civilised, searching and ready to vanquish all his enemies, most notably in this case the dullness of death and its silence."&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín, Colm (31 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"]'' ''in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Observer]] ''[[Alexander Linklater]] was also complimentary. Referring to [[John N. Gray|John Gray's]] description of Hitchens as "one of the greatest living writers of English prose",&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (6 October 2011) [http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/09/hitchens-trotsky-convictions "Review: ''Arguably'' by Christopher Hitchens"]'' ''in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Linklater responded that "the only word of that which is certainly untrue is that Hitchens is now no longer living." He also noted: "The real struggle in ''Mortality'' is not with mortality. Hitchens cleaves to the logical conclusion of his materialism. He hints, rather, at a fear of losing himself, of becoming an imbecile, someone who might, in terror and pain, say something foolish or (God forbid) religious near the end, to give his enemies satisfaction. The true struggle of his last writings is to remain himself, deep in the country of the ill, for as long as he can."&lt;ref&gt;Linklater, Alexander (26 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/26/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another positive review came from the magazine where Hitchens started his career, ''The New Statesman''. George Eaton wrote that Hitchens' final work had "a timeless, aphoristic quality".&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, George (7 September 2012) [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/09/mortality-christopher-hitchens-–-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">'''Nuclear art''' was an artistic tendency developed  by some artists and painters, after the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |first=Maria  |last=Grandinetti
  |title=Punti programmatici del Movimento Eaista
  |journal= Arte Contemporanea  |location=[[Rome|Roma]]
  |year=1949 
  |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/maria-grandinetti_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ 
  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G. Pomodoro, Restany, Saura, Sordini, Vandercam ,Verga, Manifesto contro lo stile, Milano, 1959, link read in April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

'''Oblique projection''' is a simple type of technical drawing of [[graphical projection]] used for producing two-dimensional [[image]]s of three-dimensional objects. The objects are not in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], so they do not correspond to any view of an object that can be obtained in practice, but the technique does yield somewhat convincing and useful images.

Oblique projection is commonly used in technical drawing. The cavalier projection was used by French military artists in the 18th century to depict fortifications. Oblique projection was used almost universally by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries to the 18th century, especially when depicting rectilinear objects such as houses.&lt;ref name=Cucker299&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[File:Oblique projection comparison.svg|thumb|right|Comparison of an oblique projection (at left) and an orthographic projection (at right) of a unit cube (colored blue). The [[foreshortening]] factor (1/2 in this example) is inversely proportional to the [[tangent]] of the angle (63.43&amp;deg; in this example) between the [[projection plane]] (colored brown) and the projection lines (dotted).]]
Oblique projection is a type of [[parallel projection]]:
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plane).
In both oblique projection and [[orthographic projection]], parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image. The projectors in oblique projection intersect the projection plane at an oblique angle to produce the projected image, as opposed to the perpendicular angle used in orthographic projection.

Mathematically, the parallel projection of the point &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; on the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane gives &lt;math&gt;(x+az, y+bz, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; uniquely specify a parallel projection. When &lt;math&gt;a = b = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the projection is said to be "orthographic" or "orthogonal". Otherwise, it is "oblique". The constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are not necessarily less than 1, and as a consequence lengths measured on an oblique projection may be either larger or shorter than they were in space. In a general oblique projection, spheres of the space are projected as ellipses on the drawing plane, and not as circles as you would expect them from an orthogonal projection.

Oblique drawing is also the crudest "3D" drawing method but the easiest to master. One way to draw using an oblique view is to draw the side of the object you are looking at in two dimensions, i.e. flat, and then draw the other sides at an angle of 45°, but instead of drawing the sides full size they are only drawn with half the depth creating 'forced depth' – adding an element of realism to the object. Even with this 'forced depth', oblique drawings look very unconvincing to the eye. For this reason oblique is rarely used by professional designers or engineers.

==Oblique pictorial==
In an ''[[oblique pictorial]]'' drawing, the angles displayed among the axis, as well as the [[foreshortening]] factors (scale) are arbitrary.
More precisely, any given set of three coplanar segments originating from the same point may be construed as forming some oblique perspective of three sides of a cube. This result is known as [[Pohlke's theorem]], from the German mathematician Pohlke, who published it in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PohlkesTheorem.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Pohlke's Theorem". From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The resulting distortions make the [[wikt:technique|technique]] unsuitable for formal, working drawings. Nevertheless, the distortions are partially overcome by aligning one plane of the image parallel to the plane of projection. Doing so creates a true shape image of the chosen plane. 
This specific category of oblique projections, whereby lengths along the directions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are preserved, but lengths along direction &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are drawn at angle using a reduction factor is very much in use for industrial drawings.
* ''Cavalier projection'' is the name of such a projection, where the length along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis remains unscaled.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/~csjudy/planeview3D/tutorial-parallel.html Parallel Projections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423160654/http://www.mtsu.edu/~csjudy/planeview3D/tutorial-parallel.html |date=23 April 2007 }} from ''PlaneView3D Online''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cabinet projection'', popular in furniture illustrations, is an example of such a technique, wherein the receding axis is scaled to half-size&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; (sometimes instead two thirds the original).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Basic Engineering|series=Butterworth-Heinemann GNVQ Engineering Series|first=William|last=Bolton|publisher=BH Newnes|year=1995|isbn=9780750625845|page=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavalier projection==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

In '''cavalier projection''' (sometimes '''cavalier perspective''' or '''high view point''') a point of the object is represented by three coordinates, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, ''x″'' and ''y″''. On the flat drawing, two axes, ''x'' and ''z'' on the figure, are [[perpendicular]] and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the [[dimetric projection]]s, although it is not an [[axonometric projection]], as the third axis, here ''y'', is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the ''x″'' axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com:80/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822152816/http://www.tpub.com:80/ |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}/content/draftsman/14276/css/14276_307.htm Illustrator Draftsman 3 &amp; 2 – Volume 2 Standard Practices and Theory, page 67] from {{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com:80/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822152816/http://www.tpub.com:80/ |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Carlbom, Joseph Paciorek, Planar Geometric Projections and Viewing Transformations, [[ACM Computing Surveys]], v.10 n.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;465–502, Dec. 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very easy to draw, especially with pen and paper. It is thus often used when a figure must be drawn by hand, e.g. on a black board (lesson, oral examination).

The representation was initially used for military [[fortification]]s. In French, the « cavalier » (literally ''rider, horseman'', see ''[[Cavalry]]'') is an artificial hill behind the walls that allows to see the enemy above the walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trucsmaths.free.fr/etymologie.htm#C Etymologie des maths, letter C] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalier perspective was the way the things were seen from this high point. Some also explain the name by the fact that it was the way a rider could see a small object on the ground from his horseback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapage.noos.fr/r.ferreol/langage/notations/notations.htm DES QUESTIONS D’ORIGINES] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet projection==
The term '''cabinet projection''' (sometimes '''cabinet perspective''') stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Design Drawing|first1=Francis D. K.|last1=Ching|first2=Steven P.|last2=Juroszek|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118007372|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7TJYHdhgw8C&amp;pg=PA205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically 63.4°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.

=== Mathematical formula ===
As a formula, if the plane facing the viewer is ''xy'', and the receding axis is ''z'', then a point ''P'' is projected like this:
:&lt;math&gt; P \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
x + \frac12 z \cos \alpha \\ y + \frac12 z \sin \alpha \\  0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the mentioned angle.

The [[transformation matrix]] is:
: &lt;math&gt; P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac12 \cos \alpha \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac12 \sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively you could remove one third from the leading arm projected off the starting face, thus giving the same result.

==Military projection==
In the ''military projection'', the angles of the ''x''- and ''z''-axes are at 45°, meaning that the angle between the ''x''-axis and the ''z''-axis is 90°. That is, the ''xz''-plane is not skewed. It is rotated over 45°, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.compuphase.com/axometr.htm | title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer | accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Besides technical drawing and illustrations, [[video game]]s (especially those preceding the advent of 3D games) also often use a form of oblique projection. Examples include ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'', ''[[Ultima VII]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' and, more recently, ''[[Tibia (video game)|Tibia]]''.

The '''Rental Car Rally''' is a 36-hour city-to-city road rally that takes place &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Your Very Own Cannonball Run
|publisher=Jaunted.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads several times a year in different cities, with a different route each time. Founded in 2008 by the organizers of Wiimbledon and Street Wars, RCR sees an annual entry of about 30 cars per rally, with each team required to compete in a themed costume of their choosing, so long as the costume includes their vehicle. The rally is not a serious race in the traditional sense of competitive rally driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Great Debate: Gumball 3000 vs. Rental Car Rally
|publisher=Complex.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though teams win by merit of their costumes and low mileage. Organizers emphasize that Rental Car Rally is a road trip and not a race.

==History==
Drawing inspiration from the ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'' films, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'' cartoons as well as the [[Gumball 3000]], the Rental Car Rally was born as a more reasonable alternative to for those wanting to participate in a rally but who may not have the time and money required to complete in events such as the Bullrun and the Gumball 3000.

The first Rental Car Rally took place on August 15–17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=New York to Montreal overnight--with no GPS?
|publisher=CNET.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route required that participants drive from New York to Montreal, attend a party and drive back to NYC.

==Rally==

===2008 NYC to Montreal===
The inaugural rally featured 74 cars and 189 participants, and traveled from Long Island City, Queens to Montreal, Canada. Drivers were required to stop at 5 checkpoints along the route (which necessitated that mostly local roads were used) and collect evidence of their passing through them. 3 cars never made it to Montreal due to mechanical problems and 1 team - Jake's Clown Car - did not make it back from Montreal due to an accident in which no one was injured. The winner drove a van converted to resemble an emergency blood delivery vehicle.

'''Robert Penn Warren''' (April 24, 1905 – September 15, 1989) was an American poet, [[novelist]], and literary critic and was one of the founders of [[New Criticism]]. He was also a charter member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. He founded the literary journal ''[[The Southern Review]]'' with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1935. He received the 1947 [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel]] for his novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946) and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1958 and 1979. He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 27. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Warren was born in [[Guthrie, Kentucky]], very near the [[Tennessee]]-[[Kentucky]] border, to Robert Warren and Anna Penn.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 291. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's mother's family had roots in Virginia, having given their name to the community of Penn's Store in [[Patrick County, Virginia]], and was a descendant of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel [[Abram Penn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm Patrick County People, Free State of Patrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040008/http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Penn Warren graduated from Clarksville High School in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']], [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1925 and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (M.A.) in 1926. Warren pursued further graduate study at [[Yale University]] from 1927 to 1928 and obtained his [[B.Litt.]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from [[New College, Oxford]], in England in 1930. He also received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study in Italy during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now [[Rhodes College]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RobertPennWarren.png|thumb|Robert Penn Warren commemorative stamp|{{FFDC|1=RobertPennWarren.png|log=2009 June 10|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
While still an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, Warren became associated with the group of poets there known as the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], and somewhat later, during the early 1930s, Warren and some of the same writers formed a group known as the [[Southern Agrarians]]. He contributed "The Briar Patch" to the [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''[[I'll Take My Stand]]'' along with 11 other Southern writers and poets (including fellow Vanderbilt poet/critics [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]]). In "The Briar Patch" the young Warren defends racial segregation, in line with  the political leanings of the Agrarian group, although Davidson deemed Warren's stances in the essay so progressive that he argued for excluding it from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Edwin Thomas. "On Native Soil: A Visit with Robert Penn Warren," ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 38 (Winter 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Warren recanted these views in an article on the [[civil rights movement]], "Divided South Searches Its Soul", which appeared in the July 9, 1956 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. A month later, Warren published an expanded version of the article as a small book titled ''Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South''.&lt;ref&gt;Metress, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3549/is_n1_v32/ai_n28666757/ "Fighting battles one by one: Robert Penn Warren's ''Segregation''"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Southern Review'', Winter 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently adopted a high profile as a supporter of [[racial integration]]. In 1965, he published ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', a collection of interviews with black civil rights leaders including [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King]], thus further distinguishing his political leanings from the more conservative philosophies associated with fellow Agrarians such as Tate, [[Cleanth Brooks]], and particularly Davidson. Warren's interviews with civil rights leaders are at the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uky.edu/libraries/nunncenter Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren's best-known work is ''[[All the King's Men]]'', a novel that won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947. Main character [[Willie Stark (character)|Willie Stark]] resembles [[Huey Pierce Long]] (1893–1935), the radical [[Populism|populist]] governor of [[Louisiana]] whom Warren was able to observe closely while teaching at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] from 1933 to 1942. ''All the King's Men'' became a highly successful film, starring [[Broderick Crawford]] and winning the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1949. A 2006 film adaptation by writer/director [[Steven Zaillian]] featured [[Sean Penn]] as Willie Stark and [[Jude Law]] as Jack Burden. The opera ''[[Willie Stark]]'' by [[Carlisle Floyd]] to his own libretto based on the novel was first performed in 1981.

Warren served as the [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], 1944–1945 (later termed [[Poet Laureate]]), and won two Pulitzer Prizes in poetry, in 1958 for ''Promises: Poems 1954–1956'' and in 1979 for ''Now and Then''. ''Promises'' also won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]].&lt;ref name=nba1958&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;(With essay by Kiki Petrosino from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog, and other material on Warren.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected him for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Warren's lecture was entitled "Poetry and Democracy" (subsequently published under the title ''Democracy and Poetry'').&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lectures].

Harvard University Press. Retrieved September 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977, Warren was awarded the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the St. Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Warren was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. In 1981, Warren was selected as a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and later was named as the first U.S. [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] on February 26, 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#87 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren was co-author, with [[Cleanth Brooks]], of ''[[Understanding Poetry]]'', an influential literature textbook. It was followed by other similarly co-authored textbooks, including  ''Understanding Fiction'', which was praised by [[Southern Gothic]] and Roman Catholic writer [[Flannery O'Connor]], and ''Modern Rhetoric'', which adopted what can be called a [[New Critical]] perspective.

==Personal life==
His first marriage was to Emma Brescia. His second marriage was in 1952 to [[Eleanor Clark]], with whom he had two children, [[Rosanna Warren|Rosanna Phelps Warren]] (born 1953) and Gabriel Penn Warren (born 1955). During his tenure at Louisiana State University he resided at Twin Oaks (otherwise known as the [[Robert Penn Warren House]]) in Prairieville, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019140957/http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived the latter part of his life in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]], and [[Stratton, Vermont]] where he died of complications from prostate cancer. He is buried at Stratton, Vermont, and, at his request, a memorial marker is situated in the Warren family gravesite in Guthrie, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
In April 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Warren's birth. Introduced at the post office in his native Guthrie, it depicts the author as he appeared in a 1948 photograph, with a background scene of a political rally designed to evoke the setting of ''All the King's Men''. His son and daughter, Gabriel and [[Rosanna Warren]], were in attendance.

Vanderbilt University houses the [[Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]], which is sponsored by the College of Arts and Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/ Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; It began its programs in January 1988, and in 1989 received a $480,000 Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The center promotes "interdisciplinary research and study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences."

The high school that Robert Penn Warren attended, Clarksville High School (Tennessee), was renovated into an apartment complex in 1982. The original name of the apartments was changed to The Penn Warren in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Penn Warren - History|url=http://thepennwarren.com/history/|website=ThePennWarren.com|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre''' ({{lang-sl|Gledališče sester Scipion Nasice}}) was founded on October 13, 1983, with a founding manifesto (The Sister Letter). The manifesto set this theatre group a time frame of operation – four years – and described its stages from formation to self-destruction. The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (1983-1987) constituted – along with [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and [[IRWIN]] groups – one of the three pillars of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] retrogarde movement. Within the retrogarde movement, theatre research engaged in the relation between religion, art and state. It focused on rituals and the function of spectacle in theatre and in the function of spectacle the state.

The founders of the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were [[Eda Čufer]], [[Dragan Živadinov]] and [[Miran Mohar]].

The retrogarde production of events, as it was announced in the manifesto (The Sister Letter), incorporated an external manifestative part (actions) and an internal creative part (operations):
- external part: The Appearance (1983), The Resurrection (1984) and The Self-Destruction (1987)
- internal part: three stages of transformation - The Illegality (1984), The Exorcism (1985) and The Retro-Classic (1986)

In 1987, the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre performed self-destruction.

'''''Seeker After Truth: A Handbook''''' was written by [[Idries Shah]], one of the foremost writers on [[Sufism]].  It was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1982.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Seeker After Truth'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content==
The book is constructed from a mix of classical teaching tales, letters, question and answer sessions, anecdotes and discussions from dinner meetings.  As such it is part of the large corpus of material that Idries Shah disseminated over a 40 year period specifically for people who wished to absorb Sufi patterns of thought and behaviour in the way that he suggested was appropriate and effective for modern times. He described the process in this book in answer to the question, “What is the reason for the way in which your materials are projected in print? I mean, why do you translate some material, represent other portions, use Eastern similes in some and Western psychological terminology and insights in others?”
[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|160px|[[Idries Shah]]]]
He replied, “There are two criteria:

(1) What materials have to be projected at the present time to have the maximum useful effect, and

(2) Who can absorb them and in what format?

“Sufic materials are always presented in accordance with the possibilities. This is because Sufism is not archaeology or hagiography (however much it may resemble them to those who look no further) but effect. Eastern similes that are still viable both in the East and West are used because of this viability. Superseded materials are not regurgitated just because they have been used in former times. Materials are re-presented if this can be usefully done. 'Western' psychological terminology and insights are useful, so they are used.

“Look at the results. The published materials are read and accepted in both the East and West; by scientists as well as theologians, by ordinary readers in addition to specialists of all kinds. In a word, the presentation is effective.
 
“If there were no originating impulse from which the material comes and which indicates how it may be used, we would be forced to present Sufi materials like you would any other dead corpus of lore: you would rearrange, prune and present in accordance with subjective assessments. We do not have to do this, since the material itself provides the guidance to those who can descry it. The question, however, illustrates the mind of the questioner more than anything else; for it presupposes that Sufi materials are like those of any other pursuit, capable of being manipulated by rule or whim. Had the questioner taken into consideration the Sufi fact that the Teaching determines its method of presentation, he would not have needed to ask the question.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1982) Seeker After Truth: A Handbook. London. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-900860-91-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[The Literary Review]] wrote that ''Seeker After Truth'' was, “food for many different kinds of study - a book unlike anything our own society has produced until recently, in its richness, its unexpectedness, its capacity to shock us into seeing ourselves as others see us, both personally and as a society.”

Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, in their book ''New World New Mind'', recommend ''Seeker After Truth'' and other books by Idries Shah "...for the beginnings of a short course on changing your mind." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Shirvanshah's palace mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahlar sarayı türbəsi}}) or '''tomb of Shirvanshahs’ family''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahların ailə türbəsi}}) is a historical monument of the XV century. Locating in [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]], it is a part of [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Palace of the Shirvanshahs complex]]. The mausoleum is one of the three buildings located in courtyard of the complex, the others being [[Palatial mosque in Baku|Shirvanshah's palace mosque]] and [[Shirvanshahs' bath houses|Shirvanshah's palace bath house]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= Şirvаnşаhlаr türbəsi|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,19/lang,az/#monument2|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Palacio de los Shirvanshah, Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-28, DD 26.jpg|thumb|270px|left|&lt;center&gt;Tombs inside of the mausoleum&lt;/center&gt;]]
The inscription on the entrance gives information about the history and architecture of the building. It says: ''“The defender of the religion, the man of the prophet, the great Sultan, [[Khalilullah I|Shirvanshah Khalilullah]], God save his kingdom and reign, he ordered this magnificent tomb for his mother and his seven-year-old son, May Allah have mercy on them, he ordered to build in 839."''&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

In 1954, [[oriental studies|orientalist]] A.A. Alesgerzade read these writings on the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; The other writings are taken from the Koran. On [[Medallion (architecture)|medallion]], which decorates the portal, there's an inscription, which can be only red with a mirror. It indicates the architect of the monument: ''“Allah, architect Muhammad Ali”''. As it is forbidden for architects to write their names on buildings, they encoded their name with this method.''&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

The use of the mausoleum later as a [[madrasa]] resulted worsening condition of the graves.&lt;ref name="Dadashov21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the archeological excavations carried out in 1947, six tombs were discovered deeper than the floor surface.&lt;ref name="Dadashov21"/&gt;

}}
According to the inscriptions on the entrance, it is clear that the mausoleum was built for the mother and son of [[Khalilullah I|Shirvanshah Khalilullah]]. Nevertheless, there were buried other members of the Shirvanshahs’ family. Stone plaques were discovered under the dismantled floor during the excavations. These plaques were used to cover 7 graves. Only in five graves bone remains were found, although the other two were empty.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

The historian [[Muhammad Khwandamir|Khwandamir]] of XV century wrote in his work, [[Habib al-Siyar]] that [[Ismail I]], the ruler of [[Safavids]] promised to burn bones of Shirvanshahs family to ash as an insult and to take vengeance of his father and grandfather. During capture of [[Baku]] by Safavids in 1501, two graves were opened and the bones inside were removed. The other five graves weren't touched.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

In praises, [[qasida]]s, [[ghazal]]s of the palace poet of Shirvanshahs, [[Badr Shirvani]], the persons buried in the tombs were distinguished and specified. He was one of the most famous poets of [[Shirvan]] in late 14th-early 15th centuries. In his collection of works, Badr indicated names and birth dates of the persons who were buried in the mausoleum.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

In the first tomb the son of Shirvanshah Farrukh Yamin of 6–7 years old, was buried.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; There remains hair on the skull and chest of the corpse. During cleaning of the bones remnants of the shroud were determined. According one of the praises, the son of the Shirvanshah (1435–1442) died at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

Thinness of the teeth and the bones are the indicators that the second grave belongs to an old woman. In one of the praises, the name of the mother of the Shirvanshah were shown as Bika and it was noted that she was an influential woman who died in 1435–1436 ([[Hijri]] 839).&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

In the third grave Khanika khanim, wife of [[Shahrukh of Shirvan|Shirvanshah Shahrukh]] was buried.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; Badr Shirvani used to note her name in his works.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Salah, two years old son of the Shirvanshah was buried in the fourth tomb.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; He lived in 1443–1445 (Hijri 847–849). Inside the grave, glazed ceramics and candelabrum parts.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

The fifth tomb belongs to Ibrahim II (1432), who died at the age of 19.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; Silk remnants, blue beads, and a golden pin with a needle with length of 36 cm were found in the grave. On the pin there was a turquoise and six sapphire gems.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

On the opposite side of the entrance a large skeleton with a height of 2.10 meters was discoreved. It is that is the grave of [[Khalilullah I]]. A comb and a gold earring was found in the site.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
===General planning and construction===
[[File:Усыпальница матери и сына Хана в разрезе.jpg|230px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Cross-section of the monument&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:План усыпальницы матери и сына Хана.jpg|180px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Plan of the mausoleum&lt;/center&gt;]]
The only entrance to the tomb is the portal on the main facade. On the right and left sides of the corridor there are two small rooms. A door is opened to the corridor from each of these rooms. It is supposed that these rooms used to belong to religious figures. Visitors enters the main hall – the crypt from the corridor. The hall is cruciform in the plan. The middle part of it is covered with a stone [[dome]]. The dome is fixed to the roof and stone walls.&lt;ref name="Dadashov20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side of the door, between the branches of the cross there are two small rooms inside the thick stone walls. It is supposed to be used as a cell or warehouse where the tomb items were stored.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external side of the dome covering upper part of the middle of the hall were decorated with glazed tiles. However, those tiles do not currently exist.&lt;ref name="Dadashov20"/&gt;

On the upper part of [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] ornament on the [[stalactite]] dome there is a zone consisting of inscriptions with religious characters, and on the tympanums there are medallions on both sides, which is written internally. To reduce differences with other surrounding ornaments, the letters of the writings were specially scaled and styled. The inscription on the entrance door of the portal shows that the mausoleum was built by Shirvanshah Khalilullah I for his mother and son in Hijri 839 (1435–1436).

Tectonics of architectural volumes dominate the interior. Here appears artistic style of architectural techniques that was implemented by architect Ali.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration of the portal and facade===
The portal repeats composition of Divankhane, which is a part of [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Palace of the Shirvanshahs complex]] but in comparison, it is simply solved. The stalactite dome consists of four stalactites, the side walls are smooth, only tympanums of the arches on the entrance door are with ornaments, and on its upper parts two lines of inscriptions are etched.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"/&gt;

An hexagonal figure is included in ornaments of the tympanums on the entrance door. Inside of them, the word "Ali" is repeated six times vividly.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; The portal is about half a meter from the wall. In front of this ledge there is a pavement which plays the role of a bench for people, extending all over the main facade and which is inside the portal. This structure is characteristic for the most of the buildings constructed during that era.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"/&gt;

On the top part of the portal, 92th [[ayah]] of XII [[surah]] of Koran is etched with method of carving: ''“Allah, the greatest, said: "Today Allah will forgive you, for he is the most merciful of all.”'' &lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique''' ('''SACEM''') is a [[France|French]] [[professional association]] collecting payments of artists’ rights and distributing the [[copyright|right]]s to the original [[songwriter]]s, [[composer]]s, and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s.

==History==
Composers [[Ernest Bourget]], [[Victor Parizot]] and [[Paul Henrion]] in Paris in 1847 (see [[1847 in music]]) succeeded in having payment made for their works which were being played in the leading café-concert at the time, [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]]. The French courts recognized these legitimate rights founded in revolutionary laws. The provisional union of authors, composers and publishers of music was thus established in 1850, and one year later, the professional union became a society (société civile) of authors, composers, and publishers who divided the author’s rights collected amongst the members, and this rule has been maintained to the present day.

The '''talus''' is an architectural feature of some [[late medieval]] [[castles]], especially prevalent in [[Crusades|crusader]] constructions. It consists of a [[Batter (walls)|battered]] (sloping) face at the base of a [[Fortification|fortified wall]]. The slope acts as an effective defensive measure in two ways. First, conventional siege equipment is less effective against a wall with a talus. [[Escalade|Scaling ladders]] may be unable to reach the top of the walls and are also more easily broken due to the bending stresses caused by the angle they are forced to adopt. [[Siege towers]] cannot approach closer than the base of the talus, and their [[Corvus (weapon)|gangplank]] may be unable to cover the horizontal span of the talus, rendering them useless. Furthermore, defenders are able to drop rocks over the walls, which will shatter on the talus, spraying a hail of [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] into any attackers massed at the base of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Textbook.JPG|thumb|Textbook]]
A '''textbook''' or '''coursebook''' ([[British English|UK English]]) is a manual of instruction in any branch of study. Textbooks are produced according to the demands of educational institutions. '''Schoolbooks''' are textbooks and other books used in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|schoolbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|title=schoolbook - definition of schoolbook in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818041404/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, most textbooks aren't published exclusively in printed format; many are now available as online [[e-book|electronic books]].

==History==
The history of textbooks dates back to civilizations of ancient history. For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote ''texts'' intended for education. The modern textbook has its roots in the standardization made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers, who used the books as instructional aids (e.g., alphabet books), as well as individuals who taught themselves.

The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) &lt;ref&gt;Marcia Clemmitt, "Learning Online Literacy," in "Reading Crisis?" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next revolution for books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.

Gutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s — a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]], copies of which can be viewed on the British Library website. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, "Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible," http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compulsory education]] and the subsequent growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many standardized texts for children. Textbooks have become the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].

Technological advances change the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic and PDF books, online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an electronically published book, or e-book, is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].

Most notably, an increasing number of authors are foregoing commercial publishers and offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.

==Market==

===The "broken market"===
The textbook market does not operate in the same manner as most consumer markets.  First, the end consumers (students) do not select the product, and the people (faculty and professors) who do select the product do not purchase it.  Therefore, price is removed from the purchasing decision, giving the producer (publishers) disproportionate market power to set prices high.  However, some{{who|date=November 2017}} argue that textbooks are really part of another product; the class that the student registered to take.  But the price of the textbook still isn't typically taken into account when this occurs and isn't part of the perception of the product.  

This fundamental difference in the market is often cited as the primary reason that prices are high.  The term "broken market" first appeared in the economist James Koch's analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, James P. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 "An Economic Analysis of Textbook Prices and the Textbook Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622145100/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 |date=2012-06-22 }}, 2006-09. Retrieved on 2012-06-12. ([http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/CBICBT99/FIN_AID/US_ED/A060923K.pdf Alternative location (PDF)])&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is exacerbated by the lack of competition in the textbook market.  [[Consolidation (business)|Consolidation]] in the past few decades{{when|date=December 2011}} has reduced the number of major textbook companies from around 30 to just a handful.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Marla Matzer. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110523050151/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html City at the head of the class: Consolidation, talent pool have made Columbus a hotbed for educational publishers.] August 5, 2007. Retrieved 2/14/09. Archived from [http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html the original] on 23 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, there is less competition than there used to be, and the high cost of starting up keeps new companies from entering.

===New editions and the used book market===
Students seek relief from rising prices through the purchase of [[resale|used copies]] of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive.  Most college bookstores offer used copies of textbooks at lower prices.  Most bookstores will also buy used copies back from students at the end of a term if the book is going to be re-used at the school.  Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores where the books will be sold.  Textbook companies have countered this by encouraging faculty to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website.  If a student has a new textbook, then he or she can use the pass code in the book to register on the site.  If the student has purchased a used textbook, then he or she must pay money directly to the publisher in order to access the website and complete assigned homework.

Students who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices.  With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.

Most leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math &amp; science.  Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. "New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices," &lt;ref&gt;But, in fact, no revenue from used book sales flows either to the publisher or to the author of the work.  New editions serve to keep revenues flowing to publishers and authors, but do not affect prices paid for used older editions.

"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522288 Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517084733/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522288 |date=2008-05-17 }}." ''The Harvard Crimson,'' 4 March 2008. Retrieved on 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of previous edition, and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by faculty demand.  The Student PIRGs' study found that 76% of faculty said new editions were justified “half of the time or less” and 40% said they were justified “rarely” or “never.”&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 Rip-off 101: How the Current Practices of the Textbook Industry Drive Up the Cost of College Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211618/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 |date=2010-03-22 }} The Student PIRGs (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.&lt;ref&gt;Capriccioso, Rob. [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/29/textbooks Throwing Down the Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025709/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/29/textbooks |date=2008-10-29 }}. ''Inside Higher Ed'', August 29, 2006. Retrieved 2/14/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on electronic textbooks, or "eTextbooks," does not always save students money.  Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.&lt;ref name="course-correction"&gt;Allen, Nicole. [http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction Course Correction: How Digital Textbooks Are Off Track and How to Set Them Straight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211602/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction |date=2010-03-22 }}. The Student PIRGs (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bundling===
Another publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is "bundling," or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material.  Students do not always have the option to purchase these items separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.&lt;ref name="required-reading"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading Required Reading: A Look at the Words Publishing Tactics at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064817/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they “rarely” or “never” use the bundled items in their courses.&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"/&gt;

A 2005 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) Report found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers’ practice 
of packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;"[http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 College Textbooks: Enhanced Offerings Appear to Drive Recent Price Increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071824/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 |date=2008-06-19 }}." U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC, 2005. Abstract. Retrieved 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bundling has also been used as a means of segmenting the used book market.  Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN.  A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book.  When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.

Legislation on the state and federal level seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of "integrated textbooks."

===Price disclosure===
Given that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the "broken" economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|title=Textbook Battle's New Frontier|author=Elia Powers|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821104447/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.

No data suggests that this is in fact true.  However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain.  Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked.

===Used textbook market===
Once a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.

====Campus buyback====
As for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;

When students resell their textbooks during campus “buyback” periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.

====Student to student sales====
Students can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.

====Student online marketplaces====
Online marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.

====Online book buyers====
Online book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus "buyback" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer "free shipping" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.

====Textbook exchanges====
In response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.

According to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of "dealing with this problem", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L. Roediger, III|date=January 2005|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317041203/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction.  The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.

==== E-textbooks ====
Another alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks.The article "E books rewrite the rules of education" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been "gaining momentum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article " Are textbooks obsolete?", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. "The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says " As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

=== Rental programs ===
In-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.

=== Textbook sharing ===
Another method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.

=== Open textbooks ===
{{main|Open textbook}}
The latest trend in textbooks is "open textbooks." An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by its author(s).  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261   Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work.

The other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.

On the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

===International market pricing===

Similar to the issue of reimportation of [[pharmaceuticals]] into the U.S. market, the GAO report&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.

===Production===

====Cost distribution====
According to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
Bookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

====Research====
According to the GAO study published July 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Following closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.

Rising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period."''

According to the 2007 edition of the College Board’s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent."''

==K-12 textbooks==
In most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.

Textbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.

===High school===
In recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Science textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.

Discussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.

In his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent — for reasons of timing — a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.

== Mathematics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Largely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast "progressive" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to "devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.

==Higher education==
In the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.

In some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.

With higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices &lt;ref name=GAO /&gt; increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, “Turn the Page,” reported that the average U.S. student spends $700–$1000 per year on textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party—faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers—for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.

Textbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.

==Textbook bias on controversial topics==
In cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, "the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Inclusive education ==
Textbooks are an important aspect of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]] in how they incorporate inclusive language, diverse identities, and human rights, particularly as they reflect issues of culture, gender, and religion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|title=Making textbook content inclusive: A focus on religion, culture and gender|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100203-8|location=|pages=8–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421001802/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|archivedate=2017-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
The defense of [[cultural diversity]], as understood by [[UNESCO]], is an ethical imperative, inseparable from children’s universal [[right to education]]. It implies a commitment to the fundamental rights of persons belonging to minorities and to the [[cultural rights]] that are an integral part of [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27, and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 13 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is also central to contemporary debates on citizenship and identity, social cohesion, and the growth of knowledge- based economies. Education has a major part to play in shaping such dialogues as cultural exchanges and economic cooperation become increasingly more common. Textbooks can be used to promote cultural diversity and, in particular, nurture culture in its broadest sense understood as the “whole complex of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social group.”&lt;ref&gt;Mexico City Declaration on Cultural Policies, World Conference on Cultural Policies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Having concentrated on rooting out [[Racism|racist]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] prejudice in textbooks as early as 1946, in the 1970s UNESCO started to tackle [[gender stereotypes]], which are recognized as a source of enduring inequality between women and men. A research programme on the image of women was launched after the 1980 Copenhagen World Conference of the [[United Nations Decade for Women]] to identify and characterize sexism and recommend various steps to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andrée Michel (1986). Down with stereotypes! Eliminating sexism from children’s literature and school textbooks. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme showed that [[sexism]] in textbooks often consists of failing to recognize the range of actual roles played by men and women in society and neglecting the real advances that have been made in terms of gender equality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Textbooks should help students understand the roles most often assigned to women and men and recognize those aspects of social change needed to build a fairer social order that includes both sexes and [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] on an equal footing with the mainstream society. Discussions prompted by reading textbooks and teacher-pupil interactions can be used to address, question, and dismiss stereotypes. Relating examples from past societies and telling stories that give prominence to other gender categories (besides men and women) and other [[sexual orientation]]s (besides [[heterosexuality]]) can show the prejudicial effect of the division of humankind into two sexes and the imposition of heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
With the rise of [[globalization]], the multiplicity of world views and religious practices that individuals confront has increased. Textbooks are instrumental in the process of raising awareness about others’ beliefs and fostering understanding of, and respect for, the diversity of beliefs present in societies and the world at large. Textbooks can help to combat prejudice, present pluralism as an asset, and encourage mutual understandings based on respect for the right to express one’s beliefs. They contribute to promoting tolerance, critical thinking in the face of divisive stereotyping and discrimination, and the independence of individual choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Book of the Book''''' is a book by [[Idries Shah]]. The majority of the book's 200 pages are blank, with the remaining nine pages telling the story of a book left by a wise man consisting of one sentence and attempts over hundreds of years to discern the intended meaning. 

[[Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton]] writing for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' said, "I suppose his admirers among the Hampstead intelligentsia will have swallowed this buffoonery with the same enthusiasm with which they have gulped down the rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1970/10/22/the-mysterious-east-2/|title=The Mysterious East|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L. P.|last2=Lessing|first2=Doris|date=July 2, 1970|website=The New York Review of Books|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doris Lessing]] responded to Elwell-Sutton's remarks, in the ''New York Review of Books'', stating "Ignorance, I will admit, is no crime, and I am sure that Dr. Elwell-Sutton does not claim to be a literary man. But motivation has its mysteries." 

A review in [[Studies in Comparative Religion]] stated "The Book of the Book, which purports to be an object lesson in the problem of the container and the content, consists of some fifteen pages of print bound together with over 250 blank pages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The News Letter of the LXIVmos''''' was a near-monthly publication edited by book collector James D. Henderson (writing as "The Scrivener") that ran from 1927 to 1929.{{refn|name=Edison}}  The twenty-one issues focused on [[miniature books]], of which Henderson's collection was already considered to be "the finest ... in the world" when he displayed it at Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1933.{{refn|name=Crimson}} The name comes from the book trade and is read "[[Book size|sixty-four-mos]]", meaning a sheet of paper folded 64 times to form a book with pages of three inches or smaller.{{refn|name=Edison}}  Henderson regularly printed answers from his readers to the question "Why collect miniature books since they are too small to read?", with responses ranging from saving space, to pedagogy, to "Everyone should have a hobby."{{refn|name=Pascoe}}

The editions were printed in a number of different cities around the world, including a special issue{{refn | name=BlackSun}} published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Paris.{{refn|name=Minkoff}}  Robert Massmann and Ruth Adomeit published an index to the periodical in 1962.{{refn|name=Massmann}}  A [[facsimile]] edition of the complete run was issued in 1968.{{refn|name=facs}} LXIVmos inspired the creation of the later ''Miniature Book News''{{refn|name=Edison}} and is listed, along with several other works by Henderson, in the Miniature Book Society's ''Essential References for a Miniature Book Collector.''{{refn|name=MBS}}

'''''The Triumph of Death''''' is a fresco in the Regional Gallery of [[Palazzo Abatellis]] in [[Palermo]], southern [[Italy]]. It is considered one of the most representative works of the late [[Gothic painting]] in Italy. The author of the work, which is dated around 1446, is unknown.

==History==
The work comes from the court of Palazzo Sclafani, also in Palermo. Due to its highly refined style, it is thought to have been commissioned directly by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]] [[kingdom of Sicily|Kings of Naples]], probably to a Catalan or Provençal artist. The theme of the "Triumph of Death" was already widespread in Europe during the 14th century, but here is represented with a particular stress on macabre and grotesque themes characterized by a cruel appearance, all features rare in Italy. Names proposed for the author include [[Guillaume Spicre]] from [[Bourgogne]].

The fresco was stripped and divided into four parts to be housed in the Regional Gallery, where it is now located. Though at the time of the removal the work was in good condition, gradually during the 20th century the painted surface has detached near the points of division, compromising the integrity of the scene.

==Description==
The fresco is composed as a large miniature, where in a luxurious garden surrounded by a hedge, Death enters riding a skeletal horse, firing arrows from a bow. Death aims at characters belonging to all social levels, killing them. The horse occupies the centre of the scene, with its ribs visible and an emaciated head showing teeth and the tongue. Death has just released an arrow, which has hit a young man in the lower right corner; Death also wears scythe at the side of the saddle, its typical attribute.

On the lower part are corpses of the people previously killed: emperors, popes, bishops, friars (both [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]), poets, knights and maidens. Each character is portrayed differently: some still have a grimace of pain on the face, while others are serene; some have their limbs dismembered on the ground, and others are kneeling after having been just struck by an arrow. On the left is a group of poor people, invoking Death to stop their suffering, but being ignored. Among them, the figure looking towards the observer has been proposed as a possible self-portrait of the artist.

On the right is a group of the nobles, shown as having no interest in the events, most of them continuing their activities. They include several musicians, richly dressed noblewomen  and knights with fur clothes, as symbols of life and youth. A man has a hawk on his arm, and another is leading two hounds.

'''Tigran Melikov's House'''({{lang-az|Tiqran Məlikovun evi}}) is a historic mansion located at crossing of Islam Safarli and Hazi Aslanov streets in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan. The mansion was built between 1895 and 1897 on the order of Tigran Melikov, who was a son of [[Armenians|Armenian]] industrialist, Ambarsum Melikov. It is the first building built in the Gothic style in Baku,&lt;ref name="Fətullayev15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ensiklopediya201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bakının memarlıq ensiklopediyası|2013|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Józef Gosławski (architect)|Józef Gosławski]]'s first project on personal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Фатуллаев-Фигаров|first=Шамиль|title=Юзеф Гославский (1865 -1904)|url=http://www.polonia-baku.org/ru/goslawski.phtml|website=polonia-baku.org|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1813, while establishing the outer-city, the area was given the architectural look of a square, which is still preserved. The mansion was built at crossing of Islam Safarli and Hazi Aslanov streets. Melikov's mansion was the first building to be built in gothic style in Baku. While building the mansion, [[Adolf Eichler]] was preparing plan of a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] styled church in [[28 May Street]]. 

==Architectural features==
In terms of the difficulty of the residential building, the individual form of the project is formed in the context of the classical style of Baku. The facades are covered with stones. The mansion is full of windows which helps to enlighten it. The rooms in the south and east and the staircase are brightly lit by the lamp on the roof.&lt;ref name="Ensiklopediya200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bakının memarlıq ensiklopediyası|2013|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Profiled arches were used on the two upper floors of the building. On the third floor a balcony is opened on bay window fixed on second floor. Bay windows contains two main and two additional windows. The narrowest part of the residential property is located in the east. Shamil Fatullayev notes, Gosławski created facades under unfluence of Florencian palaces.&lt;ref name="Fətullayev16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wistman's Wood''' is one of only three remote high-altitude oakwoods on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. (The other two are Black Tor Beare on the [[West Okement]] at SX565892 and Piles Copse on the [[River Erme]] at SX644620.)

==Geography==
It lies at an altitude of 380–410 metres in the valley of the [[West Dart]] River near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]], &lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/654b7294-0f84-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0.html |title=Twisted oaks and tales on the trail of Devon's pygmy forest |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |newspaper=Financial Times |date=19 June 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at grid reference SX612774.

The source of the [[Devonport Leat]], at a weir on the West Dart River, is just north of the wood.

==Preservation status==
This is one of the highest oakwoods in Britain and, as an outstanding example of native upland oak woodland, was selected as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="sssi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001201|title=Natural England - SSSIs : SSSI information|publisher=www.english-nature.org.uk|accessdate=2008-10-13}} Choose "View citation" to access the citation (pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[A Nature Conservation Review|NCR site]] and forms part of the Wistman’s Wood [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]]. The wood was also one of the primary reasons for selection of the Dartmoor [[Special Area of Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dartmoor SAC web page http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The wood is split into three main blocks (North, Middle and South Groves or Woods), which in total cover about 3.5 ha (9 acres).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; These occupy sheltered, south-west facing slopes, where a bank of large granite boulders ("clitter") is exposed, and pockets of acid, free-draining, brown earth soils have accumulated. It is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; and has been managed since 1961 under a nature reserve agreement with the [[Nature Conservancy Council]], [[English Nature]] and [[Natural England]]. There is no active management, but many people visit the site on foot (mostly accessing the southern end of South Wood), and cattle and sheep have free access where the terrain permits, outside of a small fenced exclosure in South Wood.

===Flora===
The vegetation conforms mostly to W17a ''Quercus petraea-Betula pubescens-Dicranum majus'' woodland, ''Isothecium myosuroides-Diplophyllum albicans'' sub-community in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]]. The trees are mainly [[pedunculate oak]], with occasional [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], and a very few [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], and [[Salix aurita|eared-willow]]. Tree branches are characteristically festooned with a variety of [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] mosses and lichens and, sometimes, by grazing-sensitive species such as [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]] and [[Polypodium vulgare|polypody]]. On the ground, boulders are usually covered by lichens and mossy patches – frequent species include ''Dicranum scoparium'', ''Hypotrachyna laevigata'', ''Rhytidiadelphus loreus'' and ''Sphaerophorus globosus'' – and, where soil has accumulated, patches of acid grassland grow with [[Galium saxatile|heath bedstraw]], [[Potentilla erecta|tormentil]] and [[Rumex acetosa|sorrel]]. In places protected from livestock, grazing-sensitive plants such as [[Oxalis acetosella|wood sorrel]], [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]], [[Luzula sylvatica|wood rush]] and [[Rubus fruticosus|bramble]] occur. A fringe of [[Pteridium aquilinum|bracken]] surrounds much of the wood, demarcating the extent of brown earth soils.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; The wood supports approximately 120 species of lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoare |first1=Ben |title=Wild Month |work=BBC Wildlife |date=November 2018 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The wood is home to a large population of [[Vipera berus|adders]].&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==History==
Wistman's Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely a left-over from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor c. 7000 BC, before [[Mesolithic]] hunter/gatherers cleared it around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; Photographic and other records show that Wistman's Wood has changed considerably since the mid-19th century; at the same time climatic conditions have also generally become warmer.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, M.C.F., Spooner, G.M. and Spooner, M. 1980. Changes in Wistman’s Wood, Devon: photographic and other evidence. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 112, Pages 43-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mountford"&gt;Mountford, E,P., Backmeroff, C.E. and Peterken, G.F. 2001. Long-term patterns of growth, mortality, regeneration and natural disturbance in Wistman’s Wood, a high altitude oakwood on Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 133, Pages 231-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have the older oak trees grown from a stunted/semi-prostrate to a more ascending form, but a new generation of mostly straight-grown and single-stemmed oaks has developed. The oldest oaks appear to be 400–500 years old, and originated within a degenerating oakwood that survived in scrub form during two centuries of cold climate.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; In c. 1620 these old trees were described as "no taller than a man may touch to top with his head". Tree height increased somewhat by the mid-19th century, and during the 20th century approximately doubled (in 1997 the maximum and average height of trees was around 12 m and 7 m respectively).&lt;ref name="Mountford"/&gt; In addition, a wave of marginal new oaks arose after c. 1900, roughly doubling the area of wood. Part of the evidence for these changes comes from a permanent vegetation plot located in the southern end of South Wood. This is the oldest known of its kind in British woodland, with a small part having been recorded by Hansford Worth in 1921.&lt;ref name="Christy"&gt;Christy, M. and Worth, R.H. 1922. The ancient dwarfed oak woods of Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 54, Pages 291-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Buller Stone'', a boulder to the east of the wood, commemorates an attempt in 1866 to date the trees, when Wentworth Buller (with permission from the Duchy) felled an oak. It was estimated to be 168 years old.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==Myths, art and literature==
The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth century accounts. One tradition holds that it was planted by [[Isabella de Forz, Countess of Devon|Isabella de Fortibus]] (1237-93).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; 

The wood is described in detail and discussed as a point of great interest in ''The Tree'', a 1978 essay on naturalism by English novelist [[John Fowles]].
