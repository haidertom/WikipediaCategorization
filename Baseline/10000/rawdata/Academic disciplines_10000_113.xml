{{italic title}}

'''''A capriccio''''' {{IPA-it|a kaˈprittʃo|}} (Italian: "following one's fancy") is a [[tempo]] marking indicating a free and [[Wiktionary:capricious|capricious]] approach to the tempo (and possibly the style) of the piece. This marking will usually modify another, such as ''lento a capriccio'', often used in the [[Hungarian Rhapsodies]] of [[Franz Liszt]]. Perhaps the most famous piece to use the term is [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''Rondò a capriccio'' (Op. 129), better known as ''[[Rage Over a Lost Penny]]''.

[[File:Frederic, Lord Leighton - Perseus and Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Perseus and Andromeda'' (Andromeda tied to the rock while [[Perseus]] on the winged horse Pegasus flies above), by [[Frederic Leighton]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|d|r|ɒ|m|ɪ|d|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀνδρομέδα, ''Androméda'' or Ἀνδρομέδη, ''Andromédē'') is the daughter of the [[Aethiopia]]n king [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and his wife [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]. When Cassiopeia's [[hubris]] leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], [[Poseidon]] sends the [[sea monster]] [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage Andromeda as divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Michael Grant &amp; John Hazel, Oxford University Press, 1973, 1993, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-19-521030-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Andromeda is chained to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by [[Perseus]].

Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδα}} (''Androméda'') or {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδη}} (''Andromédē''): "ruler of men",&lt;ref&gt;The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is, "she who has bravery in her mind"&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός}} (''anēr, andrós'') "man", and ''medon'', "ruler".

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a [[Greek hero]]'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic ''[[hieros gamos]]'' (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "[[princess and dragon]]" [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. From the [[Renaissance]], interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s account.

==Mythology==
[[Image:Museo Nazionale Napoli Perseus And Andromeda.jpg|left|thumb|A small Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]]]]

In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of the African kingdom of [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aethiopia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], the [[nymph]]-daughters of the sea god [[Nereus]] and often seen accompanying [[Poseidon]]. To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

[[Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]], [[Medusa]]. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing [[Cap of invisibility#Origins|Hades's helm]]), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Danaë]], and then to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]]. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]]. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].

At the port city of [[Jaffa]] (today part of [[Tel Aviv]]) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the geographer [[Strabo]] and the historian of the Jews [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias iv.35.9; Strabo xvi.2.28; Josephus, ''Jewish War'' iii.9.3&lt;/ref&gt;

After Andromeda's death, as [[Euripides]] had promised [[Athena]] at the end of his ''[[Andromeda (play)|Andromeda]]'', produced in 412 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959:53; Euripides' drama is lost, save some fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; the goddess placed her among the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]; the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], so known since antiquity, is named after her.

== Black Andromeda ==
Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Aethiopia (Αἰθιοπία) modern day [[Ethiopia]] ; Aethiopia roughly translates to "country of burnt faces", so we can conclude Andromeda was black. Prof. Elizabeth McGrath discusses this idea in her 1992 article ''The Black Andromeda'' &lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth McGrath, The Black Andromeda, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 55 (1992), pp. 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; based on Ovid's writings:

1. In his first work, the [[Heroides]] or Epistulae Heroidum (Epistles of the Heroines), [[Ovid]] uses the Latin word “fusca” to describe Andromeda, and “fusca” means “black or brown,” 

2. Also in ''[[Heroides]]'' he has [[Sapho]] explain to [[Phaon]]: “though I’m not pure white, Cepheus’s dark/Andromeda/charmed Perseus with her native colour./White doves often choose mates of different hue/and the parrot loves the black turtle dove.”

3. In ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (The Art of Love), [[Ovid]] makes the following references to the daughter of the king and queen of [[Ethiopia]]:

a. That Perseus found her among “the black Indians” 

b. That in terms of attraction, “Nor was Andromeda’s colour any problem/to her wing-footed aerial lover” 

c. That when it came to fashion, “White suits dark girls; you looked so attractive in/white/Andromeda”

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] wrote about the black Andromeda in a 2014 article &lt;ref name = The Black Andromeda &gt;[https://www.theroot.com/was-andromeda-black-1790874592 "Henry Louis Gates Jr on ''Was Andromeda Black?''"], The Root.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[The Root]] magazine. In his article Gates points out the inaccuracies seen in the film [[Clash of the Titans]]. The original, the remake and the sequel all have Andromeda cast as a white women, when [[Ovid]] describes her as black and both her parents were black. In his book ''Amazing Fact About the Negro'' &lt;ref&gt;Gates, L.H., ''100 Amazing Facts About the Negro'', New York, Pantheon, 2017, isbn=9780307908711&lt;/ref&gt; Gates has at No 68: ''What was the original colour of the mythical beauty Andromeda - and why does it matter?'' The book is his homage to [[Joel Rogers]] ''100 Amazing Facts About The Negro With Complete Proof''.

===Constellations===
[[Image:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|thumb|200px|''Andromeda'' (1869) [[Edward Poynter]]]]
Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

The advancement of science and technology allowed the emergence of astrophotography which allowed more concrete observation of the Andromeda constellation and led to the discovery that the galaxy lies within the Andromeda constellation.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, David A. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Rise of Modern Astronomy. New York, NY: Springer, 2012. Astronomers' Universe. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
* A huge man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]])
* A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]])
* A maiden, chained up, facing or turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]
* A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]])

Other constellations related to the story are:
* [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]
* The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her
* The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded

===In art===
[[File:1596 dArpino Perseus and Andromeda anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|Cesari: ''Perseus saving Andromeda'', 1596, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} including Greek vases. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera, ''[[Persée]]'', also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Perseus and Andromeda (Rubens)|many versions by Rubens]], [[Ingres]], and [[Gustave Moreau]]. From the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest.  [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

 |quote =&lt;poem&gt;
If by dull rhymes our English must be chain’d,
 And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
 Fetter’d, in spite of pained loveliness;
 Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,
 Sandals more interwoven and complete
 To fit the naked foot of poesy;
 Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
 Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d
 By ear industrious, and attention meet:
 Misers of sound and syllable, no less
 Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
 Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
 So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
 She will be bound with garlands of her own.
&lt;/poem&gt; |source ="If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd" &lt;br&gt; [[John Keats]] (1795–1821)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173739|title=If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd|publisher=Poetry Foundation |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Italian composer [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] composed an hour-long operatic drama called ''Perseo e Andromeda'' in 2000.

===In films===
* In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and Mуths of Ancient Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2626|title=тПУУЙКУЛБС БОЙНБГЙС Ч ВХЛЧБИ Й ЖЙЗХТБИ - жЙМШНЩ - "ретуек"|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=КиноПоиск.ru - Все фильмы планеты|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.
* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.
* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.
* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of "Prometheus Academy" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.

===In novels===
* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda. The most obvious is that the series' lead villains have a [[cruise ship]] which serves as their headquarters and is called ''The Princess Andromeda''.
* Andromeda is the main character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story "Miss Manners' Guide to Greek Missology", published in [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''Chicks in Chainmail'' series of humorous feminist fantasy collections, and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards. It is a satire filled with role reversals, puns, and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture.
* Andromeda is Anna's full name in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''[[My Sister's Keeper (novel)|My Sister's Keeper]]'', which was turned into a movie in 2010. In the novel there are several references to mythology, as Anna's dad Brian is an astronomer in his free time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32620">'''Arts-based environmental education''' (AEE) brings [[art education]] and [[environmental education]] together in one undertaking. The approach has two essential characteristics. The first is that it refers to a specific kind of environmental education that starts off from an artistic approach. Different from other types of [[Outdoor education|outdoor]] or environmental education which offer room for aesthetic experiences, AEE turns the tables in a fundamental way. Art is not an added quality, the icing on the cake; it is rather the point of departure in the effort to find ways in which people can connect to their environment. A second fundamental characteristic is that AEE is one of the first contemporary approaches of bringing together artistic practice and environmental education in which practitioners also made an attempt to formulate an [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/janvanboeckel/docs/jvanboeckel-attheheartofart-def_low/1 van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The roots of arts-based environmental education as it was developed in Finland ==

The term "arts-based environmental education" (AEE) was first coined by Finnish art educator Meri-Helga Mantere in the 1990s. Mantere describes AEE as a form of learning that aims to develop environmental understanding and responsibility “by becoming more receptive to sense perceptions and observations and by using artistic methods to express personal environmental experiences and thoughts”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Foreword%20to%20Image%20of%20the%20Earth.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Foreword. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 1-2). Helsinki: University of Art of Design], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic experiences improve one's ability to see; they help one in knowing and understanding. Therefore, she maintains that these can be of high value in learning about the environment. Mantere's description of her method of art-based environmental education can be taken as a first attempt at a definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What do I do as an environmentalist and as an art teacher? To put it rather simply: I try to support fresh perception, the nearby, personal enjoyment and pleasure of perceiving the world from the heart. To achieve that, it is necessary to stop, be quiet, have time and feel psychologically secure in order to perceive the unknown, the sometimes wild and unexpected. At times conscious training of the senses, decoding the stereotype, is needed. I aim at an openness to sensitivity, new and personal ways to articulate and share one’s environmental experiences which might be beautiful, disgusting, peaceful or threatening. I support and facilitate the conversation with the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Art%20and%20the%20environment.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1998). Art and the environment: An art-based approach to environmental education. In L. Rubinstein Reich (Ed.), Rapporter om utbildning, 3 (pp. 30-35). Malmö, Sweden: Lärarhögskolan.], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, Mantere's conception of AEE is grounded on the belief that sensitivity to the environment can be developed by artistic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Foreword. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 1-2). Helsinki: University of Art of Design, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist, and as a teacher and therapist, she came to find it more and more important to go back to the basics of the process and skill of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Coming%20Back%20to%20the%20Senses.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the question of how we perceive and how we receive or reject the messages of the environment is central. Important to underline - because it counters possible allegations of embracing a too Romantic view of nature – is that there is also room for the “shadow” side of experience, for feelings of disgust, fear and agony.

=== Early years of development ===

The historical antecedents of arts-based environmental education as it was developed in [[Finland]] go back to 1971, the year that the first European regional InSEA congress was held in that country. Finnish art educators had pooled their efforts to arrange this meeting
with the overarching theme “Environmental Protection in Art Education.” Pirkko Pohjakallio is a specialist on multidisciplinary approaches to environmental education in the context of Finnish art education since the 1970s. Quoting Kauppinen (1972), she provides the rationale for the congress at the time: “One reason for making the theme was the wish to emphasize the manifoldness and diversity of our environmental problems – [they] are not purely biological, economic and social ones but also aesthetic ones, and are consequently part of art education, not only as separate subjects of study but also as integrated parts of other subjects dealing with our living environment” (Kauppinen,&lt;ref&gt;Kauppinen, H. (1972). Preface (VII). In H. Kauppinen (Ed.), Environment and art education. InSEA 1971. Helsinki: Finnish Art Teachers’ Association.&lt;/ref&gt; cited in Pohjakallio, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Pohjakallio.pdf Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education.]&lt;/ref&gt; Already at that time, as Meri-Helga Mantere, notes, attention was paid to aesthetic and critical observation of the environment, both in the education of art teachers and in the curricula of Finnish schools. In the first decade, the focus of the kind of environmental education, practiced in Finland as part of art education, was on the man-made environment. Subjects were environmental pollution and the exploitation of nature. Problems of the environment were visually approached in teaching by identifying, classifying and listing the types and degrees of damages. As Mantere summarizes, “the emphasis was not so much on the environment as it was on politics”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Similarly, also Pirkko Pohjakallio notes that in the early 1970s, the prevailing interest in art teacher education and in visual arts first was in cultural studies and in linguistic and conceptual directions. The emphasis was on interpretations of expressions
of visual communication and on investigating if these revealed ideology and relations of power. It was a progressive move away from integrating art with crafts in the curriculum. Environmental education, at the time, concentrated on problems, and this was reflected in the images that were created in art classes, representing “dying nature, spoilt built environments, factories that polluted, and chaotic traffic jams”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In these times of social activism, practicing and becoming art teachers read the ecological and political pamphlets of the time. However, when they tried to address the themes and questions during art lessons, these proved so wide and difficult, that neither pupils nor teacher could envisage any solutions, leading to feelings of despair rather than empowerment. Ultimately this led to a dead end: “the use of conscious, threatening environmental scenarios and political topicalities as intellectual fuel proved to be a questionable idea”.

=== Change in the 1980s ===

The 1980s saw a change in Finland. From first being a subject that was limited to environmentally conscious groups and individuals interested in nature conservation, the earth's ecological state started to capture the interest of the general public. Art teaching gravitated to assisting learners in acquiring skills in reading and evaluating the language of the man-made environment. Parallel to that, in teacher education, issues stemming from environmental psychology and environmental aesthetics were discussed. Towards the end of the decade, new trends emerged. Art educators began to develop activities that were strongly influenced by down-to-earth phenomena in
environmental art and the new ecological awareness. A key figure in this development of a new approach to environmental education in the 1980s, as Pirkko Pohjakallio notes, was Meri-Helga Mantere. To the latter, an artistically oriented environmental education would be at its best when the artistic and creative perspective would run through the teaching project, from the stage of its planning to the evaluation of its results. Effectively, what this implied was that in the entire environmental education process the emphasis would be on the manner of observing, experiencing and thinking that is customary to art.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas before, art students, on basis of the prevailing orientation at the time of linguistic methods and critical theory, typically used collage of media images rather than personal and intimate contact with the actual environment, this now all began to change. To be sure, students were taken outdoors before by art educators as well, taking their pencils, drawing pads and brushes along. Here's the contrast, in Mantere's own words: "Now the purpose is to search for a more direct connection with the materiality as well as spirituality of nature. Sand, water, or any other environmental material became tools for reflection and expression. Also allusions to the mythical meanings of nature could be a starting point in the art exercises given to students."&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: University of Art of Design.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in the 1980s new expressionist painting, earth and environmental art emerged in society, these “were greeted as a breath of fresh air by art educators after the threatening images of the 1970s that had failed to empower those who had created them.”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Art students participated in courses on environmental pedagogy and camp schools were organized in “unspoilt” environments such as the Finnish archipelago and Lapland. Pohjakallio lists the following sources of inspiration for the new activities: deep ecology, gestalt therapy, experimental learning theories, and environmental aesthetics. Mantere notes that the ability and experience of Finnish art teachers to work in environmental education through artistic means began to draw the interest of environmental educators in general. What was attractive to them was this insight: “Attitudes and values do not seem to change through teaching that emphasizes scientific facts”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: University of Art of Design.&lt;/ref&gt; By consequence, she adds, emotional, aesthetic and practical methods became more and more appreciated. What came into focus was the pupil's own relationship with nature and the environment, which implied a holistic and hermeneutic approach to environmental issues. Pohjakallio adds that in the newly emerging arts-based environmental education, the life-world approach came to stand central. Through that emphasis on the idea that the environment is, first of all, ''inhabited'' by persons and not something remote or detached, aspects were taken up that had been mostly neglected in art education's earlier bearings in formalist and semiotic approaches. Characteristically, the inhabitant's relationship with the environment was participatory rather than solely informed by focused attention. It involved a two-way influence and identification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this approach, the environment is as much a drama and narrative as a set of critical insights and political views. In life-world, environmental aesthetics, all the senses contribute to understanding, so that the environment is as much felt as understood. It is partly a tacit affair – but not, as a consequence, beyond theorizing."&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We thus see that the 1980s were in many respects a turning point. It saw the genesis of, what Mantere termed, the new environmental education (through art). A movement had emerged in art education, in which, according to Mantere, the freedom and courage to have confidence in “art as art” was central. Concomitantly, the word “process” became nothing less than essential, and the artistic process came to be seen not only as a psychically integrative, individual experience but also as a (if not the most)legitimate basis for the teaching of art. The ideas of Jung and art therapy in general influenced and inspired many Finnish art teachers. As Mantere puts it, “one could hardly talk about the soul in public, [but] one could at least talk about some kind of spirituality”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? In M. Laukka, M. Lähteenaho, &amp; P. Pohjakallio (Eds.), Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: Faculty of Art Education, University of Industrial Arts, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of the time was that many teachers began to discuss their own situation as artists.

An important parallel development was the emergence in Finland of special art schools for children. In contrast to the compulsory comprehensive schools, these provided a new opportunity to develop artistically demanding and at cases long-term projects.

=== The importance of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and the rise of the concept of sustainability ===

In 1992, a little more than twenty years after the landmark 1971 InSEA conference in Helsinki, the [[Earth Summit]] took place in Rio de Janeiro, the big UN Conference on Environment and Development. Again, an InSEA conference was held in Finland. At this occasion, Mantere articulated the specific Finnish approach to an international readership more fully in her seminal article “Ecology, Environmental Education and Art Teaching” (which appeared in the InSEA publication ''Power of Images'', 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Ecology,%20Environmental%20Education%20and%20Art%20Teaching.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland.]&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that, in her view, ecological thinking and action should be regarded as a guiding principle of all education. Furthermore, art education could play an important
role in the development of new forms of environmental education. To her, a genuine appreciation of nature and motivation to act for the good of the environment are based above all on positive and valued experiences and these are often of an aesthetic nature. Such experiences, she went on to say, can be generated by open and immediate contact with the phenomena of nature and the often new and fresh view of these phenomena that art provides. To her, to perceive “better” is the necessary starting point to creative change
in personal and collective decision making and lifestyles.

Mantere presents several arguments to support her claim that art education can play an important role in the new environmental education. All of these rely, as she puts it in her article in ''Power of Images'', on “the artistic apprehension” of life and the environment, and on the opportunities that lend themselves to artistic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, she emphasizes that appreciating one's experiences, emotional expressions and subjective processing of things is at the core of art education. For that reason, aesthetic practice could be an extremely valuable contribution to experiential learning in environmental education (which she held as the latter's most fruitful and functional principle). In artmaking, participants learn by doing. Everything begins with personal experience. Simultaneously, art teaching encourages participants to discover, unearth and also to lend weight to their own mental images. These two combined, mean that art education can offer a mode in which learners can engage with their experiences and observations of the environment through artistic activity. This can be done by working with mental images, tangible pictorial expressions, etc., and by bringing to bear matured levels of reflection and conceptualization. As such, artistic activity actually constitutes cognitive action and learning in its own right.

Secondly, Mantere also underscores the need to create positive visions and concepts for the future. Sustainable development is not only about conservation but also about creating the new: better environments, objects and lifestyles. It is in the design of these that art education can play a vital role. Moreover, it is of great value if pupils become active themselves on behalf of the environment, in short, that a change of attitude is brought about. Finally, Mantere calls attention in her article to the critical insight that when an ecological lifestyle is primarily seen in terms of restriction and austerity, then it is more likely that change will only be accepted as a last resort. Through art, “it is also possible to develop the mythical, metaphorical and deep-level psychological levels of man’s relationship with nature into a constructive resource, in which factual information achieves deeper meanings”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; For Mantere, art is often therapeutic, but this aspect is seldom mentioned.

=== AEE and environmental art ===
In his article “From Environmental Art to Environmental Education,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/From%20environmental%20art%20to%20environmental%20education_Timo%20Jokela.pdf Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design.]&lt;/ref&gt; Timo Jokela, professor in art education at the University of Lapland, claims that the visual arts can offer elements to environmental education that are lacking in other fields. To him, “artistic-aesthetic learning” involves observation, experience and increasing awareness. Art sharpens our schemes of observation and activity, and thus facilitates bringing the phenomena to our consciousness. Art continuously creates new ways of observing. Even more so, visual art can be understood as actually being a history of evolving and varying schemes of observation. Previous learning experiences dominate the way in which we subsequently observe and describe our environment, says Jokela. He underpins this claim by quoting [[Arnold Berleant]], as follows: “environments are not physical places but perceptual ones that we collaborate in making, and it is perceptually that we determine their identity and extent”.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, quoted in Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jokela, the “environmental world” and the “art world” share an educational task. [[Environmental art]], for him, is first and foremost art that is defined by the place it is made; it is created, as it were, by the environment. Its historical antecedents go back
to the 1960s (e.g. the practices of “[[earth art]]” and “[[land art]]”). The Finnish art educator goes on to list four types of exercises that illustrate how environmental art can be a method of environmental education. On the one hand, these exercises are faithful to the practice of environmental art and as such they are a basic part of art education. On the other hand, they are also methods for increasing one's sensitivity towards the environment. In the latter sense, they are essentially environmental education. These are the categories that Jokela provides:

•  Exercises on focusing your observations and perceiving them more sensitively;

•  Exercises which bring forward the processes happening in nature, and help one in perceiving them more sensitively: growth and decay, the flow of water, the turning of day and night, the changes of light, the wind, etc.;

•  Exercises which aim to alter set ways of viewing the environment;

•  Exercises which test the scale of the environment and human “limits.” The starting point is a large amount of material and the aim is a clear change in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design, p. 25-36&lt;/ref&gt;

A binding factor in Jokela's categories is the implicit driving force: they are exercises that work towards achieving or accomplishing a pre-established goal; they “aim at.” Mantere makes an illuminating distinction between (a) seeing art as a tool of environmental education, (b) seeing art itself as a form of environmental education and (c) seeing environmental education as a form of art. Each alternative, she says, is possible and tones the content and activity in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Tracking a course in the landscape of environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 3-17). Helsinki: University of Art of Design&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AEE: nor 'pure' environmental education, nor 'pure' arts education ===
A composite approach such as arts-based environmental education inevitably always seems to fall between two stools: it is neither environmental education proper (because it starts off from an arts- rather than science-based perspective), nor can it convincingly be classified as a subfield of art education, as it moves away from artmaking as primarily a self-referential discipline (“l’art pour l’art”). In fact, one could say that two rather separate communities of art educators and environmental educators exist, often not understanding (or more often not aware of) each other's discourse, hence bringing along the problem of incommensurability of the paradigms from which they each approach education.

In an interview that Jan van Boeckel held with Mantere in 2007, he invited her to expand further on her conceptualization of the combining of art education and environmental education, and the way she considered that participants learn about the environment through art:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One learns by observing the connection between outer and inner. One learns by using the senses. One gets sensitive when one learns that all the senses are (or can be) involved. When they are involved or enlivened or opened, you also get more original feelings or observations. The observations that one makes of art, of nature, of other people and one’s self, the environment or whatever, can be led by knowledge, learning theories, and so on, and that is one way to observe. In such cases one already has some kind of frame or concepts. But in this case the learning comes from being open to, and learning through, one’s senses. At those moments there are no ready-made words, concepts and structures. The artistic learning, or the artistic approach, goes to the basics of senses and feelings, to the fresh contact and presence. An artistic approach includes the sensitivity of one’s body movement and senses. Via sight or touch you study the environment, but if you hurry to name it you lose the newness. You get a touch, you get a smell, you get movement, you hear your environment. And when this happens without naming and ready-made concepts and repetitions, you always get a new experience. It is possible to get fresh, nonverbal information all the time. So the senses and observations can be creative and they kind of bring up your own images, words and conceptualizations."&lt;ref&gt;M.-H. Mantere, cited in van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Mantere touches upon two contrasting forces within AEE: the more passive not-knowing while being open to one's senses, and the more active learning that takes place when integrating the new information. One has to shift, as it were, from one state of mind to the other.

One way to understand an AEE activity is to see it as a facilitated effort in which participants are encouraged to open their senses and to connect to and learn from their environment. The pedagogical point of departure in this is artistic practice rather than science-based learning. This orientation, however, should not be seen as being in opposition to other approaches of learning and acquiring knowledge. Instead, artmaking is conceived of as a (as of yet highly undervalued) way of learning and understanding in itself, complementary to other modes.

As we saw, Mantere herself emphasizes in her texts the value of experiential subjective learning processes, which she contrasts with science-based experimental knowledge. At the same time, she underlines that an art educator needs to know the scientific ecological basics like cycles of water and energy and materials used; he or she needs to be aware of the ecological threats of today: “I think that to plan an AEE workshop or lesson not knowing or caring about the ecological aspects is not environmental education at all and thus not AEE as I understand it”.&lt;ref&gt;M.-H. Mantere, cited in van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in her view, art educators ought to be able to explain in what ways the arts and aesthetics may contribute to enhancing the aims of EE as a whole, in cases where they work together with science teachers.

Nevertheless, she also holds that AEE methods, in the effort to support perceiving the world from the heart, can only achieve such fresh perception through a stop. For it is at that point that learners begin to be receptive and “to perceive the unknown, the
delicate, the sometimes wild and unexpected”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1998). Art and the environment: An art-based approach to environmental education. In L. Rubinstein Reich (Ed.), Rapporter om utbildning, 3 (pp. 30-35). Malmö, Sweden: Lärarhögskolan, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; When, through conscious training in the senses, the predominant cultural and personal stereotypes are decoded, not only the participant's perception becomes very different, but also his or her articulation of these in words and picture. When the subjective is both supported and facilitated by the art teacher, “more and more unconventional conversations with the environment follow”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.&lt;/ref&gt; From her background in art, Mantere has tried to meet the challenges posed by the environmental imperatives of today. She did this by using strategies and methods that are derived from experience and knowledge of art and art education and even the world of art therapy. She mentions that important sources of inspiration were some of the Finnish traditions connected with the forest and the international field of environmental art. Further, philosopher [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] and psychologist [[James Hillman]] were important mentors to her. Art touches the heart and it is the speech of soul, she quotes the latter saying.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary ===
In this overview of the way in which a specific form of arts-based environmental education developed in Finland the following core traits to be distinguished. First, one has to distinguish between the first phase of AEE in the 1970s which focused on visual imagery of the ecological crisis, and its second phase, when this perspective was complemented – if not to some extent replaced – by a more sensorially-grounded approach in which personal direct experiences of both the natural and built environment became characteristic. It is to this second phase of AEE, which emerged in the 1980s, that my attention is mostly focused, the idea that a relationship with nature can be built through the senses: the art teacher puts his or her trust in experiential learning and the teaching can move out of the classroom. The pupils are encouraged to open their senses by artistic practices, which can be almost anything from drawing and building out of natural materials to making conceptual art. Through these practices it is hoped that the pupils recognize and study their own relationship with the surrounding environment. In this, the artistic result is less important. The goal for art education is to emotionally involve pupils and to develop their ability to see the traces we leave in the landscape.

Part of this is to see the environment through art, and art through the environment.  People would be educated by that environmental art or sculpture and it is a good approach to do art-base environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marks, L. Chandler &amp; C. Baldwin (2016): Environmental art as an innovative medium for environmental education in Biosphere Reserves, Environmental Education Research, DOI: 10.1080/13504622.2016.1214864
&lt;/ref&gt; A forest, for example, can provide the materials for making art – interpreted by traditional techniques or through conceptual art. Part of the focus is to train the students’ artistic view, so that they see and express aesthetic qualities and values in both the built and natural environment. Distinctive to the Finnish approach is an inclination to keep the process open-ended and not to work necessarily towards reaching a preconceived and –defined goal, and the other is that practitioners of the teaching of AEE tend to see the importance of (and actively engage in) the unpacking of the epistemological foundations of their work. In her foreword to the book ''Image of the Earth, Writing on Art-based Environmental Education'', Mantere speaks of a “we,” that is a group of Finnish artists and art teachers at the university level. Though she grants that the book is not a comprehensive account of AEE, the opening lines do have an authoritative and programmatic ring to them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We believe that it is possible to develop environmental understanding and responsibility by becoming more receptive to sense perceptions and observations, and by using artistic methods to express personal environmental experiences and thoughts. Artistic experiences and activities improve one’s ability to see; they help one in knowing and understanding. The issues of values and lifestyle, raised by the ecological crisis, can be approached by artistic methods, reaching otherwise unattainable areas of experience."&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995).

The '''Bandim Health Project''' works with population based health research in one of the world's poorest countries, [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.

The core of the project is a health and [[Demography|demographic surveillance]] system which registers more than 100,000 people in six suburbs of the capital [[Bissau]]. Furthermore, 182 representative clusters of 100 women and their children are followed in the rural areas. Information on health, diseases, immunisations, breast-feeding, etc. is collected, primarily focusing on women and children. Admissions to the country's sole [[Pediatrics|pediatric ward]] in the capital are recorded.

The Bandim Health Project is member of the INDEPTH Network of health and demographic surveillance sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania.

==History==
The Bandim Health Project was initiated in 1978 by Peter Aaby. The project is currently based on collaboration between the [[Ministry of Health]] in Guinea-Bissau, [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark, and researchers affiliated to The [[University of Southern Denmark]], as well as the [[University of Aarhus]], Denmark.

In 2012, the Danish National Research Foundation funded the establishment of the Center of Excellence, The Research Center for Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA) based on the Bandim Health Project and its research into [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]].

==Fields of research==
The Bandim Health Project works with population based health research, focusing on women and children. The project's fields of research include:
* '''[[Vaccine]]s''', both their specific effects on the targeted diseases, and in particular their potential [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects]] on [[incidence (epidemiology)|morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]].
* '''Other [[health intervention]]s''', including assessment of the total impact on mortality of new interventions or changes in existing policies.
* '''[[Infectious disease]]s''', e.g. [[measles]], [[diarrhoea]], [[rotavirus]], [[respiratory infection]]s, [[malaria]], HIV, [[HTLV]], and [[Tuberculosis]].
* '''Nutrition''', including [[micronutrient]]s such as [[vitamin A]] supplementation, and [[breast-feeding]].
* '''[[Humanitarian aid]].

==Important results==
One of the most important findings was that a new [[measles vaccine]] used in [[Developing country|low-income countries]] was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine.&lt;ref name=WHO92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|volume=67|pages=1992|pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had it not been withdrawn, it could have cost at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P., et al.

==The organization==
The Bandim Health Project is led by Peter Aaby. The National Research Coordinator is Amabelia Rodrigues. Since the project's foundation in 1978, more than 700 [[scientific article]]s have been published, and more than 40 PhD or [[doctoral degree]]s and 13 [[Master's degree|Masters]] of International Health degrees have been obtained by researchers employed by the project.

===Affiliations===
Bandim Health Project is placed in Guinea-Bissau and also has a small department at [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark. Bandim Health Project is also affiliated with [[University of Southern Denmark]], where Peter Aaby is an [[adjunct professor]] and Christine Benn holds a professorship in Global Health.

'''Biblical hermeneutics''' is the study of the principles of interpretation concerning the [[books of the Bible]]. It is part of the broader field of [[hermeneutics]] which involves the study of principles of interpretation for all forms of communication, nonverbal and verbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

While [[Talmudical Hermeneutics|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] Biblical hermeneutics have some [[Judeo-Christian|overlap]] and [[Interfaith|dialogue]], they have distinctly separate interpretative traditions.

==Talmudical==
{{main|Talmudical hermeneutics}}

Talmudical hermeneutics ([[Hebrew]]: approximately, מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) refers to Jewish methods for the investigation and determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], as well as rules by which [[Halakhah|Jewish law]] could be established.  One well-known summary of these principles appears in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Methods by which the [[Talmud]] explores the meaning of scripture:
:* [[grammar]] and [[exegesis]]
:* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes
:* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with points
:* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see [[Gematria]])
:* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see [[Notarikon]])
:* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization
:* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels
:* the logical deduction of a ''[[halakah]]'' from a Scriptural text or from another law

The rabbis of the Talmud considered themselves to be the receivers and transmitters of an [[Oral Torah]] as to the meaning of the scriptures. They considered this [[oral tradition]] to set forth the precise, original meanings of the words, revealed at the same time and by the same means as the original scriptures themselves. Interpretive methods listed above such as word play and letter counting were never used as logical proof of the meaning or teaching of a scripture. Instead they were considered to be an ''asmakhta'', a validation of a meaning that was already set by tradition or a [[Homiletics|homiletic]] backing for rabbinic rulings.

==Christian==

Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], biblical hermeneutics was usually seen as a form of special hermeneutics (like legal hermeneutics); the status of scripture was thought to necessitate a particular form of understanding and interpretation.

In the nineteenth century it became increasingly common to read scripture just like any other writing, although the different interpretations were often disputed. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued against a distinction between "general" and "special" hermeneutics, and for a general theory of hermeneutics applicable to all [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], including the Bible. Various methods of [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] sought to understand the Bible purely as a human, historical document.

The concept of hermeneutics has acquired at least two different but related meanings which are in use today. Firstly, in the older sense, biblical hermeneutics may be understood as the theological principles of exegesis which is often virtually synonymous with 'principles of biblical interpretation' or methodology of [[biblical exegesis]]. Secondly, the more recent development is to understand the term 'biblical hermeneutics' as the broader [[philosophical|philosophy]] and [[linguistic]] underpinnings of interpretation. The question is posed: "How is understanding possible?" The rationale of this approach is that, while Scripture is "more than just an ordinary text," it is certainly "no less than an ordinary text." Scripture is in the first analysis "text" which human beings try to understand; in this sense, the principles of understanding any text apply to the Bible as well (regardless of whatever other additional, specifically theological principles are considered).

In this second sense, all aspects of philosophical and linguistic hermeneutics are considered to be applicable to the biblical texts, as well. There are obvious examples of this in the links between [[20th-century philosophy]] and Christian [[theology]]. For example, [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s hermeneutical approach was strongly influenced by [[existentialism]], and in particular by the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]]; and since the 1970s, the philosophical hermeneutics of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] have had a wide-ranging influence on biblical hermeneutics as developed by a wide range of Christian theologians. The French-American philosopher [[René Girard]] follows a similar trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation|year=2005|publisher=University of Bristol|location=Bristol Baptist College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse interpretations===
Biblical scholars have noted the diversity of interpretations by [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and to a lesser extent by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. In his forward to [[R. C. Sproul]]’s ''Knowing Scripture'', [[J. I. Packer]] observes that Protestant theologians are in conflict about biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'' (Rev. ed., InterVarsity Press, 2009), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate the diversity of biblical interpretations, William Yarchin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apu.edu/honors/faculty/byarchin/&lt;/ref&gt; pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;William Yarchin, ''History of Biblical Interpretation: a Reader'' (Hendrickson, 2004), xi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Ramm]] observed that such diverse interpretations underlie the doctrinal variations in Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ramm, ''Protestant Biblical Interpretation:A Textbook of Hermeneutics, 3rd rev ed'' (Baker Academic, 1980), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation observed that even those who believe the Bible to be the word of God hold the most discordant views about fundamental doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''The Interpretation of the Bible'' (Boston; Massachusetts Sabbath School Society, 1844), 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church asserts the capital importance of biblical interpretation and Catholic scholars recognize some diversity in the Bible. This allows for an openness of interpretation as long as it stays within the Catholic Church’s theological Tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Williamson, ''Catholic Principles for Interpreting Scripture: A Study of the Pontifical Biblical Commission’s “The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church”'' (Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 2001), 23, 121, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; So it is that theological factors set the parameters for interpreting the Scripture that Catholics believe to be the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Williams, ''Receiving the Bible in Faith: Historical and Theological Exegesis'' (CUA Press, 2004), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters disallow the widely differing interpretations that make it possible for Protestants to prove almost anything by the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Roy B. Zuck, ''Basic Bible Interpretation'' (David C. Cook, 1991), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological hermeneutics as traditional Christian Biblical exegesis===

This form of [[theological hermeneutics]] in the mainstream Protestant tradition considers Christian Biblical hermeneutics in the tradition of explication of the text, or [[exegesis]], to deal with various principles that can be applied to the study of [[Scripture]]. If the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of Scripture is considered as an organic whole, rather than an accumulation of disparate individual texts written and edited in the course of history, then any interpretation that contradicts any other part of scripture is not considered to be sound. Biblical hermeneutics differs from hermeneutics and within traditional Protestant [[theology]], there are a variety of interpretive formulae. Such formulae are generally not mutually exclusive, and interpreters may adhere to several of these approaches at once. These formulae include:&lt;ref&gt;This list of "principles" in conservative [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] hermeneutics appears to derive from: Hartill, J E 1960. ''Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theological Group of Principles''':

:*The '''[[Historical-grammatical method|Historical-grammatical]]''' principle based on historical, socio-political, geographical, cultural and linguistic / grammatical context
:*Alternate, mutually-exclusive, models of history:
:**The '''[[Dispensationalism|Dispensational model]]''' or The '''Chronometrical Principle''': "During different periods of time, God has chosen to deal in a particular way with man in respect to sin and man's responsibility."
:**The '''[[Covenantalism|Covenantal model]]''': "We differentiate between the various contracts that God has made with his people; specifically their provisions, their parties and their purposes."
:**The '''[[New Covenant Theology|New-Covenantal]]''' model: The Old Testament Laws have been fulfilled and abrogated or cancelled with Christ's death, and replaced with the Law of Christ of the New Covenant, although many of the Old Covenant laws are reinstituted under the New Covenant.
:*The '''Ethnic Division Principle''': "The word of truth is rightly divided in relation to the three classes which it treats, i.e. Jews, [[Gentiles]] and the Church."
:*The '''Breach Principle''': Interpretation of a certain verse or passage in Scripture is aided by a consideration of certain breaches, either breaches of promise or breaches of time.
:*The '''[[Christo-Centric Principle]]''': "The mind of deity is eternally centered in Christ. All angelic thought and ministry are centered in Christ. All Satanic hatred and subtlety are centered at Christ. All human hopes are, and human occupations should be, centered in Christ. The whole material universe in creation is centered in Christ. The entire written word is centered in Christ."
:*The '''Moral Principle'''
:*The '''Discriminational Principle''': "We should divide the word of truth so as to make a distinction where God makes a difference."
:*The '''Predictive Principle'''
:*The '''Application Principle''': "An application of truth may be made only after the correct interpretation has been made"
:*The '''Principle of Human Willingness in Illumination'''
:*The '''Context Principle''': "God gives light upon a subject through either near or remote passages bearing upon the same subject."

'''Sub-divided Context/Mention Principles''':
:*The '''First Mention Principle''': "God indicates in the first mention of a subject the truth with which that subject stands connected in the mind of God."
:*The '''Progressive Mention Principle''': "God makes the revelation of any given truth increasingly clear as the word proceeds to its consummation."
:*The '''Comparative Mention Principle'''
:*The '''Full Mention Principle''' or The '''Complete Mention Principle''': "God declares his full mind upon any subject vital to our spiritual life."
:*The '''Agreement Principle''': "The truthfulness and faithfulness of God become the guarantee that he will not set forth any passage in his word that contradicts any other passage."
:*The '''Direct Statement Principle''': "God says what he means and means what he says."
:*The '''Gap Principle''': "God, in the Jewish Scriptures, ignores certain periods of time, leaping over them without comment."
:*The '''Threefold Principle''': "The word of God sets forth the truths of salvation in a three-fold way: past - justification; present - sanctification/transformation; future - glorification/consummation."
:*The '''Repetition Principle''': "God repeats some truth or subject already given, generally with the addition of details not before given."
:*The '''Synthetic Principle'''
:*The '''Principle of Illustrative Mention'''
:*The '''Double Reference Principle'''

'''Figures of Speech Group of Principles''':
:*The '''Numerical Principle'''
:*The '''Symbolic Principle'''
:*The '''Typical Principle''': "Certain people, events, objects and rituals found in the Old Testament may serve as object lessons and pictures by which God teaches us of his grace and saving power."
:*The '''Parabolic Principle'''
:*The '''Allegorical Principle'''

==Techniques==
In the interpretation of a text, hermeneutics considers the original medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:wire-conference&amp;catid=3:newsflash|title=Biblical Performance Criticism|first=Peter|last=Perry|date=|website=www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as what language says, supposes, doesn't say, and implies. The process consists of several steps for best attaining the Scriptural author's intended meaning(s).  One such process is taught by Henry A Virkler, in ''Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation'' (1981):

:*'''Lexical-syntactical analysis''': This step looks at the words used and the way the words are used.  Different order of the sentence, the punctuation, the tense of the verse are all aspects that are looked at in the lexical syntactical method.  Here, lexicons and grammar aids can help in extracting meaning from the text.
:*'''Historical/cultural analysis''': The history and culture surrounding the authors is important to understand to aid in interpretation.  For instance, understanding the Jewish sects of the Palestine and the government that ruled Palestine in New Testament times increases understanding of Scripture.  And, understanding the connotations of positions such as the High Priest and that of the tax collector helps us know what others thought of the people holding these positions.
:*'''Contextual analysis''': A verse out of context can often be taken to mean something completely different from the intention.  This method focuses on the importance of looking at the context of a verse in its chapter, book and even biblical context.
:*'''Theological analysis''': It is often said that a single verse usually doesn't make a theology.  This is because Scripture often touches on issues in several books.  For instance, gifts of the Spirit are spoken about in Romans, Ephesians and 1 Corinthians.  To take a verse from Corinthians without taking into account other passages that deal with the same topic can cause a poor interpretation.
:*'''Special literary analysis''': There are several special literary aspects to look at, but the overarching theme is that each genre of Scripture has a different set of rules that applies to it.  Of the genres found in Scripture, there are: narratives, histories, prophecies, apocalyptic writings, poetry, psalms and letters.  In these, there are differing levels of allegory, figurative language, metaphors, similes and literal language.  For instance, the apocalyptic writings and poetry have more figurative and allegorical language than does the narrative or historical writing.  These must be addressed, and the genre recognized to gain a full understanding of the intended meaning.

[[Howard Hendricks]], longtime professor of hermeneutics at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], set out the method of observing the text, interpreting the text, applying the text in his book, ''Living By the Book''. Other major Christian teachers, such as [[Chuck Swindoll|Charles R. (Chuck) Swindoll]], who wrote the foreword, [[Kay Arthur]] and [[David Jeremiah]] have based their hermeneutics on the principles Hendricks teaches.

In his book ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'' (1999), [[Vern Poythress]], Professor of New Testament Interpretation at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia, presented a hermeneutical technique based on the pattern of "speaker, discourse, and hearer".&lt;ref&gt;Poythress, Vern S. (1999). ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'', p. 109. P&amp;R Publishing, Phillipsburg, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Poythress, the study of the Bible must acknowledge all three aspects: God as the speaker, the Bible as His speech, and the people to whom He speaks. Thus, context plays a primary role in Poythress's study of Biblical teachings. He lists three general concepts to understand about any passage of Scripture:

:*'''Original time and context''': This includes the personal perspective of the writer, the normative perspective of the text itself, and the situational perspective of the original audience.

:*'''Transmission and its context''': Understanding the transmission of Scripture includes contemplating the message being sent through the text, taking into account the concerns of individual writers/translators as well as its broader role in the unraveling narrative of history. 

:*'''Modern context''': Poythress calls interpreters to understand Scripture as "what God is saying now" to the individual as well as to the modern church.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 121 -122&lt;/ref&gt; 

David L. Barr states there are three obstacles that stand in the way of correctly interpreting the biblical writings: We speak a different language, we live approximately two millennia later, and we bring different expectations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament Story, Wadsworth Publishing, 1995, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Barr suggests that we approach the reading of the Bible with significantly different literary expectations than those in reading other forms of literature and writing.

===Roman Catholic===
{{see also|Roman Catholic theology of Scripture}} 
The Catholic Encyclopedia lists a number of principles guiding Roman Catholic hermeneutics in the article on Exegesis (note: the Catholic Encyclopedia was written in 1917 and does not reflect the changes set forth by the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' published by Pius XII in 1943, which opened modern Catholic Biblical scholarship) :

:*'''Historico-grammatical interpretation''' - The meaning of the literary expression of the Bible is best learned by a thorough knowledge of the languages in which the original text of Scripture was written, and by acquaintance with the Scriptural way of speaking, including the various customs, laws, habits and national prejudices which influenced the inspired writers as they composed their respective books. [[John Paul II]] said that: "A second conclusion is that the very nature of biblical texts means that interpreting them will require continued use of the historical-critical method, at least in its principal procedures. The Bible, in effect, does not present itself as a direct revelation of timeless truths but as the written testimony to a series of interventions in which God reveals himself in human history. In a way that differs from tenets of other religions [such as Islam, for instance], the message of the Bible is solidly grounded in history.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/PBC_Interp5.htm|title=The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church|accessdate=2007-05-21|author=Presented by the Pontifical Biblical Commission|date=1993-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Catholic interpretation''' - Because the Catholic Church is, according to Catholics, the official custodian and interpreter of the Bible, Catholicism's teaching concerning the Sacred Scriptures and their genuine sense must be the supreme guide of the commentator. The Catholic commentator is bound to adhere to the interpretation of texts which the Church has defined either expressly or implicitly.
:*'''Reverence''' - Since the Bible is God's own book, its study must be begun and prosecuted with a spirit of reverence and [[Christian Prayers|prayer]].
:*'''Inerrancy''' - Since God is the principal Author of Sacred Scripture, it can be claimed to contain no error, no self-contradiction, nothing contrary to scientific or historical truth (when the original authors intended historical or scientific truth to be portrayed).  Minor contradictions are due to copyist errors in the codex or the translation. Catholics believe the Scripture is God's message put in words by men, with the imperfections this very fact necessarily implies. Catholic hermeneutics strongly supports inerrancy when it comes to principles but not, for example, when dealing with Evangelists' orthographic mistakes. According to Pope John Paul II, "Addressing men and women, from the beginnings of the Old Testament onward, God made use of all the possibilities of human language, while at the same time accepting that his word be subject to the constraints caused by the limitations of this language. Proper respect for inspired Scripture requires undertaking all the labors necessary to gain a thorough grasp of its meaning.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"/&gt;
:*'''Patristics''' - The Holy Fathers are of supreme authority whenever they all interpret in one and the same manner any text of the Bible, as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpretation has come down from the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith.
Pope Benedict XVI has indicated in Verbum Domini, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the Word of God, that "Christianity...perceives in the words the Word himself, the Logos who displays his mystery through this complexity and the reality of human history". He encourages a “faith-filled interpretation of Sacred Scripture”. He emphasizes that this manner of interpretation, “practiced from antiquity within the Church’s Tradition...recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition". It "seeks to discover the living meaning of the Sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres". Verbum Domini #44.

===Eastern Orthodox===
:*'''God is real and is incarnated in our [[Lord]] Jesus Christ.'''  Everything pertaining to the Scriptures must be understood [[Christology|Christologically]].  [[Jesus Christ]], the incarnate Second Person of the [[Holy Trinity]], is the center of all that we as Christians do, and being Himself the very Truth, He is the only gate through which we may enter into understanding of the Bible, both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s (though not all that is contained in the Old Testament is directly relevant for Christians).  The Bible ultimately is about Christ and assists us in our union with Him.

:*'''Only the pure in heart "shall see God."'''  That is, our spiritual state has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the Scriptures.  As St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] said, "One cannot possibly understand the teaching of the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their life."  Because the Scripture is a book inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]] and given through holy men, one's own holiness is directly relevant to the ability to interpret the book correctly.  Unlike any other book, the Bible's words are "spirit and life," and so we must live spiritually in order to drink from this spiritual well.  Clearly, [[prayer]] and spiritual discipline are necessary in order to understand Scripture properly.

:*'''Understanding of the Scripture comes with living its contents.'''  As the quote from St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] illustrates, one must both have a pure mind and be trying to imitate the saints' lives in order to understand their teaching, a dual principle which applies most of all to the teaching of the saints in the Bible.  This life is particularly expressed in terms of living out the commandments and attempting to imitate Christ's life of the Gospel.

:*'''The primary end of Scriptural hermeneutics is that of the whole Christian life, [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] (deification/divinization).'''  That is, our purpose in attempting to understand the Bible must not be merely for academic inquiry but rather must be in order to become fully divinized human beings, soaked with the life of God, participating in His [[divine energies]], growing to the fullness of the stature of Christ.  We interpret Scripture in order to become by grace what Christ is by nature, to "become god."

:*'''Only within the community of the Church can the Bible be understood.'''  It was written by the Church, in the Church and for the Church.  Thus, it is a "family document" which is the highest point of [[Holy Tradition]], taken with faith alongside the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]], the [[Divine Liturgy|Liturgy]], the [[Icons]], the Lives of the [[Saints]], and so on.

:*'''The Scripture is a witness to the truth, not an exhaustive tome on Christian living.''' Nowhere in the words of Scripture itself can we find the teaching that it is all-sufficient for Christian life.  What we as Orthodox Christians do must always be consonant with the Scriptures, but explicit mention of a practice or teaching in the Scripture is not a requirement for its inclusion in the life of the Church.  The [[Apostle Paul]] himself mentions the reality of unwritten sources of Church Tradition being equally in force for the believer in [[II Thessalonians]] 2:15, that these traditions to which we must "stand fast and hold" may be "by word or by our epistle."  Examples of practices not explicit in Scripture are making the [[Sign of the Cross]], triple immersion for [[baptism]], and having [[monasticism]].  St. [[Basil the Great]] even says that without maintaining the unwritten traditions of the Church, we "mutilate the Gospel" (''On the Spirit'' 66).

:*'''We must respect the integrity of the canon of the Bible as given to us in the Church's Tradition.'''  Searches for other texts written by apostles or prophets may be interesting and of scholarly merit, but they are not part of the hermeneutical project within the Church. Or conversely, attempts to debunk the authorship or authenticity of the books in the canon are also outside the Church's life.  If we were to find a verifiable "new" work by St. Paul or to discover that [[Moses]] did not in fact write [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], neither finding would have any bearing on the [[Biblical canon|canon]].  It is what it is.

:*'''We must use every resource at our disposal in interpreting the Scripture to bring ourselves and others to the knowledge of the truth.'''  Certainly, there must be spiritual discernment in knowing how to use those resources, but at least theoretically, anything can be used to come to know the truth better as it is revealed in Holy Writ.

:*'''We must have humility when approaching Scripture.'''  Even some of the Church's greatest and most philosophically sophisticated [[saints]] stated that some passages were difficult for them.  We must therefore be prepared to admit that our interpretations may be wrong, submitting them to the judgment of the Church.

:*'''We may make use in a secondary fashion of the resources of academic scholarship, whether logic, archaeology, linguistics, et cetera.'''  These resources can be helpful in terms of illuminating our understanding of Scripture, but they must always be given only secondary prominence in the project and always only in conjunction with all these other hermeneutic principles.  Primary must always be our life in the Church, living, studying and knowing the Bible within that vivified and salvific [[Holy Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archpriest Michael Dahulich|title=OrthodoxWiki article on Hermeneutics|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Hermeneutics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary reader of Scripture is in some way envisaged by the Biblical text as standing in continuity with a developing theme therein. The reader, then, is left to discern this trajectory and appropriate it accordingly.

[[William J. Webb]] employed such a hermeneutic, in his ''Slaves, Women &amp; Homosexuals''. Webb shows how the moral commands of the Old and New Testament were a significant improvement over the surrounding cultural values and practices. Webb identified 18 different ways in which God dealt with his people moving against the current of popular cultural values. While for Webb the use of this hermeneutic moves to highlight the progressive liberation of women and slaves from oppressive male/bourgeois dominance, the prohibition of [[homosexual]] acts consistently moves in a more conservative manner than that of the surrounding [[Ancient Near East]] or [[Graeco-Roman]] societies. While Paul does not explicitly state that [[slavery]] should be abolished, the trajectory seen in Scripture is a progressive liberation of slaves. When this is extended to modern times, it implies that the Biblical witness supports the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. The progressive [[Women's rights|liberation of women]] from oppressive patriarchalism, traced from Genesis and Exodus through to Paul's own acknowledgement of women as 'co-workers' ({{bibleref2|Romans|16:3|NLT|Rom. 16:3}}), sets a precedent that when applied to modern times suggests that women ought to have the same rights and roles afforded to men. Historically, the Biblical witness has become progressively more stringent in its views of homosexual practice and the implications of this are not commented upon by Webb.

The '''Chinese room argument''' holds that a program cannot give a computer a "[[mind]]", "[[intentionality|understanding]]" or "[[consciousness]]",{{efn|name=Consciousness}} regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was first presented by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his paper, "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} The centerpiece of the argument is a [[thought experiment]] known as the '''Chinese room'''.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]],{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}} which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls '''Strong AI''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount of intelligence a machine can display.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}}

==Chinese room thought experiment==
[[File:John searle2.jpg|thumb|John Searle in December 2005]]
Searle's [[thought experiment]] begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that [[artificial intelligence]] research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. It takes [[Chinese character]]s as input and, by following the instructions of a [[computer program]], produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the [[Turing test]]: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine ''literally'' "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely ''simulating'' the ability to understand Chinese?{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}{{efn|Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}} He also writes:  "On the Strong AI view, the appropriately programmed computer does not just simulate having a mind; it literally has a mind."{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=66}}}} Searle calls the first position "[[#Strong AI|strong AI]]" and the latter "weak AI".{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)" | 
Searle writes:  "Partisans of strong AI claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also (1) that the machine can literally be said to ''understand'' the story and provide the answers to questions, and (2) that what the machine and its program ''explains'' the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}
}}

Searle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. ("I don't speak a word of Chinese,"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}} he points out.)  Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.

Searle argues that, without "understanding" (or "[[intentionality]]"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as "thinking" and, since it does not think, it does not have a "mind" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that "strong AI" is false.

==History==
[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument in 1714 against [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a "mind" capable of "perception" could be constructed using only mechanical processes.{{efn|Note that Leibniz' was objecting to a "mechanical" theory of the mind (the philosophical position known as [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]].) Searle is objecting to an "information processing" view of the mind (the philosophical position known as "[[computationalism]]"). Searle accepts mechanism and rejects computationalism.}} In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the [[China brain]], also the "Chinese Nation" or the "Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It eventually became the journal's "most influential target article",{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that "the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Preston|Bishop|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. "The overwhelming majority", notes ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|BBS]]'' editor [[Stevan Harnad]],{{efn|[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]] edited ''BBS'' during the years which saw the introduction and popularisation of the Chinese Room argument.}} "still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong".{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired [[Patrick J. Hayes|Pat Hayes]] to comment that the field of [[cognitive science]] ought to be redefined as "the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harnad|2001|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle's argument has become "something of a classic in cognitive science", according to Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} [[Varol Akman]] agrees, and has described the original paper as "an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Varol Akman |last=Akman |first=Varol |year=1998 |title=Book Review — ''John Haugeland (editor), Mind Design II: Philosophy, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence'' [Journal (Paginated)] |url=http://cogprints.org/539/index.html |access-date=2018-10-02 |via=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers, philosophers have come to view it as an important part of the [[philosophy of mind]]. It is a challenge to [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and the [[computational theory of mind]],{{efn|name=Computationalism|[[Stevan Harnad]] holds that the Searle's argument is against the thesis that "has since come to be called 'computationalism,' according to which cognition is just computation, hence mental states are just computational states".{{sfn|Harnad|2005|p=1}} David Cole agrees that "the argument also has broad implications for functionalist and computational theories of meaning and of mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=1}}}} and is related to such questions as the [[mind–body problem]], the [[problem of other minds]], the [[symbol grounding|symbol-grounding]] problem, and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].{{efn|name=Consciousness}}

===Strong AI===&lt;!--This section title is linked to from several places --&gt;
[[John Searle|Searle]] identified a [[philosophical position]] he calls "strong AI":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name="Strong AI"|This version is from Searle's ''Mind, Language and Society''{{sfn|Searle|1999|p={{Page needed|date=February 2012}}}} and is also quoted in [[Daniel Dennett]]'s ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=435}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]]: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition hinges on the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''actually having'' a mind. Searle writes that "according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind."{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}}

The position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder [[Herbert A. Simon]] declared that "there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Simon, together with [[Allen Newell]] and [[Cliff Shaw]], had just completed the first "AI" program, the [[Logic Theorist]].}} and claimed that they had "solved the venerable [[mind–body problem]], explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of [[mind]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=46}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] wrote that "AI wants only the genuine article: ''machines with minds'', in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, ''computers ourselves''."{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=2|ps=(Italics his).}}

Searle also ascribes the following positions to advocates of strong AI:
* AI systems can be used to explain the mind;{{efn|name="Strong AI in Searle (1980)"}}
* The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the mind;{{efn|Searle believes that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} He writes elsewhere, "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} This position owes its phrasing to Stevan Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}}} and
* The [[Turing test]] is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states.{{efn|"One of the points at issue," writes Searle, "is the adequacy of the Turing test."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}}}

===Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism===
In more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified "strong AI" as "computer [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]" (a term he attributes to [[Daniel Dennett]]).{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=45}} Functionalism is a position in modern [[philosophy of mind]] that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.

[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as "recognizable tenets of ''computationalism'', a position (unlike "strong AI") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|loc=p. 3 (Italics his)}} [[Computationalism]]{{efn|[[Computationalism]] is associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],{{sfn|Horst|2005|p=1}} and is held by [[Allen Newell]],{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} [[Zenon Pylyshyn]]{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} and [[Steven Pinker]],{{sfn|Pinker|1997}} among others.}} is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the [[mind]] can be accurately described as an [[information processing|information-processing]] system.

Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a "tenet" of computationalism:{{sfn|Harnad|2001|pp=3–5}}
* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);
* Computational states are [[multiple realizability|implementation-independent]]—in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that
* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the [[Turing test]] is definitive.

===Strong AI vs. biological naturalism===

Searle holds a philosophical position he calls "[[biological naturalism]]": that [[consciousness]]{{efn|name=Consciousness}} and [[intentionality|understanding]] require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes "brains cause minds"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} and that "actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains".{{sfn|Searle|1990|p=29}} Searle argues that this machinery (known to [[neuroscience]] as the "[[neural correlates of consciousness]]") must have some (unspecified) "causal powers" that permit the human experience of consciousness.{{sfn|Searle|1990}} Searle's faith in the existence of these powers has been criticized.{{efn|See the replies to Searle under [[#Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness|Meaninglessness]], below}}

Searle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, "we are precisely such machines".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.

Biological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both [[behaviorism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] (including "computer functionalism" or "strong AI").{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} Biological naturalism is similar to [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] (the position that mental states are "identical to" or "composed of" neurological events);  however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory.{{sfn|Searle|1992|loc=chpt. 5}}{{efn|Larry Hauser writes that "biological naturalism is either confused (waffling between identity theory and dualism) or else it ''just is'' identity theory or dualism."{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}}}} Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to [[Cartesian dualism]],{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different "substances". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that "strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}

Searle's original presentation emphasized "understanding"—that is, mental states with what philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"—and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as "consciousness". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}
{{quote|Computational models of consciousness are not sufficient by themselves for consciousness. The computational model for consciousness stands to consciousness in the same way the computational model of anything stands to the domain being modelled. Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London will leave us all wet. But they make the mistake of supposing that the computational model of consciousness is somehow conscious. It is the same mistake in both cases.{{sfn|Searle|2002}}|John R. Searle| Consciousness and Language, p. 16}}
[[David Chalmers]] writes "it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter" of the Chinese room.{{sfn|Chalmers|1996|p=322}}

[[Colin McGinn]] argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.{{sfn|McGinn|2000}}

Searle argues that this is only true for an observer ''outside'' of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone ''inside'' the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.

===Applied ethics===

[[File:USS Vincennes (CG-49) Aegis large screen displays.jpg|thumb|right|Sitting in the [[Operations room|Combat Information Center]] aboard [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|a warship]] – proposed as a real-life analog to the Chinese Room]]

Patrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military [[command and control]] systems if they are to preserve a commander's [[moral agency]]. He drew an analogy between a commander in their [[Operations room|command center]] and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of [[Nicomachean Ethics|Aristotle’s notions of "compulsory" and "ignorance"]]. Information could be "down converted" from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the [[Iran Air Flight 655|USS ''Vincennes'' incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Preserving a combat commander's moral agency: The Vincennes Incident as a Chinese Room|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227–235 |doi=10.1007/s10676-016-9408-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
The Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the [[philosophy of mind]], and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including [[physical symbol system|symbol processing]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[Turing completeness]], and the [[Turing test]].

===Strong AI vs. AI research===
Searle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers "don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The primary mission of [[artificial intelligence]] research is only to create useful systems that ''act'' intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is "merely" a simulation.

Searle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that ''acts'' more intelligently than a person, but does not have a [[mind]] or [[intentionality]] in the same way that [[Human brain|brains]] do. The Chinese room argument is not a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', rather it is an example that requires explanation. 

Searle's "strong AI" should not be confused with "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" as defined by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and other futurists,{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the ''amount'' of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.

===Turing test===
{{main article|Turing test}}
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing Test, in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player – A or B – is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination. Image adapted from Saygin, 2000.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]
The Chinese room implements a version of the [[Turing test]].{{sfn|Turing|1950}} [[Alan Turing]] introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question "can machines think?" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Turing then considered each possible objection to the proposal "machines can think", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of "consciousness" or "understanding". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:
{{quote|I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.{{sfn|Turing|1950}}}}

To Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[consciousness]], these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can [[behaviourism|behave]] or [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] as a conscious mind would.

===Symbol processing===
{{Main article|Physical symbol system}}
The Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] called this kind of machine a [[physical symbol system]]. It is also equivalent to the [[formal system]]s used in the field of [[mathematical logic]].

Searle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is [[syntax|syntactic]] (borrowing a term from the study of [[grammar]]). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of [[syntax|syntax rules]], without any knowledge of the symbol's [[semantics]] (that is, their [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]).

Newell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for "general intelligent action", or, as it is known today, [[artificial general intelligence]]. They framed this as a philosophical position, the [[physical symbol system|physical symbol system hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."{{sfn|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}} The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of "intelligent action", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.

===Chinese room and Turing completeness===
{{See also|Turing completeness|Church–Turing thesis}}
The Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a [[Von Neumann architecture]], which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a [[central processing unit|CPU]] which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in [[theoretical computer science]] as "[[Turing complete]]", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a [[Turing machine]] can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. [[Alan Turing]] writes, "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=442}} The widely accepted [[Church–Turing thesis]] holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.

The Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to [[Stevan Harnad]], are "no refutation (but rather an affirmation)"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}} of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that ''no'' digital computers can have a mind.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}

There are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.{{sfn|Ben-Yami|1993}}

==Complete argument==
Searle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Searle|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The wording of each axiom and conclusion are from Searle's presentation in ''[[Scientific American]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1990}}{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=5}} (A1-3) and (C1) are described as 1,2,3 and 4 in David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=5}}}} The only part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.{{efn|Paul and Patricia Churchland write that the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to "shore up axiom 3".{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990|p=34}}}}

He begins with three axioms:
:(A1) "Programs are formal ([[syntax|syntactic]])."
::A program uses [[syntax]] to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the [[semantics]] of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.

:(A2) "Minds have mental contents ([[semantics]])."
::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.

:(A3) "Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics."
::This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.

Searle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:

:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.

This much of the argument is intended to show that [[artificial intelligence]] can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the [[computational theory of mind]] correct?{{efn|name=Computationalism}} He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:

:(A4) Brains cause minds.

Searle claims that we can derive "immediately" and "trivially"{{sfn|Searle|1990}} that:

:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it "causal powers". "Causal powers" is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have "equivalent causal powers". "Equivalent causal powers" is whatever ''else'' that could be used to make a mind.

And from this he derives the further conclusions:

:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
::This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, it follows that programs do not have "equivalent causal powers."

:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
::Since programs do not have "equivalent causal powers", "equivalent causal powers" produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.

==Replies==
Replies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:{{efn|David Cole combines the second and third categories, as well as the fourth and fifth.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=5–6}}}}
* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way
* Those which contend that Searle's argument is misleading
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.

===Systems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===
These replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, ''where'' is the "mind" that does? These replies address the key [[ontological]] issues of [[mind/body problem|mind vs. body]] and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of "the system reply".

;System reply:The basic version argues that it is the "whole system" that understands Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=5–6}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=6–7}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=439}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by  [[Ned Block]], [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=6}}}}  While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. "Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part" Searle explains.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.

Searle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the "system" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to "the conjunction of that person and bits of paper"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are "under the grip of an ideology;"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing "system", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.

Searle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either because now "the system" and "the man" both describe exactly the same object.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} 

Critics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head.{{who|date=March 2011}} If we assume a "mind" is a form of information processing, then the [[theory of computation]] can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for [[Universal Turing machine|universal programmability]] (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials ''independently'' from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything ''including'' the specific program).{{sfn|Yee|1993|p=44|footnote=2}} The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's.{{sfn|Yee|1993|pp=42–47}} However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.

More sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what "the system" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies,{{who|date=March 2011}} the "mind that speaks Chinese" could be such things as: the "software", a "program", a "running program", a simulation of the "neural correlates of consciousness", the "functional system", a "simulated mind", an "[[strong emergence|emergent]] property", or "a [[virtual artifact|virtual]] mind" ([[Marvin Minsky]]'s version of the systems reply, described below).

;Virtual mind reply:The term "[[virtual artifact|virtual]]" is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist "in" a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects "inside" computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all "virtual", except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argues, a computer may contain a "mind" that is virtual in the same sense as [[virtual machine]]s, [[virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[virtual reality]].{{efn|The virtual mind reply is held by [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=7–9}} The reply was introduced by [[Marvin Minsky]].{{sfn|Minsky|1980|p=440}}{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=7}}}}

:To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple "virtual minds," thus the "system" cannot be the "mind".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=8}}

Searle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: "No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=12}} Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. "When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't ''really'' a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter."{{sfn|Fearn|2007|p=47}} The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article [[synthetic intelligence]].)

These replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something ''besides'' the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that "strong AI" is false.{{efn|David Cole writes "From the intuition that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room operator, then the inference is unsound."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=21}}}}

However, the thought experiment is not intended to be a reduction ad absurdum, but rather an example that requires explanation. Searle is not asserting that the situation is impossible, but rather that it is difficult or impossible to explain how this system can have subjection conscious experience.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=63|quote="the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition."}} The system reply succeeds in showing that it is ''not impossible'' but fails to show how the system would have consciousness; the replies, by themselves, provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the [[hypothetical]] premise that it passes the [[Turing Test]]. As Searle writes "the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}

===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===
As far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless "squiggles." But if the Chinese room really "understands" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about [[intentionality]], [[symbol grounding]] and [[syntax]] vs. [[semantic]]s.

;Robot reply:Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a "[[causality|causal]] connection" between the symbols and things they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=9–11}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This position is held by [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Stevan Harnad]], [[Hans Moravec]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=9}}}} [[Hans Moravec]] comments: "If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| David Cole calls this the "externalist" account of meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}}}

:Searle's reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and ''does not know what the symbols mean.'' Searle writes "he doesn't ''see'' what comes into the robot's eyes."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} (See [[Mary's room]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Derived meaning: Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, ''is'' connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is "talking" to and through the programmers who designed the [[knowledge base]] in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates ''are already meaningful'', they're just not meaningful to ''him''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The derived meaning reply is associated with [[Daniel Dennett]] and others.}}

:Searle says that the symbols only have a "derived" meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.{{efn|Searle distinguishes between "intrinsic" intentionality and "derived" intentionality. "Intrinsic" intentionality is the kind that involves "conscious understanding" like you would have in a human mind. [[Daniel Dennett]] doesn't agree that there is a distinction. David Cole writes "derived intentionality is all there is, according to Dennett."{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=19}}}}

;Commonsense knowledge / contextualist reply:Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast "background" of [[commonsense knowledge]] encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a "[[contextualism|context]]" that would give the symbols their meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}{{efn|David Cole describes this as the "internalist" approach to meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}} Proponents of this position include [[Roger Schank]], [[Doug Lenat]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and (with reservations) [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes "The fact is that any program [that passed a Turing test] would have to be an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge." {{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

:Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has also criticized the idea that the "background" can be represented symbolically.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1979|loc="The [[epistemological]] assumption"}}

To each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are [[syntax|syntactic]] and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes "syntax is insufficient for semantics."{{sfn|Searle|1984}}{{efn|Searle also writes "Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them."{{sfn|Motzkin|Searle|1989|p=45}}}}

However, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean ''to Searle'', what is important is what they mean ''to the virtual mind.'' While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that [[roboticist]]s can supply.

===Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room===
These arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular ''kind'' of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (Note that the "robot" and "commonsense knowledge" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)

;Brain simulator reply:Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=7–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=3–4}}; {{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The brain simulation replay has been made by [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=12}}}} This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.

:Searle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain—its causal and intentional states. [[John Searle|Searle]] is adamant that "human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} Moreover, he argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.

Now where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the "neuron firings" in his imagination.{{sfn|Searle|1980}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Two variations on the brain simulator reply are:
:;[[China brain]]:What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=4}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Early versions of this argument were put forward in 1974 by [[Lawrence Davis]] and in 1978 by [[Ned Block]]. Block's version used walkie talkies and was called the "Chinese Gym". Paul and Patricia Churchland described this scenario as well.{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}}} It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.

:;Brain replacement scenario:In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=956–8}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=20}}; {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|An early version of the brain replacement scenario was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-70s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] in 1980. [[Hans Moravec]] presented a vivid version of it,{{sfn|Moravec|1988}} and it is now associated with [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s version of [[transhumanism]].}} Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of your external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely outside of your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] [Y]our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1992}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ship of Theseus]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Combination reply:This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=8–9}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Many mansions/Wait till next year reply:Better technology in the future will allow computers to understand.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Searle|2009}} uses the name "Wait 'Til Next Year Reply".}} Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. His argument is that a machine using a program to manipulate formally defined elements can not produce understanding. Searle's argument, if correct, rules out only this particular design. Searle agrees that there may be other designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.

These arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.

In the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned.{{efn|Searle writes that the robot reply "tacitly concedes that cognition is not solely a matter of formal symbol manipulation." {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} Stevan Harnad makes the same point, writing: "Now just as it is no refutation (but rather an affirmation) of the CRA to deny that [the Turing test] is a strong enough test, or to deny that a computer could ever pass it, it is merely special pleading to try to save computationalism by stipulating ad hoc (in the face of the CRA) that implementational details do matter after all, and that the computer's is the 'right' kind of implementation, whereas Searle's is the 'wrong' kind."{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}}}} The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room ''could'' pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a "mind". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as "strong AI", proving his argument.

The brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes "I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} If computation does not provide an ''explanation'' of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.

Other critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle's description is correct, but ''misleading.'' By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).

In fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to ''weaken'' our intuitions. [[Ned Block]]'s [[Blockhead argument]]{{sfn|Block|1981}} suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple [[lookup table]] of [[Production system (computer science)|rules]] of the form "if the user writes ''S'', reply with ''P'' and goto X". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or "[[refactored]]") into this form, even a brain simulation.{{efn|That is, any program running on a machine with a finite amount memory.}} In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a [[memory address]]—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what "strong AI" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be ''extremely'' specific.

Searle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being ''simulated'' by a simple step by step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: "I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}}

===Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition===
The following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.

Several critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. [[Ned Block]] writes "Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading "[[intuition pump]]"{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}} and writes "Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it."{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437–440}}

Some of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be "an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge", as [[Daniel Dennett]] explains.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}

;Speed and complexity replies:The speed at which human brains process information is (by some estimates) 100 billion operations per second.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=269}} Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=14–15}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–270}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Speed and complexity replies are made by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} Daniel Dennett points out the complexity of world knowledge.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}

An especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]. They propose this analogous thought experiment:

;Churchland's luminous room:"Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!"{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} The problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=12}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=270}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=45–46}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stevan Harnad]] is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes "Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a [[phase transition]] into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ''[[ad hoc]]'' speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=7}}{{efn|Critics of the "phase transition" form of this argument include Stevan Harnad, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} This "phase transition" idea is a version of [[strong emergentism]] (what [[Daniel Dennett]] derides as "Woo woo West Coast emergence"{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=275}}). Harnad accuses [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] of espousing strong emergentism. Ray Kurzweil also holds a form of strong emergentism.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}}}}

Searle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the "system reply" as remotely plausible, a person must be "under the grip of an ideology".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any "system" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.

===Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness===&lt;!-- Linked to in a footnote above --&gt;

Several replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that  human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question.  He writes that we must "presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=10}} These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not "exist" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.

;Other minds reply:This reply points out that Searle's argument is a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own [[Turing test]]). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=4–5}}; {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The "other minds" reply has been offered by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Hans Moravec]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}}}

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes "If a program behaves ''as if''  it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying.  For all I know, Searle may only be behaving ''as if''  he were thinking deeply about these matters.  But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought."{{sfn|Nilsson|1984}}

[[Alan Turing]] anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called "The Argument from Consciousness") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply.{{sfn|Turing|1950|pp=11–12}} He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that "instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=11}} The [[Turing test]] simply extends this "polite convention" to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.{{efn|One of Turing's motivations for devising the [[Turing test]] is to avoid precisely the kind of philosophical problems that Searle is interested in. He writes "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery ... [but] I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper." {{sfn|Turing|1950|p=12}} Although Turing is discussing consciousness (not the mind or understanding or intentionality), Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that Turing's comments apply the Chinese room.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=952–953}}}}

; Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as [[eliminative materialism]]: the view that consciousness is a property that can be reduced to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it, a "[[user illusion]]".{{sfn|Dennett|1991|loc={{page needed|date=February 2011}}}}

:[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is  [[epiphenomenal]]: that it "casts no shadow", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the "knowability of the mental", and in his belief that there are "causal properties" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the [[Turing test]]—the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's "causal properties" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}}

[[Daniel Dennett]] provides this extension to the "epiphenomena" argument.
;Dennett's reply from natural selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's "causal properties" but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a "[[philosophical zombie|zombie]]" in thought experiments in the [[philosophy of mind]]). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Harnad|2005|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that "the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers."{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.

;[[Newton's flaming laser sword]] reply: [[Mike Alder]] argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-[[positivist]]: not only is the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''having'' a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.{{sfn|Alder|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20808">'''Cognitive inhibition''' refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod| first = Colin| title = Concept of Inhibition in Cognition| year = 2007| url = http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~msommers/aging/inhibit0.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of [[cognitive science]].

==History==

The early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the [[Psychological repression|repression]] of experiences from infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=Dempster&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F.N.| title = Chapter 1: A Historical Perspective| journal = Interference and Inhibition in Cognition| year = 1995| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021992632168?LI=true#page-3| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1023/A:1021992632168| volume=11| pages=1–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

Other early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.

During the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in [[developmental psychology]], but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

==Developmental psychology==

Cognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in [[developmental psychology]].  An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; explained children's performance in the [[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief task]] as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of [[empathy]]: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation &lt;ref name=Harnishfeger&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harnishfeger| first = Katherine| title = The Development of Cognitive Inhibition| publisher = Academic Press, Inc.| location = San Diego, CA| year = 1995| url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lJ5ubLyVaGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=harnishfeger+memory+formation&amp;ots=i9OxRMNODo&amp;sig=kk-o4lud62_NJ7Vm5n7RTGSuia8#v=onepage&amp;q=harnishfeger%20memory%20formation&amp;f=false| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[memory inhibition]]. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davidson| first = Matthew|author2=Dima Amso |author3=Loren Cruess Anderson |author4=Adele Diamond | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching| journal = Neuropsychologia| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078| publisher = Neuropsychologia| year = 2006| pmc=1513793| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid=16580701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and [[cognitive ability]] on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.&lt;ref name=Harnishfeger /&gt;

==Role in survival==

Cognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called [[betrayal trauma theory]].&lt;ref name="Freyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Freyd|first = Jennifer|title = What is a Betrayal Trauma? What is Betrayal Trauma Theory?|journal = Encyclopedia of Psychological Trauma|pages = 76|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2008|url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/dynamic/jjf/defineBT.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness".&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal| last = Todd| first = Peter|author2=Ralph Hertwig |author3=Ulrich Hoffrage | title = Evolutionary Cognitive Psychology| journal = Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology| year = 2004| url = http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/pt/PT_Evolutionary_2005.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through [[evolution]]. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.

==Behavioral psychology==
[[Behavioral psychology]] may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.
Cognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships.&lt;ref name=Dempster2&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F|author2=A. Corkill| title = Neo-interference research and the development of intelligence| journal = The development of intelligence| pages = 215–243| publisher = Hove| year = 1999| jstor = 10.1086/650572| volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by [[empathy]], which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining [[social relationships]].

Behavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in [[behavioral psychology]], as is emotional control. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes".&lt;ref name=Joorman&gt;{{cite journal| last = Joorman| first = J |author2=K.L. Yoon |author3=U. Zetsche| title = Cognitive inhibition in depression| journal = Applied and Preventive Psychology| volume = 12| pages = 128–139| year = 2007| url = http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/jjoormann/| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1016/j.appsy.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, but it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robinson| first = Michael|author2=Benjamin M. Wilkowski |author3=Brian P. Meier |author4=Sara K. Moeller |author5=Adam K. Fetterman | title = Counting to ten milliseconds: Low-anger, but not high-anger, individuals pause following negative evaluations| journal = Cognition and Emotion| pages = 1–21| publisher = Psychology Press| year = 2011| url = http://public.gettysburg.edu/~bmeier/Publications/Robinson%20et%20al.%20(in%20press)%20-%20Counting%20to%20Ten.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi = 10.1080/02699931.2011.579088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.

==Behavioral neuroscience==

[[Behavioral neuroscience]] applies the principles of [[neurobiology]], to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior.   Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting [[biological]] factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]], or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. "[[GABA]], an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the [[cerebral cortex]] in substantial quantities".&lt;ref name=Dempster2 /&gt; Given the [[cerebral cortex]]'s importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. [[Serotonin]] and [[dopamine]], which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these [[neurotransmitters]] are capable of "blocking" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the [[central nervous system]] has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as [[lateral inhibition]], which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the [[neural]] background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level.

==Theory of inefficient inhibition==

Many contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool "of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information".&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt; This means that [[working memory]] and the various areas of the [[brain]] responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of "mental resources" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, "freeing up space" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild [[cognitive impairment]], this effect is especially pronounced in [[methamphetamine]]-dependent individuals.&lt;ref name=Salo&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salo | first = Ruth |author2=Thomas E. Nordahl |author3=Kate Possin |author4=Martin Leamon |author5=David R. Gibson |author6=Gantt P. Galloway |author7=Neil M. Flynn |author8=Avishai Henik |author9=Adolf Pfefferbaum |author10=Edith V. Sullivan  | title = Preliminary evidence of reduced cognitive inhibition in methamphetamine-dependent individuals | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 111 | pages = 65–74 | doi=10.1016/s0165-1781(02)00111-7  | year = 2002 | url = http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/salo_nordahl_etal_PR2002.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the [[psychoactive drug]], the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]], discussed in an earlier section.

==Failure and deficits==

If an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rosenberg | first = D.R. |author2=Dick, E.L. |author3=O'Hearn, K.M. |author4=Sweeney, J.A. | title = Response-inhibition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder; an indicator of dysfunction in frontostriatal circuits | journal = Psychiatry Neuroscience | volume = 22  | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that [[OCD]] patients made significantly more commission errors than matched [[panic]] disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli".&lt;ref name=Chamberlain&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chamberlain | first = S.R. |author2=A.D. Blackwell |author3=N.A. Fineberg |author4=T.W. Robbins |author5=B.J. Sahakin | title = The neuropsychology of obsessive compulsive disorder: the importance of failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibition as candidate endophenotypic markers | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 29 | pages = 399–419 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.006 | pmid=15820546 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. [[Suicidal behavior]] may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment.&lt;ref name=Devantoy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richard-Devantoy | first = S. |author2=F. Jollant |author3=Z. Kefi |author4=JP Olie |author5=C. Annweiler |author6=O. Beauchet |author7=D. Le Gall  | title = Deficit of cognitive inhibition in depressed elderly: a neurocognitive marker of suicidal risk | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–199 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2012 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032712001929 | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.006 | pmid=22464009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one [[meta-analysis]] involving 164 studies, it was discovered that [[executive dysfunction]] and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors.&lt;ref name=Devantoy /&gt; In [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent [[mind|mental]] representations.&lt;ref name=Engelhart&gt;{{cite journal | last = Engelhart | first = Paul E. |author2=[[Joel T. Nigg]] |author3=Laurie A. Carr |author4=Fernanda Ferreia  | title = Cognitive Inhibition and Working Memory in Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 591–605 | year = 2008 | url = http://libra.msra.cn/Publication/5486706/cognitive-inhibition-and-working-memory-in-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1037/a0012593 | pmid=18729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of [[working memory]] deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under ''inhibitory deficit theory'' as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target".&lt;ref name=Zacks&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zacks | first = R.T. |author2=L.

Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], or [[OCD]] indicate.

'''Critical Reconstruction''' is a [[theory]] of architecture and urbanism originally developed by the Berlin architect [[Josef Paul Kleihues]]. It was first applied in Berlin's [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|International Building Exhibition]] in the 1980s, and was subsequently used in the reconstruction of the city after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] under Senate Building Director [[Hans Stimmann]]. Critical Reconstruction encouraged a return to traditional (pre-World War II) architectural styles and typologies, and sought to recreate the pedestrian-centered urban street life of the early twentieth-century European metropolis through the restoration of the inner city’s original baroque-era street plan.

Post-wall Critical Reconstruction in Berlin was closely associated with an architectural approach called "New Simplicity," theorized by [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] and championed by architect [[Hans Kollhoff]].

Hans Stimmann also used Critical Reconstruction as the basis for his ''[[Planwerk Innenstadt]]'', an inner-city development plan for Berlin that favored the demolition of mid-century buildings and the infill of empty plots with higher-density, mixed-use structures.

Major examples of Critical Reconstruction in Berlin include [[Potsdamer Platz]], the Friedrichstadt Passagen, and [[Alexanderplatz]].

In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.&lt;ref&gt;Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.

The '''Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project''' ('''DDPP''') is a global consortium formed in October 2013 which researches methods to limit the rise of global temperature due to [[global warming]] to 2{{nnbsp}}°C or less.&lt;ref name="DDPPabout"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of the DDPP is on [[sustainable energy]] systems, other sectors of the economy, such as [[agriculture]] and [[Land use|land-use]], are not directly considered.

== Methods ==

Analyses of possible scenarios assume no major changes in culture and rely on existing technology. They assume no major changes in the lifestyles of people in developed countries and do not include possible future technologies such as [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion]]. Population growth of 1% per year and economic growth of 3% is assumed. Analyses show a need for continued research on energy technologies.&lt;ref name=NYT120115/&gt;

The DDPP rejects an incrementalist approach to climate protection.  Instead, meeting the [[climate change mitigation]] challenge (as set out in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]]) will require [[backcasting]] to a suitable attractor, such as complete decarbonization.  This method allows short-term policy options to be developed that are consistent with the selected long-term target.  Even so, there are numerous possible deep decarbonization pathways (DDP) for each country and stakeholders and policymakers will need to debate and choose one, building the necessary political consensus as they go.  DDPs can help avoid dead-end investments that reduce emissions in the short-term but obstruct deep decarbonization in the long-term and thereby reduce the risk of becoming [[stranded asset|stranded]].&lt;ref name="bataille-etal-2016"&gt;

In 2016, the project proposed a new conceptual decision framework for deep development pathways (DDP) analysis across its 16 participating countries.  This includes an agenda for the further development of modelling methodologies.  A key motivation is to address the "intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;

== Findings ==

DDPPs analyses show that meeting a goal of limiting the rise of global temperature due to 2{{nnbsp}}°C or less is barely possible using existing technology, if it were deployed, however long term plans are not in place to do so.&lt;ref name=NYT120115/&gt;

As of early 2016, the DDPP was composed of energy researchers and institutions across the following economies and covering 74% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, the UK and the US.  The 2015 global synthesis and country reports can be downloaded.&lt;ref name="ddpp-synthesis-reports"&gt;

'''District Regionalism''' is a finance-related [[urban planning]] method. The practice creates a neighborhood stock system in which community shares are sold. The term "District Regionalism" was initially used by the administration of the city of [[Guthrie, Kentucky]] as the distinctive traits of each neighborhood emerged during the trial study. The [[University of Kentucky]]'s College of Design became instrumental in devising the study concept, parameters and goals. The practice concerns organizing cities into smaller communities by allowing creating and distinctive regional and cultural references emerge within neighborhoods by allowing the public to transform what is typically considered as government owned areas and [[Blight (urban)|blighted]] properties. The practice has been proven to alter larger sprawling co-dependant cities into smaller self-reliant communities.

== Share System ==
Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments.{{clarify|date=October 2013}}  As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger amount of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within [[city ordinance]]s and [[zoning]].  As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges.  As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval.  The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:moderncityhall.jpg|thumb|right|View of downtown Guthrie, Kentucky showing the redesigned street scape {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

The study of [[ley line]]s originates in the 1920s with [[Alfred Watkins]]. The term "Earth mysteries" for this field of interest was coined about 1970 in ''The Ley Hunter'' journal,&lt;ref&gt;earlier use of the term "earth-mysteries" mostly refers to actual [[mystery religion|mysteries]] dedicated to [[chthonic]] deities in classical antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated concepts have been embraced and reinvented by movements such as the [[New Age Movement]] and [[neopaganism|modern paganism]] during the 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;

Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, [[Stonehenge]] is a popular destination among New Age seekers.&lt;ref name=hetherington&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Travellers: Vanloads of Uproarious Humanity |first=Kevin |last=Hetherington |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=143|year=2000|isbn=0304339784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdonald &gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Museums: Representing Identity and Diversity in a Changing World|first=Sharon |last=Macdonald|author2=Gordon Fyfe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0631201513|pages=156,164–6,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th-century [[antiquarians]]: [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]], who both believed that [[Stonehenge]] was associated with the [[druids]]. Stukeley mixed together ancient [[monuments]] and [[mythology]] towards an "idealized vision" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxL0TcO2GI618QOhnNyPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;f=false|title=The Cultures of Celebrations|first1=Ray Broadus|last1=Browne|first2=Michael T.|last2=Marsden|date=31 December 1994|publisher=Popular Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ley lines" were postulated by  [[Alfred Watkins]] in 1921 at a presentation at the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]], later published in ''Early British Trackways'' (1922) and ''The Old Straight Track'' (1925). Watkins formed the ''Old Straight Track Club'' in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period.{{Citation needed|reason=Mention of organization becoming defunct, but no date or source are provided|date=February 2017}}

A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with [[neopagan]] currents like [[Wicca]], and with [[ufology]]. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by [[Philip Heselton]] and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal ''The Ley Hunter'' was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled "the Magazine of Earth Mysteries".{{Citation needed|reason=Reference to a journal and its content, without sources or external links|date=February 2017}}

British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called ''The Sphinx and the Megaliths'' in which he linked the Egyptian [[Sphinx]] to the British [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith|megalithic structures]] claiming they were all built by a group of "elite trained" people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ex3FSCaY_4C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SiH1TaCLO5C38QO8q5yzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=29 August 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Age boom]] of the 1980s expanded the scope of the "Earth mysteries" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a "New Age invented tradition" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including [[archaeology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], and [[ley lines]]), Chinese [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], western magical concepts of [[gematria]], and [[dowsing]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=1053-4202&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=4&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=237261&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False| journal=Anthropology of Consciousness |volume= 6| issue = 4. |date=December 1995 |pages=31–45|title=Inventing Traditions for the New Age: A Case Study of the Earth Energy Tradition |author=JEFFERY L. MACDONALD|doi=10.1525/ac.1995.6.4.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]. Michell's book ''The View Over Atlantis'' mixed [[ley lines]] with [[folklore]] and [[archeology]]; these ideas became popularised as "earth mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 {{ISBN|0954296346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include [[Paul Devereux]] and [[Nigel Pennick]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 {{ISBN|9780892810918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include the "[[landscape archaeology]]" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of "[[Forteana]]", a term taken to include [[paranormal]] phenomena more generally.{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion of connection to [[Forteana]], which makes no references to either archaelogy or paranormal locations. |date=February 2017}}

==Publication history==

Books on Earth mysteries first appeared in the 1970s, discussing topics such as [[ley lines]], [[earth energy|earth energies]], [[astro-archaeology]], [[Sacred natural site|sacred landscapes]], [[megalithic monuments]], [[shamanism]], [[paganism]], [[dowsing]] and [[folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Moorey, Earth Mysteries: A Beginner's Guide, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daren Kemp, James R. Lewis, Handbook of New Age, 2007, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be "[[sacred]]" and "[[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoeic]]" rather than scientific.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by "professional debunkers" such as [[James Randi]], [[Martin Gardner]], and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]]).&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term "ritual landscapes" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to "sacred" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.&lt;ref name= Robb&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'ritual landscape' concept in archaeology: a heritage construction| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769326307~db=all |author=John G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5405">'''Environmental biotechnology''' is [[biotechnology]] that is applied to and used to study the [[natural environment]].  Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation.  The [http://www3.inecol.edu.mx/iseb/ International Society for Environmental Biotechnology] defines environmental biotechnology as "the development, use and regulation of biological systems for remediation of contaminated environments ([[landform|land]], [[air]], [[water]]), and for [[natural environment|environment]]-friendly processes (green manufacturing technologies and [[sustainable development]])".&lt;ref&gt;Gerben J Zylstraa and Jerome J Kukor, ''What is environmental biotechnology?'' Current Opinion in Biotechnology 16(3):243-245, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental biotechnology can simply be described as "the optimal use of nature, in the form of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[algae]], to produce [[renewable energy]], [[food]] and [[nutrients]] in a [[synergistic]] integrated cycle of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process".&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Sagar. K, ''National Conference on Environmental Biotechnology'', Bangalore 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance towards agriculture, food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation and the MDGs==

[[Science]] through the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development|IAASTD]] has called for the advancement of small-scale agro-ecological farming systems and technology in order to achieve food security, [[climate change mitigation]], [[climate change adaptation]] and the realisation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Environmental biotechnology has been shown to play a significant role in [[agroecology]] in the form of [[zero waste agriculture]] and most significantly through the operation of over 15 million [[biogas digester]]s worldwide.

==Significance towards industrial biotechnology==

Consider an environment in which pollution of a particular type is maximum. Let us consider the effluents of a starch industry  which has mixed up with a local water body like a lake or pond.  We find huge deposits of starch which are not so easily taken up for degradation by micro-organisms except for a few exemptions.  we isolate a few micro-organisms from the polluted site and scan for any significant changes in their genome like mutations or evolutions.  The modified genes are then identified.  This is done because, the isolate would have adapted itself to degrade/utilize the starch better than other microbes of the same genus.  Thus, the resultant genes are cloned onto industrially significant micro-organisms and are used for more economically significant processes like in pharmaceutical industry, fermentations...etc.

Similar situations can be elucitated like in the case of oil spills in the oceans which require cleanup, microbes isolated from oil rich environments like oil wells, oil transfer pipelines...etc. have been found having the potential to degrade oil or use it as an energy source.  Thus they serve as a remedy to oil spills.

Still another elucidation would be in the case of microbes isolated from pesticide rich soils These would be capable of utilizing the pesticides as energy source and hence when mixed along with bio-fertilizers, would serve as excellent insurance against increased pesticide-toxicity levels in agricultural platform.

But the counter argument would be that whether these newly introduced microorganisms would create an imbalance in the environment concerned.The mutual harmony in which the organisms in that particular environment existed may have to face alteration and we should be extremely careful so as to not disturb the mutual relationships already existing in the environment of both the benefits and the disadvantages would pave way for an improvised version of environmental biotechnology. After all it is the environment that we strive to protect.

==Applications and Implications==

Humans have been manipulating genetic material for centuries. Although many benefits are provided by these manipulations, there can also be unexpected, negative health and environmental outcomes. Environmental biotechnology, then, is all about the balance between the applications that provide for these and the implications of manipulating genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel A. Vallero]], ''Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach'', Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; {{ISBN|978-0-12-375089-1}}; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Textbooks address both the applications and implications. Environmental engineering texts addressing [[sewage treatment]] and biological principles are often now considered to be environmental biotechnology texts. These generally address the applications of biotechnologies, whereas the implications of these technologies are less often addressed; usually in books concerned with potential impacts and even catastrophic events.

It has commanding  views down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. There is an ample supply of spring water and enough land for a plentiful food supply.

'''Environmental history''' is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa.

Environmental history emerged in the United States out of the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacEachern|Turkel|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or [[sustainability|sustainable development]]. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science.

The subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, nature itself and its change over time, includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth's [[landform|land]], [[water]], [[atmosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. The second category, how humans use nature, includes the environmental consequences of increasing [[population]], more effective [[technology]] and changing patterns of [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the [[neolithic revolution]], the effects of [[colonial expansion]] and [[Human settlement|settlements]], and the environmental and human consequences of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]]s.&lt;ref name=Grove4&gt;See {{Harvnb|Grove|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, environmental historians study how people think about nature - the way [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[belief]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s influence interaction with nature, especially in the form of [[myth]]s, [[religion]] and [[science]].

==Origin of name and early works==
{{Main|Roderick Nash}}
In 1967 [[Roderick Nash]] published "''Wilderness and the American Mind''", a work that has become a classic text of early environmental history. In an address to the ''Organization of American Historians'' in 1969 (published in 1970) Nash used the expression "environmental history",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Nash|1970|pp=249–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; although 1972 is generally taken as the date when the term was first coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nash|1972|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1959 book by [[Samuel P. Hays]], ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'', while being a major contribution to American political history, is now also regarded as a founding document in the field of environmental history.  Hays is Professor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023137/http://www.historyforthefuture.org/wordpress/?p=46 Samuel P. Hays on National Forests and Ecology], ''History for the Future'', [[WRCT]], Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Brief overviews of the [[historiography]] of environmental history have been given by [[J. R. McNeill]],&lt;ref name=McNeill3 /&gt; [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|White|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Donald Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Hughes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Oxford University Press]] published a volume of 25 essays called ''The Oxford Handbook of Environmental History''.

===Definition===
There is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity has influenced its current condition, as well as commenting on the problems and opportunities of tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Worster]]'s widely quoted 1988 definition states that environmental history is the "interaction between human cultures and the environment in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, J. Donald Hughes defined the subject as the “study of human relationships through time with the natural communities of which they are a part in order to explain the processes of change that affect that relationship”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2006, as "history that seeks understanding of human beings as they have lived, worked and thought in relationship to the rest of nature through the changes brought by time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a method, environmental history is the use of ecological analysis as a means of understanding human history...an account of changes in human societies as they relate to changes in the natural environment”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; Environmental historians are also interested in "what people think about nature, and how they have expressed those ideas in folk religions, popular culture, literature and art”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; In 2003, [[J. R. McNeill]] defined it as "the history of the mutual relations between humankind and the rest of nature".&lt;ref name=McNeill3&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2003|pp=5–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject matter===
Traditional [[history|historical analysis]] has over time extended its range of study from the activities and influence of a few significant people to a much broader social, political, economic, and cultural analysis. Environmental history further broadens the subject matter of conventional history. In 1988, Donald Worster stated that environmental history “attempts to make history more inclusive in its narratives”&lt;ref name=Worster290&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; by examining the “''role and place of nature in human life''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, that “Environmental history explores the ways in which the biophysical world has influenced the course of human history and the ways in which people have thought about and tried to transform their surroundings''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependency of human and environmental factors in the creation of landscapes is expressed through the notion of the [[cultural landscape]]. Worster also questioned the scope of the discipline, asking: "''We study humans and nature; therefore can anything human or natural be outside our enquiry?''"&lt;ref name="Worster1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history is generally treated as a subfield of [[history]]. But some environmental historians challenge this assumption, arguing that while traditional history is human history – the story of people and their institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "humans cannot place themselves outside the principles of nature".&lt;ref name=hughes8&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, they argue that environmental history is a version of human history within a larger context, one less dependent on [[anthropocentrism]] (even though [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change is at the center of its narrative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dimensions====
[[File:Penn oil 1864.jpg|thumb|General view of Funkville in 1864, Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, USA]]
J. Donald Hughes responded to the view that environmental history is "''light on theory''" or lacking theoretical structure by viewing the subject through the lens of three "dimensions": nature and culture, history and science, and scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advances beyond Worster's recognition of three broad clusters of issues to be addressed by environmental historians although both historians recognize that the emphasis of their categories might vary according to the particular study&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, clearly, some studies will concentrate more on society and human affairs and others more on the environment.

====Themes====
Several themes are used to express these historical dimensions. A more traditional historical approach is to analyse the transformation of the globe’s ecology through themes like the separation of man from nature during the [[neolithic revolution]], [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]], [[exploration]], [[history of agriculture|agricultural change]], the effects of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]], and [[urban expansion]]. More environmental topics include human impact through influences on [[forestry]], [[fire]], [[climate change]], [[sustainability]] and so on. According to [[Paul Warde]], “''the increasingly sophisticated history of colonization and migration can take on an environmental aspect, tracing the pathways of ideas and species around the globe and indeed is bringing about an increased use of such analogies and ‘colonial’ understandings of processes within European history.''”&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the colonial enterprise in Africa, the Caribbean and Indian Ocean has been detailed by [[Richard Grove]].&lt;ref name=Grove4 /&gt; 
Much of the literature consists of case-studies targeted at the global, national and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scale====
Although environmental history can cover billions of years of history over the whole Earth, it can equally concern itself with local scales and brief time periods.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Krech|McNeill|Merchant|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental historians are occupied with local, regional and national histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians link their subject exclusively to the span of human history – "''every time period in human history''"&lt;ref name=hughes8 /&gt; while others include the period before human presence on Earth as a legitimate part of the discipline. [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]]'s ''Environmental History of Great Britain'' covers a period of about 10,000 years. There is a tendency to difference in time scales between natural and social phenomena: the causes of environmental change that stretch back in time may be dealt with socially over a comparatively brief period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at all times environmental influences have extended beyond particular geographic regions and cultures, during the 20th and early 21st centuries anthropogenic environmental change has assumed global proportions, most prominently with climate change but also as a result of settlement, the spread of disease and the globalization of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|left|Nature preservationist [[John Muir]] with U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (left) on [[Glacier Point]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]]]

The questions of environmental history date back to antiquity, including &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=18–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]], the father of medicine, who asserted that different cultures and human temperaments could be related to the surroundings in which peoples lived in ''Airs, Waters, Places''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars as varied as [[Ibn Khaldun]] and [[Montesquieu]] found climate to be a key determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name="eolss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=J. R.|title=The Historiography of Environmental History|journal=World Environmental History|url=https://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/C09/E6-156-01-00.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a rising awareness of the environment and scientists addressed themes of sustainability via natural history and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800|date=2008 |publisher=Ashgate| url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the origins of the subject in its present form are generally traced to the 20th century.

In 1929 a group of French historians founded the journal ''Annales'', in many ways a forerunner of modern environmental history since it took as its subject matter the reciprocal global influences of the environment and human society. The idea of the impact of the physical environment on civilizations was espoused by this [[Annales School]] to describe the long term developments that shape human history&lt;ref name="Worster1988" /&gt; by focusing away from political and intellectual history, toward [[agriculture]], [[demography]], and [[geography]]. [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], a pupil of the Annales School, was the first to really embrace, in the 1950s, environmental history in a more contemporary form.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|McNeill|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential members of the Annales School was [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), whose book ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' is now a classic in the field.

The most influential empirical and theoretical work in the subject has been done in the United States where teaching programs first emerged and a generation of trained environmental historians is now active.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt; In the United States environmental history as an independent field of study emerged in the general cultural reassessment and reform of the 1960s and 1970s along with environmentalism, "conservation history",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/hisnps/NPSThinking/nps-oah.htm Adam Rome "Conservation, Preservation, and Environmental Activism: A Survey  of the Historical Literature"]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and a gathering awareness of the global scale of some environmental issues. This was in large part a reaction to the way nature was represented in history at the time, which “portrayed the advance of culture and technology as releasing humans from dependence on the natural world and providing them with the means to manage it [and] celebrated human mastery over other forms of life and the natural environment, and expected technological improvement and economic growth to accelerate”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental historians intended to develop a post-colonial historiography that was "''more inclusive in its narratives''".&lt;ref name=Worster290 /&gt;

===Moral and political inspiration===
Moral and political inspiration to environmental historians has come from  American writers and activists such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[Rachel Carson]]. Environmental history "frequently promoted a moral and political agenda although it steadily became a more scholarly enterprise".&lt;ref name="Worster290"/&gt; Early attempts to define the field were made in the United States by [[Roderick Nash]] in “The State of Environmental History” and in other works by frontier historians [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], [[James Malin]], and [[Walter Prescott Webb]], who analyzed the process of settlement. Their work was expanded by a second generation of more specialized environmental historians such as [[Alfred Crosby]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], [[Donald Worster]], [[William Cronon]], [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[J. R. McNeill]], [[Donald Hughes]], and Chad Montrie in the United States and [[Paul Warde]], [[Sverker Sorlin]], [[Robert A. Lambert]], [[T.C. Smout]], and Peter Coates in Europe.

===British Empire===
Although environmental history was growing rapidly after 1970, it only reached [[Historiography of the British Empire|historians of the British Empire]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Winks, ed.|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68w-855pL-MC|year=1999|pages=664–65|isbn=9780191647697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav  Gadgil and Ramachandra  Guha, ''This fissured land: an ecological history of India'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. MacKenzie, ''The empire of nature: Hunting, conservation and British Imperialism'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Barton argues that the concept of environmentalism emerged from forestry studies, and emphasizes the British imperial role in that research.  He argues that imperial forestry movement in India around 1900 included government reservations, new methods of fire protection, and attention to revenue-producing forest management. The result eased the fight between romantic preservationists and laissez-faire businessmen, thus giving the compromise from which modern environmentalism emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Barton, "Empire forestry and the origins of environmentalism." ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 27#4 (2001): 529-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years numerous scholars cited by James Beattie have examined the environmental impact of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, "Recent Themes in the Environmental History of the British Empire," ''History Compass'' (Feb 2012) 10#2 pp 129-139&lt;/ref&gt;   Beinart and Hughes argue that the discovery and commercial or scientific use of new plants was an important concern in the 18th and 19th centuries. The efficient use of rivers through dams and irrigation projects was an expensive but important method of raising agricultural productivity. Searching for more efficient ways of using natural resources, the British moved flora, fauna and commodities around the world, sometimes resulting in ecological disruption and radical environmental change. Imperialism also stimulated more modern attitudes toward nature and subsidized botany and agricultural research.&lt;ref&gt;William Beinart  and Lotte Hughes. ''Environment and empire'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have used the British Empire to examine the utility of the new concept of eco-cultural networks as a lens for examining interconnected, wide-ranging social and environmental processes.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, Edward Melillo, and Emily O'Gorman. "Rethinking the British Empire through eco-cultural networks: materialist-cultural environmental history, relational connections and agency." ''Environment and History'' 20#4 (2014): 561-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practice==
[[File:Frederick Jackson Turner.jpg|thumb|Frontier historian &lt;br&gt;[[Frederick Jackson Turner]] (1861–1932)]]

In the United States the [[American Society for Environmental History]] was founded in 1975 while the first institute devoted specifically to environmental history in Europe was established in 1991, based at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1986, the Dutch foundation for the history of environment and hygiene ''[[Net Werk]]'' was founded and publishes four newsletters per year. In the UK the [[White Horse Press]] in Cambridge has, since 1995, published the journal ''[[Environment and History]]'' which aims to bring scholars in the humanities and biological sciences closer together in constructing long and well-founded perspectives on present day environmental problems and a similar publication ''[[Tijdschrift voor Ecologische Geschiedenis]]'' (''Journal for Environmental History'') is a combined Flemish-Dutch initiative mainly dealing with topics in the Netherlands and Belgium although it also has an interest in European environmental history. Each issue contains abstracts in English, French and German. In 1999 the Journal was converted into a yearbook for environmental history. In Canada the [[Network in Canadian History and Environment]] facilitates the growth of environmental history through numerous workshops and a significant digital infrastructure including their website and podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NiCHE Website|url=http://niche-canada.org|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between European nations is restricted by language difficulties. In April 1999 a meeting was held in Germany to overcome these problems and to co-ordinate environmental history in Europe. This meeting resulted in the creation of the [[European Society for Environmental History]] in 1999. Only two years after its establishment, ESEH held its first international conference in St. Andrews, Scotland. Around 120 scholars attended the meeting and 105 papers were presented on topics covering the whole spectrum of environmental history. The conference showed that environmental history is a viable and lively field in Europe and since then ESEH has expanded to over 400 members and continues to grow and attracted international conferences in 2003 and 2005. In 1999 the ''Centre for Environmental History'' was established at the University of Stirling. Some history departments at European universities are now offering introductory courses in environmental history and postgraduate courses in Environmental history have been established at the Universities of Nottingham, Stirling and Dundee and more recently a Graduierten Kolleg was created at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eh-resources.org/environmental_history.html What is Environmental History? K. Jan Oosthoek]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society]] (RCC), an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, was founded as a joint initiative of Munich's [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] and the [[Deutsches Museum]], with the generous support of the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCC Website|url=http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/index.html|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environment &amp; Society Portal (environmentandsociety.org) is the Rachel Carson Center's open access digital archive and publication platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment &amp; Society Portal Website|url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history prides itself in bridging the gap between the arts and natural sciences although to date the scales weigh on the side of science. A definitive list of related subjects would be lengthy indeed and singling out those for special mention a difficult task. However, those frequently quoted include, [[historical geography]], the [[history and philosophy of science]], [[history of technology]] and [[climate science]]. On the biological side there is, above all, [[ecology]] and [[historical ecology]], but also [[forestry]] and especially [[Forestry#History|forest history]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. When the subject engages in environmental advocacy it has much in common with [[environmentalism]].

With increasing globalization and the impact of global trade on resource distribution, concern over never-ending economic growth and the many human inequities environmental history is now gaining allies in the fields of  [[ecological economics|ecological]] and [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005|pp=30–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martinez-Alier|Schandle|2002|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engagement with sociological thinkers and the humanities is limited but cannot be ignored through the beliefs and ideas that guide human action. This has been seen as the reason for a perceived lack of support from traditional historians.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt;

==Issues==
The subject has a number of areas of lively debate. These include discussion concerning: what subject matter is most appropriate; whether environmental advocacy can detract from scholarly objectivity; standards of professionalism in a subject where much outstanding work has been done by non-historians; the relative contribution of nature and humans in determining the passage of history; the degree of connection with, and acceptance by, other disciplines - but especially mainstream history. For Paul Warde the sheer scale, scope and diffuseness of the environmental history endeavour calls for an analytical toolkit "a range of common issues and questions to push forward collectively" and a "core problem". He sees a lack of "human agency" in its texts and suggest it be written more to act: as a source of information for environmental scientists; incorporation of the notion of risk; a closer analysis of what it is we mean by "environment"; confronting the way environmental history is at odds with the humanities because it emphasises the division between "materialist, and cultural or constructivist explanations for human behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007|pp=107–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global sustainability===
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|alt=Two views of the Earth from space.|Achieving sustainability will enable the Earth to continue supporting human life as we know it. [[The Blue Marble|Blue Marble]] NASA composite images: 2001 (left), 2002 (right)]]
{{Main|Sustainability}}
Many of the themes of environmental history inevitably examine the circumstances that produced the environmental problems of the present day, a litany of themes that challenge global sustainability including: [[population]], [[consumerism]] and [[materialism]], [[climate change]], [[waste disposal]], [[deforestation]] and loss of wilderness, [[industrial agriculture]], [[species extinction]], depletion of natural resources, [[introduced species|invasive organisms]] and [[urban development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple message of sustainable use of renewable resources is frequently repeated and early as 1864 [[George Perkins Marsh]] was pointing out that the changes we make in the environment may later reduce the environments usefulness to humans so any changes should be made with great care&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Marsh|1864|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - what we would nowadays call [[enlightened self-interest]]. Richard Grove has pointed out that "''States will act to prevent environmental degradation only when their economic interests are threatened''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grove|1992|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
{{Main |Advocacy}}
It is not clear whether environmental history should promote a moral or political agenda. The strong emotions raised by environmentalism, conservation and sustainability can interfere with historical objectivity: polemical tracts and strong advocacy can compromise objectivity and professionalism. Engagement with the political process certainly has its academic perils&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1983|pp=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although accuracy and commitment to the historical method is not necessarily threatened by environmental involvement: environmental historians have a reasonable expectation that their work will inform policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Worster|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent historiographical shift has placed an increased emphasis on inequality as an element of environmental history. Imbalances of power in resources, industry, and politics have resulted in the burden of industrial pollution being shifted to less powerful populations in both the geographic and social spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Andrew |title=Environmental Inequalities:Class, Race, and Industrial Pollution in Gary, Indiana, 1945-1980 |date=1995 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |isbn=0807845183}}&lt;/ref&gt; An critical examination of the traditional environmentalist movement from this historical perspective notes the ways in which early advocates of environmentalism sought the aesthetic preservation of middle-class spaces and sheltered their own communities from the worst effects of air and water pollution, while neglecting the plight of the less privileged. 

Communities with less economic and sociopolitical power often lack the resources to get involved in environmental advocacy. Environmental history increasingly highlights the ways in which the middle-class environmental movement has fallen short and left behind entire communities. Interdisciplinary research now understands historic inequality as a lens through which to predict future social developments in the environmental sphere, particularly with regard to [[climate change]]. The [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] cautions that a warming planet will exacerbate environmental and other inequalities, particularly with regard to: "(a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Islam |first1=S. Nazrul |title=Climate Change and Social Inequality |url=http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2017/wp152_2017.pdf |website=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an interdisciplinary field that encompasses a new understanding of social justice dynamics in a rapidly changing global climate, environmental history is inherently advocative.

===Declensionist narratives===
Narratives of environmental history tend to be declensionist, that is, accounts of progressive decline under human activity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Presentism and culpability===
{{Main| Presentism (literary and historical analysis)}}
Under the accusation of "presentism" it is sometimes claimed that, with its genesis in the late 20th century environmentalism and conservation issues, environmental history is simply a reaction to contemporary problems, an "attempt to read late twentieth century developments and concerns back into past historical periods in which they were not operative, and certainly not conscious to human participants during those times".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is strongly related to the idea of culpability. In environmental debate blame can always be apportioned, but it is more constructive for the future to understand the values and imperatives of the period under discussion so that causes are determined and the context explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental determinism===

For some environmental historians "the general conditions of the environment, the scale and arrangement of land and sea, the availability of resources, and the presence or absence of animals available for domestication, and associated organisms and disease vectors, that makes the development of human cultures possible and even predispose the direction of their development"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "history is inevitably guided by forces that are not of human origin or subject to human choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been attributed to American environmental historians Webb and Turner&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently to [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', where the presence or absence of disease vectors and resources such as plants and animals that are amenable to domestication that may not only stimulate the development of human culture but even determine, to some extent, the direction of that development. The claim that the path of history has been forged by environmental rather than cultural forces is referred to as [[environmental determinism]] while, at the other extreme, is what may be called [[cultural determinism]]. An example of cultural determinism would be the view that human influence is so pervasive that the idea of pristine nature has little validity - that there is no way of relating to nature without culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Cronon|1995|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:HistoricalMarkerUSGeorgiaPioneerTurpentiningExperiment.jpg|thumb|Recording historical events]]
Useful guidance on the process of doing environmental history has been given by Donald Worster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Merchant|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Cronon&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronon|1993|pp=1347–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Simmons|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worster's three core subject areas (the environment itself, human impacts on the environment, and human thought about the environment) are generally taken as a starting point for the student as they encompass many of the different skills required. The tools are those of both history and science with a requirement for fluency in the language of natural science and especially ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact methodologies and insights from a range of physical and social sciences is required, there seeming to be universal agreement that environmental history is indeed a multidisciplinary subject.

==Future==
[[File:Eolienne et centrale thermique Nuon Sloterdijk.jpg|thumb|Old and new human uses of the atmosphere]]

Environmental history, like all historical studies, shares the hope that through an examination of past events it may be possible to forge a more considered future. In particular a greater depth of historical knowledge can inform environmental controversies and guide policy decisions.

The subject continues to provide new perspectives, offering cooperation between scholars with different disciplinary backgrounds and providing an improved historical context to resource and environmental problems. There seems little doubt that, with increasing concern for our environmental future, environmental history will continue along the path of environmental advocacy from which it originated as “''human impact on the living systems of the planet bring us no closer to utopia, but instead to a crisis of survival''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; with key themes being population growth, climate change, conflict over environmental policy at different levels of human organization, extinction, biological invasions, the environmental consequences of technology especially biotechnology, the reduced supply of resources - most notably energy, materials and water. Hughes comments that environmental historians “''will find themselves increasingly challenged by the need to explain the background of the world market economy and its effects on the global environment. Supranational instrumentalities threaten to overpower conservation in a drive for what is called sustainable development, but which in fact envisions no limits to economic growth''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes also notes that "''environmental history is notably absent from nations that most adamantly reject US, or Western influences''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bess sees the world increasingly permeated by potent technologies in a process he calls “artificialization” which has been accelerating since the 1700s, but at a greatly accelerated rate after 1945. Over the next fifty years, this transformative process stands a good chance of turning our physical world, and our society, upside-down. Environmental historians can “''play a vital role in helping humankind to understand the gale-force of artifice that we have unleashed on our planet and on ourselves''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this background “''environmental history can give an essential perspective, offering knowledge of the historical process that led to the present situation, give examples of past problems and solutions, and an analysis of the historical forces that must be dealt with''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as expressed by William Cronon, "''The viability and success of new human modes of existing within the constraints of the environment and its resources requires both an understanding of the past and an articulation of a new ethic for the future''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5474508 |title=See Cronon quote here |publisher=Searchworks.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''geothermal heat pump''' or '''ground source heat pump''' (GSHP) is a [[central heating]] and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground.

It uses the earth all the time, without any [[intermittent energy source|intermittency]], as a heat source (in the winter) or a [[heat sink]] (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and may be combined with [[solar heating]] to form a [[geosolar]] system with even greater efficiency. They are also known by other names, including '''geoexchange, earth-coupled, earth energy''' systems. The engineering and scientific communities prefer the terms "''geoexchange''" or "''ground source heat pumps''" to avoid confusion with traditional [[geothermal power]], which uses a high temperature heat source to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt; Ground source heat pumps harvest heat absorbed at the Earth's surface from solar energy. The temperature in the ground below {{convert|6|m}} is roughly equal to the mean annual air temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/Mean_Annual_Air_Temperature.html|title=Mean Annual Air Temperature – MATT – Ground temperature – Renewable Energy – Interseasonal Heat Transfer – Solar Thermal Collectors – Ground Source Heat Pumps – Renewable Cooling|author=|date=|website=www.icax.co.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that latitude at the surface.

Depending on latitude, the temperature beneath the upper {{convert|6|m}} of Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16&amp;nbsp;°C (50 and 60&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Geothermal Basics |publisher=US Department of Energy |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a [[heat pump]] to force the transfer of heat from the ground. Heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space, against the natural direction of flow, or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one. The core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle that moves heat. [[Air-source heat pumps]] are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters, even when extracting heat from cold winter air, although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5&amp;nbsp;°C (41&amp;nbsp;°F). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} A ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground. This is much more energy-efficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year.

Accessed: October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[thermal inertia]]. Like a [[cave]], the shallow ground temperature is warmer than the air above during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. A ground source heat pump extracts ground heat in the winter (for heating) and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer (for cooling). Some systems are designed to operate in one mode only, heating or cooling, depending on climate.

Geothermal pump systems reach fairly high [[coefficient of performance]] (CoP), 3 to 6, on the coldest of winter nights, compared to 1.75–2.5 for air-source heat pumps on cool days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12640 |title=Energy Savers: Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are among the most energy-efficient technologies for providing [[HVAC]] and [[water heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/projects/projects.cfm/ProjectID=108 |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tennessee Energy Efficient Schools Initiative Ground Source Heat Pumps |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528045631/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/projects/projects.cfm/ProjectID%3D108 |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cres-energy.org/techbasics/geothermal_div1.html |title=COLORADO RENEWABLE ENERGY SOCIETY – Geothermal Energy |publisher=Cres-energy.org |date=2001-10-25 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140006/http://www.cres-energy.org/techbasics/geothermal_div1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Setup costs are higher than for conventional systems, but the difference is usually returned in energy savings in 3 to 10 years, and even shorter lengths of time with federal, state and utility tax credits and incentives. Geothermal heat pump systems are reasonably warranted by manufacturers, and their working life is estimated at 25 years for inside components and 50+ years for the ground loop.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12640 |title=Energy Savers: Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, there are over one million units installed worldwide providing 12 GW of thermal capacity, with an annual growth rate of 10%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

==Differing terms and definitions==
[[File:Geothermal Systems.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ground source heating and cooling]]
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Some confusion exists with regard to the terminology of heat pumps and the use of the term "''geothermal''". "''Geothermal''" derives from the Greek and means "''Earth heat''" – which geologists and many laymen understand as describing hot rocks, volcanic activity or heat derived from deep within the earth. Though some confusion arises when the term "''geothermal''" is also used to apply to temperatures within the first 100 metres of the surface, this is "''Earth heat''" all the same, though it is largely influenced by stored energy from the sun.

==History==
The heat pump was described by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1853 and developed by [[Peter Ritter von Rittinger]] in 1855. After experimenting with a freezer, Robert C. Webber built the first direct exchange ground-source heat pump in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/about/about_us.htm|title=History |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=About Us |publisher=International Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful commercial project was installed in the [[Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon)]] in 1948, and has been designated a [[National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by [[ASME]].&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; The technology became popular in Sweden in the 1970s, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. Open loop systems dominated the market until the development of [[polybutylene]] pipe in 1979 made closed loop systems economically viable.&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; As of 2004, there are over a million units installed worldwide providing 12&amp;nbsp;GW of thermal capacity.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 =Lund | first1 =J. | last2 =Sanner | first2 =B. | last3 =Rybach | first3 =L. | last4 =Curtis | first4 =R. | last5 =Hellström | first5 =G. |date = September 2004| title =Geothermal (Ground Source) Heat Pumps, A World Overview | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =25 | issue =3 | pages =1–10 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull25-3/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}

==Ground heat exchanger==
{{see also|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}
[[Image:Pond Loop Close Up.jpg|thumb|right|Loop field for a 12-ton system (unusually large for most residential applications)]]

Heat pumps provide winter heating by extracting heat from a source and transferring it into a building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground source heat pump uses the top layer of the earth's crust as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderated temperature.

In the summer, the process can be reversed so the heat pump extracts heat from the building and transfers it to the ground. Transferring heat to a cooler space takes less energy, so the cooling efficiency of the heat pump gains benefits from the lower ground temperature.

Ground source heat pumps employ a [[heat exchanger]] in contact with the ground or groundwater to extract or dissipate heat. This component accounts for anywhere from a fifth to half of the total system cost, and would be the most cumbersome part to repair or replace. Correctly sizing this component is necessary to assure long-term performance: the energy efficiency of the system improves with roughly 4% for every degree Celsius that is won through correct sizing, and the underground temperature balance must be maintained through proper design of the whole system. Incorrect design can result in the system freezing after a number of years or very inefficient system performance; thus accurate system design is critical to a successful system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/ground-source-heat-pumps/ground-source-heating-cooling/|title=GSHC Viability and Design – Carbon Zero Consulting|author=|date=|website=carbonzeroco.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shallow {{Convert|3-8|foot|m|adj = on}} horizontal heat exchangers experience seasonal temperature cycles due to solar gains and transmission losses to ambient air at ground level. These temperature cycles lag behind the seasons because of thermal inertia, so the heat exchanger will harvest heat deposited by the sun several months earlier, while being weighed down in late winter and spring, due to accumulated winter cold. Deep vertical systems {{Convert|100-500|feet|m}} deep rely on migration of heat from surrounding geology, unless they are recharged annually by solar recharge of the ground or exhaust heat from air conditioning systems.

Several major design options are available for these, which are classified by fluid and layout. Direct exchange systems circulate refrigerant underground, closed loop systems use a mixture of anti-freeze and water, and open loop systems use natural groundwater.

===Direct exchange (DX)===
{{Main article|Direct exchange geothermal heat pump}}
The [[direct exchange geothermal heat pump]] (DX) is the oldest type of geothermal heat pump technology. The ground-coupling is achieved through a single loop, circulating refrigerant, in direct thermal contact with the ground (as opposed to a combination of a refrigerant loop and a water loop). The [[refrigerant]] leaves the heat pump cabinet, circulates through a loop of copper tube buried underground, and exchanges heat with the ground before returning to the pump. The name "direct exchange" refers to heat transfer between the refrigerant loop and the ground without the use of an intermediate fluid. There is no direct interaction between the fluid and the earth; only heat transfer through the pipe wall. Direct exchange heat pumps are not to be confused with "water-source heat pumps" or "water loop heat pumps" since there is no water in the ground loop. [http://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/ ASHRAE] defines the term ground-coupled heat pump to encompass closed loop and direct exchange systems, while excluding open loops.
[[File:DX system in a house.jpg|thumb|Direct exchange geothermal system]]
Direct exchange systems are more efficient and have potentially lower installation costs than closed loop water systems. Copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] contributes to the higher efficiency of the system, but heat flow is predominantly limited by the thermal conductivity of the ground, not the pipe. The main reasons for the higher efficiency are the elimination of the water pump (which uses electricity), the elimination of the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (which is a source of heat losses), and most importantly, the latent heat phase change of the refrigerant in the ground itself.

However, in case of leakage there is virtually no risk of contaminating the ground or the ground water. Contrary to water-source geothermal systems, direct exchange systems do not contain antifreeze. So, in case of a refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant currently used in most systems – R-410A – would immediately vaporize and seek the atmosphere. This is due to the low boiling point of R-410A: {{convert|-51|C|F}}.  R-410A refrigerant replaces larger volumes of antifreeze mixtures used in water-source geothermal systems and presents no threat to aquifers or to the ground itself.

While they require more refrigerant and their tubing is more expensive per foot, a direct exchange earth loop is shorter than a closed water loop for a given capacity. A direct exchange system requires only 15 to 40% of the length of tubing and half the diameter of drilled holes, and the drilling or excavation costs are therefore lower. Refrigerant loops are less tolerant of leaks than water loops because gas can leak out through smaller imperfections. This dictates the use of brazed copper tubing, even though the pressures are similar to water loops. The copper loop must be protected from corrosion in acidic soil through the use of a [[sacrificial anode]] or other [[cathodic protection]].

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted field monitoring of a direct geoexchange heat pump water heating system in a commercial application. The EPA reported that the system saved 75% of the electrical energy that would have been required by an electrical resistance water heating unit. According to the EPA, if the system is operated to capacity, it can avoid the emission of up to 7,100 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 15 pounds of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; each year per ton of compressor capacity (or 42,600&amp;nbsp;lbs. of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   and 90&amp;nbsp;lbs. of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for a typical 6 ton system).&lt;ref name="EPAdoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227091649/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern climates, although the earth temperature is cooler, so is the incoming water temperature, which enables the high efficiency systems to replace more energy than would otherwise be required of electric or fossil fuel fired systems. Any temperature above {{convert|-40|C|F}} is sufficient to evaporate the refrigerant, and the direct exchange system can harvest energy through ice.

In extremely hot climates with dry soil, the addition of an auxiliary cooling module as a second condenser in line between the compressor and the earth loops increases efficiency and can further reduce the amount of earth loop to be installed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Closed loop===
Most installed systems have two loops on the ground side: the primary refrigerant loop is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The secondary loop is typically made of [[high-density polyethylene]] pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze ([[propylene glycol]], [[denatured alcohol]] or [[methanol]]). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in an increasing number of European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the secondary loop outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The secondary loop is placed below the [[frost line]] where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available. Systems in wet ground or in water are generally more efficient than drier ground loops since water conducts and stores heat better than solids in sand or soil. If the ground is naturally dry, soaker hoses may be buried with the ground loop to keep it wet.

[[Image:Pump Pack.jpg|thumb|right|An installed liquid pump pack]]
Closed loop systems need a heat exchanger between the refrigerant loop and the water loop, and pumps in both loops. Some manufacturers have a separate ground loop fluid pump pack, while some integrate the pumping and valving within the heat pump. Expansion tanks and pressure relief valves may be installed on the heated fluid side. Closed loop systems have lower efficiency than direct exchange systems, so they require longer and larger pipe to be placed in the ground, increasing excavation costs.

Closed loop tubing can be installed horizontally as a loop field in trenches or vertically as a series of long U-shapes in wells (see below). The size of the loop field depends on the soil type and moisture content, the average ground temperature and the heat loss and or gain characteristics of the building being conditioned. A rough approximation of the initial soil temperature is the average daily temperature for the region.

====Vertical====
[[File:Geothermal drilling for residential heating.jpg|thumb|Drilling of a borehole for residential heating]]
A vertical closed loop field is composed of pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically {{convert|50|to(-)|400|ft}} deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector at the bottom of the hole. The [[borehole]] is commonly filled with a [[bentonite]] [[grout]] surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the [[heat transfer]]. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents [[artesian wells]] from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5–6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three boreholes {{convert|80|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers" /&gt; (A ton of heat is 12,000 [[British thermal unit]]s per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 [[kilowatt]]s.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.

====Horizontal====
[[Image:3-ton Slinky Loop.jpg|thumb|right|A three-ton slinky loop prior to being covered with soil. The three slinky loops are running out horizontally with three straight lines returning the end of the slinky coil to the heat pump.]]
A horizontal closed loop field is composed of pipes that run horizontally in the ground. A long horizontal [[trench]], deeper than the [[frost line]], is dug and U-shaped or slinky coils are placed horizontally inside the same trench. Excavation for shallow horizontal loop fields is about half the cost of vertical drilling, so this is the most common layout used wherever there is adequate land available. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three loops {{convert|120|to|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} long of [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] 3/4 (DN&amp;nbsp;20) or NPS&amp;nbsp;1.25 (DN&amp;nbsp;32) polyethylene tubing at a depth of {{convert|1|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Chiasson1999&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Advances in modeling of ground source heat pump systems | url = http://www.solis.pl/index.php/content/download/375/1291/file/GROUND%20SOURCE%20HEAT.pdf | year = 1999 | author = Chiasson, A.D. | publisher = Oklahoma State University

The depth at which the loops are placed significantly influences the energy consumption of the heat pump in two opposite ways: shallow loops tend to indirectly absorb more heat from the sun, which is helpful, especially when the ground is still cold after a long winter. On the other hand, shallow loops are also cooled down much more readily by weather changes, especially during long cold winters, when heating demand peaks. Often, the second effect is much greater than the first one, leading to higher costs of operation for the more shallow ground loops. This problem can be reduced by increasing both the depth and the length of piping, thereby significantly increasing costs of installation. However, such expenses might be deemed feasible, as they may result in lower operating costs. Recent studies show that utilization of a non-homogeneous soil profile with a layer of low conductive material above the ground pipes can help mitigate the adverse effects of shallow pipe burial depth. The intermediate blanket with lower conductivity than the surrounding soil profile demonstrated the potential to increase the energy extraction rates from the ground to as high as 17% for a cold climate and about 5–6% for a relatively moderate climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rezaei | first1 = B. | last2 = Amir | first2 = Kolahdouz | last3 = Dargush | first3 = G.

A slinky (also called coiled) closed loop field is a type of horizontal closed loop where the pipes overlay each other (not a recommended method). The easiest way of picturing a slinky field is to imagine holding a [[slinky]] on the top and bottom with your hands and then moving your hands in opposite directions. A slinky loop field is used if there is not adequate room for a true horizontal system, but it still allows for an easy installation. Rather than using straight pipe, slinky coils use overlapped loops of piping laid out horizontally along the bottom of a wide trench. Depending on soil, climate and the heat pump's run fraction, slinky coil trenches can be up to two thirds shorter than traditional horizontal loop trenches. Slinky coil ground loops are essentially a more economical and space efficient version of a horizontal ground loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informedbuilding.com/Geothermal/Main16/Types-of-Geothermal-Ground-Loops/ |title=Geothermal Ground Loops |publisher=Informed Building |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radial or directional drilling====
As an alternative to trenching, loops may be laid by mini [[horizontal directional drilling]] (mini-HDD). This technique can lay piping under yards, driveways, gardens or other structures without disturbing them, with a cost between those of trenching and vertical drilling. This system also differs from horizontal &amp; vertical drilling as the loops are installed from one central chamber, further reducing the ground space needed. Radial drilling is often installed retroactively (after the property has been built) due to the small nature of the equipment used and the ability to bore beneath existing constructions.

====Pond====
[[Image:Pond Loop Being Sunk.jpg|thumb|right|12-ton pond loop system being sunk to the bottom of a pond]]
A closed pond loop is not common because it depends on proximity to a body of water, where an open loop system is usually preferable. A pond loop may be advantageous where poor water quality precludes an open loop, or where the system heat load is small. A pond loop consists of coils of pipe similar to a slinky loop attached to a frame and located at the bottom of an appropriately sized pond or water source.

===Open loop===
In an open loop system (also called a groundwater heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. [[ASHRAE]] calls open loop systems ''groundwater heat pumps'' or ''surface water heat pumps'', depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate [[injection well]], [[irrigation trench]], tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance may need to be protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. [[Limescale]] may [[fouling|foul]] the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hard water#Indices]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.

[[Deep lake water cooling]] uses a similar process with an open loop for air conditioning and cooling. Open loop systems using ground water are usually more efficient than closed systems because they are better coupled with ground temperatures. Closed loop systems, in comparison, have to transfer heat across extra layers of pipe wall and dirt.

A growing number of jurisdictions have outlawed open-loop systems that drain to the surface because these may drain aquifers or contaminate wells. This forces the use of more environmentally sound injection wells or a closed loop system.

====Standing column well====
A standing column well system is a specialized type of open loop system. Water is drawn from the bottom of a deep rock well, passed through a heat pump, and returned to the top of the well, where traveling downwards it exchanges heat with the surrounding bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Orio |first1=Carl D. |last2=Johnson |first2=Carl N. |last3=Rees |first3=Simon J. |last4=Chiasson |first4=A. |last5=Deng |first5=Zheng |last6=Spitler |first6=Jeffrey D. |year=2004 |title=A Survey of Standing Column Well Installations in North America |periodical=ASHRAE Transactions |publisher=ASHRAE |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=637–655 |url=http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-25 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095818/http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a standing column well system is often dictated where there is near-surface bedrock and limited surface area is available. A standing column is typically not suitable in locations where the geology is mostly clay, silt, or sand. If bedrock is deeper than {{convert|200|ft}} from the surface, the cost of casing to seal off the overburden may become prohibitive.

A multiple standing column well system can support a large structure in an urban or rural application. The standing column well method is also popular in residential and small commercial applications. There are many successful applications of varying sizes and well quantities in the many boroughs of New York City, and is also the most common application in the New England states. This type of ground source system has some heat storage benefits, where heat is rejected from the building and the temperature of the well is raised, within reason, during the summer cooling months which can then be harvested for heating in the winter months, thereby increasing the efficiency of the heat pump system. As with closed loop systems, sizing of the standing column system is critical in reference to the heat loss and gain of the existing building. As the heat exchange is actually with the bedrock, using water as the transfer medium, a large amount of production capacity (water flow from the well) is not required for a standing column system to work. However, if there is adequate water production, then the thermal capacity of the well system can be enhanced by discharging a small percentage of system flow during the peak Summer and Winter months.

Since this is essentially a water pumping system, standing column well design requires critical considerations to obtain peak operating efficiency. Should a standing column well design be misapplied, leaving out critical shut-off valves for example, the result could be an extreme loss in efficiency and thereby cause operational cost to be higher than anticipated.

==Building distribution==
[[Image:Water to Air Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|left|Liquid-to-air heat pump]]
The heat pump is the central unit that becomes the heating and cooling plant for the building. Some models may cover space heating, space cooling, (space heating via conditioned air, [[hydronic]] systems and / or [[radiant heating]] systems), domestic or pool water preheat (via the [[wikt:desuperheater|desuperheater]] function), demand hot water, and driveway ice melting all within one appliance with a variety of options with respect to controls, staging and zone control. The heat may be carried to its end use by circulating water or forced air. Almost all types of heat pumps are produced for commercial and residential applications.

''Liquid-to-air'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-air'') output forced air, and are most commonly used to replace legacy forced air furnaces and central air conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems. Heat pumps cannot achieve as high a fluid temperature as a conventional furnace, so they require a higher volume flow rate of air to compensate. When retrofitting a residence, the existing duct work may have to be enlarged to reduce the noise from the higher air flow.

[[Image:Water to Water Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid-to-water heat pump]]
''Liquid-to-water'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-water'') are [[hydronic]] systems that use water to carry heating or cooling through the building. Systems such as radiant [[underfloor heating]], [[baseboard radiator]]s, [[wall radiator|conventional cast iron radiator]]s would use a liquid-to-water heat pump. These heat pumps are preferred for pool heating or domestic hot water pre-heat. Heat pumps can only heat water to about {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} efficiently, whereas a boiler normally reaches {{convert|65|–|95|C|F}}. Legacy radiators designed for these higher temperatures may have to be doubled in numbers when retrofitting a home. A hot water tank will still be needed to raise water temperatures above the heat pump's maximum, but pre-heating will save 25–50% of hot water costs.

Ground source heat pumps are especially well matched to underfloor heating and baseboard radiator systems which only require warm temperatures 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) to work well. Thus they are ideal for open plan offices. Using large surfaces such as floors, as opposed to radiators, distributes the heat more uniformly and allows for a lower water temperature. Wood or carpet floor coverings dampen this effect because the thermal transfer efficiency of these materials is lower than that of masonry floors (tile, concrete). Underfloor piping, ceiling or wall radiators can also be used for cooling in dry climates, although the temperature of the circulating water must be above the [[dew point]] to ensure that atmospheric humidity does not condense on the radiator.

Combination heat pumps are available that can produce forced air and circulating water simultaneously and individually. These systems are largely being used for houses that have a combination of air and liquid conditioning needs, for example central air conditioning and pool heating.

==Seasonal thermal storage==
[[Image:HeatAndColdStorageWithHeatPump.svg|thumb|right|A heat pump in combination with heat and cold storage]]
{{Main article|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
The efficiency of ground source heat pumps can be greatly improved by using [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] and interseasonal heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/interseasonal_heat_transfer.html |title=Interseasonal Heat Transfer |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat captured and stored in thermal banks in the summer can be retrieved efficiently in the winter. Heat storage efficiency increases with scale, so this advantage is most significant in commercial or [[district heating]] systems.

[[Geosolar combisystem]]s have been used to heat and cool a greenhouse using an [[aquifer]] for thermal storage.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Passel|first1=Willy|last2=Sourbron|first2=Maarten|last3=Verplaetsen|first3=Filip |last4=Leroy|first4=Luc |last5=Somers|first5=Yvan |last6=Verheyden|first6=Johan |last7=Coupé|first7=Koen|editor=Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie Vlaanderen|title=Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming|url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-23|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer, the greenhouse is cooled with cold ground water. This heats the water in the aquifer which can become a warm source for heating in winter.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonneterp.nl/english/index_uk.html |title=Schematic of similar system of aquifers with fans-regulation |publisher=Zonneterp.nl |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of cold and heat storage with heat pumps can be combined with water/humidity regulation. These principles are used to provide [[renewable heat]] and renewable cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/renewable_cooling.html |title=Capture, storage and release of Renewable Cooling |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to all kinds of buildings.

Also the efficiency of existing small heat pump installations can be improved by adding large, cheap, water filled solar collectors. These may be integrated into a to-be-overhauled parking lot, or in walls or roof constructions by installing one-inch [[Polyethylene|PE]] pipes into the outer layer.

==Thermal efficiency==
{{Main article|Thermal efficiency}}
The net [[thermal efficiency]] of a heat pump should take into account the efficiency of electricity generation and transmission, typically about 30%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;  Since a heat pump moves three to five times more heat energy than the electric energy it consumes, the total energy output is much greater than the electrical input. This results in net thermal efficiencies greater than 300% as compared to radiant electric heat being 100% efficient. Traditional combustion furnaces and [[electric heater]]s can never exceed 100% efficiency.

Geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption— and corresponding air pollution emissions—up to 44% compared to air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared to electric resistance heating with standard air-conditioning equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24782.pdf Geothermal Heat Pumps]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dependence of net thermal efficiency on the electricity infrastructure tends to be an unnecessary complication for consumers and is not applicable to hydroelectric power, so performance of heat pumps is usually expressed as the ratio of heating output or heat removal to electricity input. Cooling performance is typically expressed in units of BTU/hr/watt as the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio|energy efficiency ratio]] (EER), while heating performance is typically reduced to dimensionless units as the [[Coefficient of Performance|coefficient of performance]] (COP). The conversion factor is 3.41 BTU/hr/watt. Performance is influenced by all components of the installed system, including the soil conditions, the ground-coupled heat exchanger, the heat pump appliance, and the building distribution, but is largely determined by the "lift" between the input temperature and the output temperature.

For the sake of comparing heat pump appliances to each other, independently from other system components, a few standard test conditions have been established by the [[American Refrigerant Institute]] (ARI) and more recently by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. Standard ARI 330 ratings were intended for closed loop ground-source heat pumps, and assume secondary loop water temperatures of {{convert|25|C|F}} for air conditioning and {{convert|0|C|F}} for heating. These temperatures are typical of installations in the northern US. Standard ARI 325 ratings were intended for open loop ground-source heat pumps, and include two sets of ratings for groundwater temperatures of {{convert|10|C|F}} and {{convert|21|C|F}}. ARI 325 budgets more electricity for water pumping than ARI 330. Neither of these standards attempt to account for seasonal variations. Standard ARI 870 ratings are intended for direct exchange ground-source heat pumps. [[ASHRAE]] transitioned to ISO 13256-1 in 2001, which replaces ARI 320, 325 and 330. The new ISO standard produces slightly higher ratings because it no longer budgets any electricity for water pumps.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;

Efficient compressors, variable speed compressors and larger heat exchangers all contribute to heat pump efficiency. Residential ground source heat pumps on the market today have standard COPs ranging from 2.4 to 5.0 and EERs ranging from 10.6 to 30.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahridirectory.org/ahriDirectory/pages/wbahp/defaultSearch.aspx |title=AHRI Directory of water-to-air geothermal heat pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for an [[Energy Star]] label, heat pumps must meet certain minimum COP and EER ratings which depend on the ground heat exchanger type. For closed loop systems, the ISO 13256-1 heating COP must be 3.3 or greater and the cooling EER must be 14.1 or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/eligibility/geo_heat_pump_elig.pdf |title=Energy Star Program Requirements for Geothermal Heat PUmps |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Partner Commitments |publisher=Energy Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual installation conditions may produce better or worse efficiency than the standard test conditions. COP improves with a lower temperature difference between the input and output of the heat pump, so the stability of ground temperatures is important. If the loop field or water pump is undersized, the addition or removal of heat may push the ground temperature beyond standard test conditions, and performance will be degraded. Similarly, an undersized blower may allow the plenum coil to overheat and degrade performance.

Soil without artificial heat addition or subtraction and at depths of several metres or more remains at a relatively constant temperature year round. This temperature equates roughly to the average annual air-temperature of the chosen location, usually {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} at a depth of {{convert|6|m}} in the northern US. Because this temperature remains more constant than the air temperature throughout the seasons, geothermal heat pumps perform with far greater efficiency during extreme air temperatures than air conditioners and air-source heat pumps.

Standards ARI 210 and 240 define [[Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (SEER) and [[Heating Seasonal Performance Factor]]s (HSPF) to account for the impact of seasonal variations on air source heat pumps. These numbers are normally not applicable and should not be compared to ground source heat pump ratings. However, [[Natural Resources Canada]] has adapted this approach to calculate typical seasonally adjusted HSPFs for ground-source heat pumps in Canada.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |title=Ground Source Heat Pumps (Earth Energy Systems) |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Heating and Cooling with a Heat Pump |publisher=Natural Resources Canada, Office of Energy Efficiency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403212025/http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-03 |df= }} Note: contrary to air-source conventions, the NRC's HSPF numbers are in units of BTU/hr/watt. Divide these numbers by 3.41 BTU/hr/watt to arrive at non-dimensional units comparable to ground-source COPs and air-source HSPF.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC HSPFs ranged from 8.7 to 12.8 BTU/hr/watt (2.6 to 3.8 in nondimensional factors, or 255% to 375% seasonal average electricity utilization efficiency) for the most populated regions of Canada. When combined with the thermal efficiency of electricity, this corresponds to net average thermal efficiencies of 100% to 150%.

==Environmental impact==
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Environmental Protection Agency|title= Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier – Report 430-R-93-004|publisher= EPA|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential, particularly where they are used for both heating and cooling and where the electricity is produced from renewable resources.

GSHPs have unsurpassed thermal efficiencies and produce zero emissions locally, but their electricity supply includes components with high greenhouse gas emissions, unless the owner has opted for a 100% [[renewable energy]] supply. Their environmental impact therefore depends on the characteristics of the electricity supply and the available alternatives.

The GHG emissions savings from a heat pump over a conventional furnace can be calculated based on the following formula:&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Hanova | first1 = J | last2 = Dowlatabadi | first2 = H | date =9 November 2007 | title =Strategic GHG reduction through the use of ground source heat pump technology | periodical =Environmental Research Letters | place =UK | publisher =IOP Publishing | volume =2 | pages = 044001 8pp | url =http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1748-9326/2/4/044001/erl7_4_044001.pdf?request-id=dd247af1-1eb0-4c8d-a20b-426d37d8ee5f | issn =1748-9326 | doi =10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/044001 | accessdate =2009-03-22 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode =2007ERL.....2d4001H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;GHG\ Savings=HL \left( \frac{FI}{AFUE \times 1000\frac{kg}{ton}}-\frac{EI}{COP \times 3600\frac{sec}{hr}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
*HL = seasonal heat load ≈ 80 GJ/yr for a modern detached house in the northern US
*FI = emissions intensity of fuel = 50&amp;nbsp;kg(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GJ for natural gas, 73 for heating oil, 0 for 100% [[renewable energy]] such as wind, hydro, photovoltaic or solar thermal
*[[AFUE]] = furnace efficiency ≈ 95% for a modern [[condensing furnace]]
*COP = heat pump coefficient of performance ≈ 3.2 seasonally adjusted for northern US heat pump
*EI = emissions intensity of electricity ≈ 200–800 ton(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GWh, depending on region

Ground-source heat pumps always produce fewer greenhouse gases than air conditioners, oil furnaces, and electric heating, but natural gas furnaces may be competitive depending on the greenhouse gas intensity of the local electricity supply. In countries like Canada and Russia with low emitting electricity infrastructure, a residential heat pump may save 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year relative to an oil furnace, or about as much as taking an average passenger car off the road. But in cities like Beijing or Pittsburgh that are highly reliant on coal for electricity production, a heat pump may result in 1 or 2 tons more carbon dioxide emissions than a natural gas furnace.  For areas not served by utility natural gas infrastructure, however, no better alternative exists.

The fluids used in closed loops may be designed to be biodegradable and non-toxic, but the refrigerant used in the heat pump cabinet and in direct exchange loops was, until recently, [[chlorodifluoromethane]], which is an ozone depleting substance.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rafferty | first = Kevin |date = April 1997| title =An Information Survival Kit for the Prospective Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Owner | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =18 | issue =2 | pages = 1–11 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull18-2/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} The author issued an [http://geoheat.oit.edu/ghp/survival.pdf updated version] of this article in February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although harmless while contained, leaks and improper end-of-life disposal contribute to enlarging the [[ozone hole]].  For new construction, this refrigerant is being phased out in favor of the ozone-friendly but potent greenhouse gas [[R410A]]. The [[EcoCute]] water heater is an air-source heat pump that uses [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] as its working fluid instead of [[chlorofluorocarbons]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Open loop systems (i.e. those that draw ground water as opposed to closed loop systems using a borehole heat exchanger) need to be balanced by reinjecting the spent water. This prevents [[aquifer]] depletion and the contamination of soil or surface water with brine or other compounds from underground.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Before drilling, the underground geology needs to be understood, and drillers need to be prepared to seal the borehole, including preventing penetration of water between strata. The unfortunate example is a geothermal heating project in [[Staufen im Breisgau]], Germany which seems the cause of considerable damage to historical buildings there. In 2008, the city centre was reported to have risen 12&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,589944,00.html Spiegel.de report on recent geological changes] (in German, partial [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/11/town-rips-up.html translation])&lt;/ref&gt; after initially sinking a few millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583323/Geothermal-probe-sinks-German-city.html|title=Geothermal probe sinks German city|first=Bojan|last=Pancevski|date=30 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The boring tapped a naturally pressurized aquifer, and via the borehole this water entered a layer of anhydrite, which expands when wet as it forms gypsum. The swelling will stop when the anhydrite is fully reacted, and reconstruction of the city center "is not expedient until the uplift ceases."

Ground-source heat pump technology, like building orientation, is a [[natural building]] technique ([[bioclimatic building]]).

==Economics==
Ground source heat pumps are characterized by high capital costs and low operational costs compared to other [[HVAC]] systems. Their overall economic benefit depends primarily on the relative costs of electricity and fuels, which are highly variable over time and across the world. Based on recent prices, ground-source heat pumps currently have lower operational costs than any other conventional heating source almost everywhere in the world. Natural gas is the only fuel with competitive operational costs, and only in a handful of countries where it is exceptionally cheap, or where electricity is exceptionally expensive.&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; In general, a homeowner may save anywhere from 20% to 60% annually on utilities by switching from an ordinary system to a ground-source system.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium, Inc. |url=http://geoexchange.us/ |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economics"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Lienau | first1 =Paul J.  | last2 =Boyd | first2 =Tonya L.  | last3 =Rogers | first3 =Robert L.  |date = April 1995| title =Ground-Source Heat Pump Case Studies and Utility Programs | place =Klamath Falls, OR | publisher =Geo-Heat Center, Oregon Institute of Technology | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/hp1.pdf | accessdate=2009-03-26 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital costs and system lifespan have received much less study until recently, and the [[return on investment]] is highly variable. The most recent data from an analysis of 2011–2012 incentive payments in the state of Maryland showed an average cost of residential systems of $1.90 per watt, or about $26,700 for a typical (4 ton) home system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenThermal.org analysis of geothermal incentive payments in the state of Maryland|url=http://openthermal.net/md/|publisher=OpenThermal.org|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An older study found the total installed cost for a system with 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 ton) thermal capacity for a detached rural residence in the US averaged $8000–$9000 in 1995 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kavanaugh|first1=Steve|last2=Gilbreath|first2=Christopher|editor=Joseph Kilpatrick|title=Cost Containment for Ground-Source Heat Pumps|url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/tp72.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|edition=final report|date=December 1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies found an average cost of $14,000 in 2008 US dollars for the same size system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=Paul|title=Indiana Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Rebate, Program Review|url=http://www.in.gov/oed/files/GHPProgramreport.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|date=June 2008|publisher=Indiana Office of Energy and Defense Development|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oakridge"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. | title = Geothermal (Ground-Source) Heat Pumps: Market Status, Barriers to Adoption, and Actions to Overcome Barriers| last1 = Hughes| publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory | year = 2008| doi = 10.2172/948543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Energy estimates a price of $7500 on its website, last updated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12670 |title=Energy Savers: Selecting and Installing a Geothermal Heat Pump System |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source in Canada placed prices in the range of $30,000–$34,000 Canadian dollars.&lt;ref name="retscreen"&gt;{{Cite book |editor=RETscreen International|title=Clean Energy Project Analysis: RETscreen Engineering &amp; Cases Textbook |url=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/12.php |accessdate=2009-04-20 |year=2005 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |isbn=0-662-39150-0 |id=Catalogue no.: M39-110/2005E-PDF |chapter=Ground-Source Heat Pump Project Analysis |chapterurl=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/textbook_gshp.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid escalation in system price has been accompanied by rapid improvements in efficiency and reliability. Capital costs are known to benefit from economies of scale, particularly for open loop systems, so they are more cost-effective for larger commercial buildings and harsher climates. The initial cost can be two to five times that of a conventional heating system in most residential applications, new construction or existing. In retrofits, the cost of installation is affected by the size of living area, the home's age, insulation characteristics, the geology of the area, and location of the property. Proper duct system design and mechanical air exchange should be considered in the initial system cost.

Capital costs may be offset by government subsidies; for example,  Ontario offered $7000 for residential systems installed in the 2009 fiscal year. Some electric companies offer special rates to customers who install a ground-source heat pump for heating or cooling their building.&lt;ref name="geothermal_incentive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |title=Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=[[Capital Electric Cooperative]] |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206122801/http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where electrical plants have larger loads during summer months and idle capacity in the winter, this increases electrical sales during the winter months. Heat pumps also lower the load peak  during the summer due to the increased efficiency of heat pumps, thereby avoiding costly construction of new power plants. For the same reasons, other utility companies have started to pay for the installation of ground-source heat pumps at customer residences. They lease the systems to their customers for a monthly fee, at a net overall saving to the customer.

The lifespan of the system is longer than conventional heating and cooling systems. Good data on system lifespan is not yet available because the technology is too recent, but many early systems are still operational today after 25–30 years with routine maintenance. Most loop fields have warranties for 25 to 50 years and are expected to last at least 50 to 200 years.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghpcFAQ"/&gt; Ground-source heat pumps use electricity for heating the house. The higher investment above conventional oil, propane or electric systems may be returned in energy savings in 2–10 years for residential systems in the US.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ghpcFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal heat pumps: alternative energy heating and cooling FAQs |url=http://www.econar.com/faq.htm |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903210053/http://www.econar.com/faq.htm |archivedate=2007-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If compared to natural gas systems, the payback period can be much longer or non-existent. The payback period for larger commercial systems in the US is 1–5 years, even when compared to natural gas.&lt;ref name="economics" /&gt; Additionally, because geothermal heat pumps usually have no outdoor compressors or cooling towers, the risk of vandalism is reduced or eliminated, potentially extending a system's lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of a Geothermal Heat Pump System |url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/benefits-of-a-geothermal-heat-pump-system.html |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground source heat pumps are recognized as one of the most efficient heating and cooling systems on the market. They are often the second-most cost effective solution in extreme climates (after [[co-generation]]), despite reductions in thermal efficiency due to ground temperature. (The ground source is warmer in climates that need strong air conditioning, and cooler in climates that need strong heating.) The financial viability of these systems depends on the adequate sizing of ground heat exchangers (GHEs), which generally contribute the most to the overall capital costs of GSHP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icebookshop.com/Products/Geothermal-Energy,-Heat-Exchange-Systems-and-Energ.aspx|title=Geothermal Energy, Heat Exchange Systems and Energy Piles|last=Craig|first=William|last2=Gavin|first2=Kenneth|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763983|location=London|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial systems maintenance costs in the US have historically been between $0.11 to $0.22 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year in 1996 dollars, much less than the average $0.54 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year for conventional HVAC systems.&lt;ref name="bloomquist"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bloomquist | first = R.

Governments that promote renewable energy will likely offer incentives for the consumer (residential), or industrial markets. For example, in the United States, incentives are offered both on the state and federal levels of government.&lt;ref name="mmar2009"&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222100703/http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 |date=2008-02-22 }}. US Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] provides a financial incentive for generation of renewable heat based on metered readings on an annual basis for 20 years for commercial buildings. The domestic Renewable Heat Incentive is due to be introduced in Spring 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 to 2015 government policy: low carbon technologies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies#appendix-6-renewable-heat-incentive-rhi|publisher=www.gov.uk|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for seven years and be based on deemed heat.

==Installation==
Because of the technical knowledge and equipment needed to design and size the system properly (and install the piping if heat fusion is required), a GSHP system installation requires a professional's services. Several installers have published real-time views of system performance in an online community of recent residential installations.  The [[International Ground Source Heat Pump Association]] ([[IGSHPA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGSHPA|url=http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/|publisher=www.igshpa.okstate.edu|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal Exchange Organization (GEO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Executive Order on Sustainability Includes Geothermal Heat Pumps|url=https://www.geoexchange.org/|publisher=www.geoexchange.org|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.geo-exchange.ca/ Canadian GeoExchange Coalition] and the [http://www.gshp.org.uk/ Ground Source Heat Pump Association] maintain listings of qualified installers in the US, Canada and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12670 |title=Energy Savers: Selecting and Installing a Geothermal Heat Pump System |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, detailed analysis of Soil thermal conductivity for horizontal systems and formation thermal conductivity for vertical systems will generally result in more accurately design systems with a higher efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/|title=Horizontal &amp; Vertical Thermal Conductivity |publisher=Carbonzeroco.com |date=2016-03-23 |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SDG Latex Hands.jpg|thumb|Black latex gloves]]
[[File:Disposable gloves 09.JPG|thumb|Latex]]
'''Glove fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetishism]] where an individual is [[sexually stimulated]], often to the point of obsession, by another person or oneself wearing [[glove]]s on their hands. In some cases, the fetish is enhanced by the material of the glove (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[leather]], [[cotton]], [[latex]], [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[satin]] or [[nylon]]). Often, the actions of a gloved hand are as arousing as the glove itself, because the glove provides a second skin, or in other words a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. [[Medical gloves]] and [[rubber gloves]] provide not only a safer sex environment, but also give a latex glove fetishist great pleasure. Subtle movements by the gloved fingers or the hand as a whole can provide the individual with a great visual stimulus and ultimately [[sexual arousal]]. The act of putting gloves on, or slipping them off the hands, can also be a source of glove fetish fantasy. Smell is also a factor when it comes to latex, rubber, and leather gloves. 

Medical glove fetishism involves thin latex gloves, which come in many different types. Personal preference ranges from color, smell, size, textured, smooth, powdered, or un-powdered. Fetishists are proud of their collection of medical gloves, as well as rubber gloves. Household rubber gloves tend to be more thick, longer, and are mostly used for cleaning purposes. 

Some glove fetishists prefer certain lengths, for example the [[Evening glove|long opera-style]] or short cuff length. Some also like them as a part of an outfit, such as a [[nurse]], [[police officer|policewoman]] or [[French maid]] uniform.  Some who are of a sexually submissive nature are stimulated by their dominant partner's wearing and use of gloves.  Dominant partners may likewise prefer that their submissives wear gloves.  As with all fetishes however, there need not be a BDSM connection to an affinity for gloves.

Apart from their appearance, some individuals prefer to use them on oneself or others as a form of sexual stimulation. The ones most commonly used for this are made of leather, latex (such as those doctors or nurses use for examination), while others prefer the household rubber glove. The appeal behind the household glove may be due to the colours they come in but also offering what the latex examination gloves cannot; household gloves are thicker, some more than others depending on what their use is. Many enjoy [[erotic spanking]] with gloves donned. It offers a different feeling and sound to the "spankee", which can be a large part of the fetish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize–winning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

[[File:Penn Station2.jpg|thumb|[[Demolition]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] concourse raised public awareness about preservation]]
&lt;!--the term historic preservation is seemingly almost exclusively found in United States English; other terms are used in other English speaking cultures, though certain non-English phrases may directly transliterate as "Historic Preservation"; as a result of the ambiguous usage of the term, this was chosen as the primary article; other potential meanings are referenced in the hatnote; see discussion pages for details.--&gt;

'''Historic preservation''' (US), '''heritage preservation''' or '''heritage conservation''' (UK), is an endeavour that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance.
This term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===England===
In [[England]], [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] were often also Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

[[File:Castle Berkhamsted cz.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Berkhamsted from the Norman Castle's Motte|The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)]]Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and its church in Edinburgh, [[Furness Abbey]], [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] and [[Northampton Castle]], and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 [[Berkhamsted Castle]] became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 1833{{ndash}}1837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.&lt;ref name="Wheeler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wheeler|title=Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-cloud of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4377-2|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early preservation event also occurred at [[Berkhamsted]]. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at [[Ashridge]], tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, [[Common land]] was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been [[enclosure|enclosed]] by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in [[direct action]] to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.&lt;ref name=Cobb1893p26&gt;{{harvnb|Cobb|1883|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood2006p245&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|2008|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtchnell1988psNone&gt;{{harvnb|Birtchnell|1988|ps=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]] (later co-founder of the [[National Trust]] in 1895) and the [[Commons Preservation Society]] succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.&lt;ref name="commons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1886|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashbrook |first=Kate |url=http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/more-news/exhibition-and-commemorative-walk-marks-anniversary-of-battle-to-save-berkhamsted-common-1-7006636 | title=Exhibition and commemorative walk marks anniversary of battle to save Berkhamsted Common | publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd. | work=Hemel Gazette | date=12 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Lubbock72.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882.]]By the mid 19th century, much of [[UK|Britain's]] unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like [[William Greenwell]] excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, [[Stonehenge]] came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the [[London and South-Western Railway]] as the monument was "not the slightest use to anyone now"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill]] and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[William Gladstone]] of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]]. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]]. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] was founded by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designer [[William Morris]] to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the [[National Trust]] in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill. "At Home: A Short History of Private Life" Transworld Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910|1910]].

[[File:Tattershall Castle, 2006.jpg|left|200px|upright|thumbnail|[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], preserved at personal expense by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and a catalyst for [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913|broader heritage protection laws]].]]
[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]], a medieval [[manor house]] had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of [[India]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468|title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house|publisher=BBC News Magazine|author=Denise Winterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite book|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Trust====
{{one source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] was founded in 1894 by [[Octavia Hill]], [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley]] as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and [[Tenement (law)|tenements]] (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/download-national-trust-acts-1907-1971-post-order-2005.pdf | title=The National Trust Acts  1907 - 1971, as varied by a Parliamentary Scheme implemented by  The Charities (National Trust) Order 2005 | publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] | accessdate=10 November 2017 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]]. Its first archaeological monument was [[White Barrow]]. The focus on [[English country house|country houses]] and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group [[the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings]], which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphb.org.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings (SPHB)|publisher=sphb.org.uk|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Heritage====
[[English Heritage]] formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Era for English Heritage|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/new-era-for-englands-heritage1|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are [[Stonehenge]], [[Dover Castle]], [[Tintagel Castle]] and the best preserved parts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], officially titled the [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]], that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties.&lt;ref name="EH History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: [[Historic England]], which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new [[English Heritage Trust]], a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph EHT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Does our history have a future in the hands of the English Heritage Trust?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11441254/Does-our-history-have-a-future-in-the-hands-of-the-English-Heritage-Trust.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the
[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site]], in [[Newburgh, New York]]. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Diane. "America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals."

[[Charles E.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]] led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, ''Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons &amp; Lapham'', Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Scott S.

The US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], another privately funded [[non-profit organization]], began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide "leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities" according to the Trust's mission statement.  In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in [[northern Virginia]]. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the [[cultural diversity]] of American history.  In New York City, the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation "from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an international level, the New York-based [[World Monuments Fund]] was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

===Canada===
{{Main|Heritage conservation in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the phrase "heritage preservation" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. "Conservation" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|central government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[Victor de Stuers]] is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/stuersv|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Stuers was  appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind ''[[Monumentenzorg]]'' (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the ''[[Rijksmuseum]]'' (National Museum) and the ''Rijksarchief'' (National Archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerkindenhaag.nl/agendaberichten/victor-de-stuers-vader-van-monumentenzorg-en-rijksmuseum/|title=Victor de Stuers, vader van Monumentenzorg en Rijksmuseum - Kerk in Den Haag|website=www.kerkindenhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/stuers|title=Stuers, jhr.

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the [[:nl:Monumentenwet|''Monumentenwet'']] (“Monuments Act”) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and “which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value” and must thus be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/till014sche01_01/till014sche01_01_0031.php|title=J.A.C.

In 1973, the NGO ''Monumentenwacht'' (“Monument Watch”) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/migrated-reports/629_1.pdf|title=Devlin, H. (2005). European initiatives in preventative maintenance for historic buildings. Retrieved from www.wcmt.org.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of heritage buildings can subscribe to the services of Monumentenwacht and receive regular visits for inspection. The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Martin E. |authorlink=Martin E. Weaver |title=Historic Preservation Maintenance in the Netherlands: The Monumentenwacht |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=18 |issue=18 |date=1986 |pages=10-11 |doi=10.2307/1494114 |jstor=1494114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24|title=Flood Risk Management in Europe|first1=L.M.|last1=Bouwer|first2=P.|last2=Vellinga|date=20 October 2018|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=469–484|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole&lt;/ref&gt; shipwrecks from [[Dutch East India Company|The Dutch East India Company]] are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nuSwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=monumentenwet+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4JlsRABjN&amp;sig=wZoBBeGGK6nlqU1VABsCB6PPbfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrruD1h67XAhWEl5QKHZP_CjsQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=monumentenwet%201961&amp;f=false|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: National Perspectives in Light of the UNESCO Convention 2001 - Second Edition|last=Dromgoole|first=Sarah|date=2006-06-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047410454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
In Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/Law%20on%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf “Закон за заштита на културното наследство” (PDF)]. „Сл. Весник на Република Македонија“ бр.20/04. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this Law was the first nation-wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since the Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The “Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia” has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to “National office for protection of cultural monuments”, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to “National center for conservation” and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, Biljana.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] established their branch in Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org.mk/AboutUs.aspx “ICOMOS Macedonia About Us”]. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum - Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the Institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The Institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzejohrid.mk/istorija “Историја”]. НУ Завод за Заштита на Спомениците на Културата и Музеј - Охрид. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001881/188172eo.pdf "Cultural Heritage in South-East Europe: Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of)" (PDF)].

=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, [[Antiquities Law of the State of Israel of 1978|Antiquities Law of the State of Israel]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000490|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planning and Building Law (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1998/Pages/Planning%20and%20Building%20Law-%201965.aspx|title=Summay of the law in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]].

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000613|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yossi Klein Halevi|Klein Halevi, Yossi]] (2011). [http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=96782691#6.2693.6.default האמרקניזציה של תל אביב].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel’s historic situations and are aligned with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.shimur.org/viewStaticPage.aspx?pageID=258|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council used to operate under the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]] but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimur.org/viewArticle.aspx?articleID=165|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites: Historical context on the Council's work and outline of future plans [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/building/engineering/Pages/preservation.aspx The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include [[Knights Templar]] sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

A historic district in the [[United States]] is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, [[Contributing property|contributing]] and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] designates historic districts through the [[U.S. Department of Interior]], under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]]. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015030933/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}, TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service.

These include "Main Street" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.&lt;ref name="rdp"&gt;[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=IND20529991 Stenberg, Peter L.

In 1835, the English poet [[William Wordsworth]] described the [[Lake District]] as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of [[United States National Park|National Parks]], areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The department of the interior designated several areas of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the [[Morristown National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/morr/ |title=Morristown National Historical Park - Morristown National Historical Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] the [[ambassador]] to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the [[Ramblers' Association]] and other groups led to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

== UNESCO ==
According to UNESCO’s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as [[World Heritage Site]]s. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of “cultural heritage”. According to Article 1 of the Convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites “which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science” are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the Convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage convention’s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/ The World Heritage Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt; is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the Convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The Committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/ All available reports of the Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential challenges ==
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/papers/w20446.pdf)%20(http://readings.sipx.com/in-efa1d268-3446-11e4-b0d4-22000a890e29/c-a5bb0b99-34dc-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b/x-18c7cf2c-4b0a-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b.pdf?Expires=1510044499&amp;Signature=OYOvpPRjsvsdxGk8mFJuuvpqTmeZ2aWRa5PyPPJ3HEyNSDr36kObybQETDowEcAnOP10WnB82VVejixBL~YiqGuKe6ZJ-fFchJ2tcVcrt4A7QNKhALWi1jE0z2XkqC8tZxb6picEAwMJ3MhUCtEHoA8-kajtxQQaA9QgAjfzX~4_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIVBE35QX7A7QYJEA|title=Preserving History or Hindering Growth? The Heterogeneous Effects of Historic Districts on Local Housing Markets in New York City|last=Been, Gould Ellen, Gedal, Glaeser, &amp; McCabe|first=Vicki, Ingrid, Michael, Edward, Brian J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2012). The politics and heritage of race and space in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In D. F. Ruggles (Ed.), ''On location'' (pp. 37–59). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From “No”: Straight Talk to Local Advocates. ''Forum Journal'' 30(2), 46-49.

==Careers==
Although volunteers continue to play a large role in historic preservation activities, the field has seen an increased level of professionalization. Today, there are many career options in historic preservation in the public, non-profit and private sectors. Institutes of secondary education (universities, colleges, etc.) in the United States offer both certificate and degree ([[Associate in Applied Science|A.A.S]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[Masters of Design Studies|M.D.S]], [[Master of Historic Preservation|M.H.P.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) programs in historic preservation. Some pupils—at schools with such programmes available—choose to enroll in "joint degree" programs, earning a degree in historic preservation along with one in another, related subject, often an [[Master of Architecture|MArch]], [[Master of Urban Planning|MUP]] or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree.

Possible career fields include:
;Architectural conservator: Focus specifically on the physical conservation of building materials.
;Architectural historian/historian: Primarily researches and writes statements expressing the historical significance of sites.
;Historic preservation planner: Most are employed by local, county, state or federal government planning agencies to administer tax abatement programs, ensure compliance with local ordinances and state and Federal legislation, and conduct design reviews to ensure that proposed projects will not harm historic and archaeological resources. At the state level, they are known as a [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] while at other levels of government they may be known as a Federal or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer. Some may also serve as consultants to local governments, conducting [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990|Section 106]] reviews in accordance with the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]].
;Preservation architect: Design and develop architectural conservation plans and work specifications in consultation with Engineers, Historians and Planners, ensuring compliance with local design guidelines to protect sensitive historic building fabric. Most are employed by private architecture firms though some find work with government agencies.
;Preservation craftsperson/[[Traditional trades|traditional trades practitioner]]: Employs knowledge of traditional building techniques and contemporary conservation technologies to complete the conservation, repair or restoration of historic buildings.
;Preservation engineer: Work with Architects to devise conservation solutions of a structural or material -specific nature. Most are employed by private architecture and/or engineering firms.
;[[Public historian]]/[[Heritage interpretation|resource interpreters]]: Most are employed by government agencies and private foundations to interpret the significance of historic resources for the general public.
;[[Historic site|Historic site administrator]]
;Non-profit sector careers: Engage in a variety of activities concerned with historic preservation advocacy, easements, and private foundations at the local, regional, statewide, or national levels.

'''Historical ecology''' is a research program that focuses on the interactions between [[human]]s and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, C. L. (1987). Historical ecology. In ''Regional dynamics: Burgundian landscapes in historical perspective'', eds. C. L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt, pp. 237-264. New York:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Scholl, Michael D., D. Seth Murray and Carole L. Crumley
2010 Comparing trajectories of climate, class and production: an historical ecology of American yeoman. In ''Environmental Social Sciences: Methods and Research Design''. pp. 322-348. Ismael Vaccaro, Eric Alden Smith, and Shankar Aswani, editors, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to ''and'' shape the environment, continuously contributing to [[landscape]] transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.&lt;ref name="Balee1"&gt;Balée, W. (1998). "Historical ecology: Premises and postulates". In W. Balée (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 13-29). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, Carole L.

1994. Historical Ecology:a Multidimensional Ecological Orientation. In Historical Ecology: Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes, ed. C.L. Crumley, pp. 1-16. Santa Fe: School  of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from [[geography]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, [[ethnography|ethnographic interviews]], and landscape reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.]] used the term in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1964 | title = General and historical ecology | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 14 | issue = 7| pages = 33–35 | doi=10.2307/1293234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe a methodology that had been in long development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1944 | title = Analysis and Mexican archaeology: an attempt to apply the method | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.2307/275110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deevey wished to bring together the practices of "general ecology" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a "historical ecology" which relied on  evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used [[radiocarbon dating]] to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of [[material culture]] and sites discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1969 | title = Coaxing history to conduct experiments | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 40–43 | doi=10.2307/1294629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, members of the history department at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] organized a lecture series entitled "Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change"&lt;ref&gt;Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures,  personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:

E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central [[Petén District]] of [[Guatemala]] to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = D. | last2 = Rice | first2 = P. | year = 1984 | title = Lessons from the Maya | url = | journal = Latin American Research Review | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 7–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of [[Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt (1987) ''Regional Dynamics: Burgundian Landscapes in Historical Perspective''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faeroes]], and [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, T. 1981.

Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:

Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines [[Massachusetts]], USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Alexander | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Leavenworth | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Cooper | first5 = A.B. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = M.G. | year = 2005 | title = The history of ocean resources: modeling cod biomass using historical records | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0078:thoorm]2.0.co;2 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the [[Florida Keys]], USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology (2008–present) seeks to collect relevant historical data on fishing, whaling, and trade of the furs of aquatic animals in order form a baseline for environmental restorations of the [[California]], USA coast.&lt;ref&gt;Selbie, Hugo (2008) Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology Phase 1: Historical Sources Survey Report.

==Relations with other disciplines==

[[File:Idaho Falls Idaho Temple 2.jpeg|thumb|Manmade nature: In [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones]]
Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of [[environmental anthropology]]. Western scholars have known since the time of [[Plato]] that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the [[Great Chain of Being]], or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was [[environmental determinism]], developed by geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]]. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of [[Franz Boas]] which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. [[Julian Steward]]'s [[cultural ecology]] is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.

Anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]] introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from [[systems ecology]]. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.&lt;ref name="balee2"&gt;Balée, W. (2006). "The research program of historical ecology". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revisions of anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].

==Landscapes in historical ecology==

In historical ecology, the [[landscape]] is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment.  The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology revises the notion of the [[ecosystem]] and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers "landscape transformation" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; The use of "landscape" instead of "ecosystem" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.

[[File:Carl O. Sauer.jpg|thumb|left|Geographer Carl O. Sauer]]
Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words ''landskift'', ''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'' refer to environments that have been altered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, W.'', 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes''. Inkata Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.B., 1986, "The vernacular landscape", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. &amp; D. Lowenthal, ''Landscape Meanings and Values'', Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P.E. | year = 1934 | title = The terminology of regional description | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 78–79 | doi=10.1080/00045603409357125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.&lt;ref name=Olwig&gt;Olwig, K (2002). ''Landscape, nature, and the body politic''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also "forms of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Carol. 1991. ''On Site: Architectural Preoccupations.'' Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer [[Carl Sauer]]. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenzer | first1 = M. S. | year = 1985 | title = Milieu and the 'intellectual landscape': Carl O. Sauer's undergraduate heritage | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 258–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1985.tb00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as [[landscape ecology]]. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = M. G. | year = 2005 | title = Landscape ecology in North America: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = 8| pages = 1967–1974 | doi=10.1890/04-0890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as [[palimpsest]]s, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.

Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts.  Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous [[slash-and-burn]] horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.

Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denevan | first1 = William | year = 1992 | title = The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492 | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 369–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sluyter, Andrew (2002) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_landscape.html?id=XA6R9UG2WxQC ''Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications'']. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to [[industrialization]]. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like [[foragers]] and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). "The morphology of landscape." In J. Leighly (Ed.), ''Land and Life'' (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-mediated disturbance==

[[File:Dalbek P1210001.JPG|thumb|Man-made irrigation canal]]
''Homo sapiens'' have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

Both destructive and at times constructive, [[anthropogenic fire]] is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, S. J. (1998). "Forged in fire: History, land, and anthropogenic fire". In W. Balée (Ed.), ''Advances in Historical Ecology'', (pp 64-103). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have practiced [[controlled burn]]s of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of "ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions."&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

[[Invasive species|Biological invasions]] and the spread of [[pathogen]]s and [[disease]]s are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.

Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include [[water management]] and [[soil management]]. In [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Cicero]] noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; At present, [[fertilization]] yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.

===Anthropogenic fire===

Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt; The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years.  Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.

Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.

[[File:SwiddenFire6.jpg|thumb|A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn]]
In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt;

In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt;

Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt; Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.

===Biological invasions===
[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Chenille.jpg|thumb|''Lymantria dispar'']]
Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.

Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.

One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate [[Eurasia]]; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an [[entomologist]] in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. "Gypsy Moth." pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions'', University of California Press, Berkeley, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.

===Epidemic disease===
[[File:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites.]]
A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are [[Host (biology)|hosts]] for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as [[chronic diseases]]. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"&gt;Newson, L.A. (1998) "A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease." In W. Balee (Ed.). ''Advances in historical ecology'' (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in [[pathogenic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"/&gt;

===Transformation of waterways===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amazonia5.jpg |thumb|Satellite view of anthropogenic transformation of [[Amazon basin]] waterways near the city of Manaus, Brazil along the north bank of the Negro River, 11 miles (18 km) above its confluence with the Amazon]] --&gt;

Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of [[western culture|western civilization]]. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil [[erosion]] and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. [[Landscape]]s, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (1992). ''So shall you reap''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for [[agricultural]] or transportation usage.

The evidence for past and present agricultural use of [[wetlands]] in [[Mesoamerica]] suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and [[waterway]] alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Surian | first1 = N. | last2 = Rinaldi | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Morphological response to river engineering and management in alluvial channels in Italy | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 307–326 | doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(02)00219-2| bibcode = 2003Geomo..50..307S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pre-Columbian]], indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, T. M. &amp; Turner, B. L. II. (1992). "Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest." ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 82 (3), 402-425. {{jstor|2563353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro]]

Historical ecologists view the [[Amazon basin]] landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The [[Amazon River]] has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape?
http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[waterway]] transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic [[savanna]] peoples of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon built an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish [[weir]]s in the savanna of [[Baures]], Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = C. L. | year = 2000 | title = An artificial landscape-scale fishery in the Bolivian Amazon | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/%7Ecerickso/fishweir/articles/Nature1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 190–193 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..190E | doi = 10.1038/35041555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in [[Igarapé]] [[Guariba]] in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British [[naturalists]] [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long across fields thick with tall [[papyrus]] grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of [[Amapá]] was dramatically transformed.&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of waterways. The [[Sumer]]ians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in [[erosion]] which impacted the landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). "Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]." ''Geographical Review'', 73 (2), 166-181 {{jstor|214642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, B. &amp; Smith, T. (2007, October 15). "Reviving a river." Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other [[ecological]] settings, as places where [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] populations have dealt with the forces of [[nature]]. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], not a [[society]]. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of both [[waterways]] and [[landscapes]].&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

===Soil management===

[[Soil management]], or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local [[biodiversity]]. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in [[topsoil]]. Salinization of the [[Euphrates River]] has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Erickson, C. &amp; Balée, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.

The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or [[Terra preta]], are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt; Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of [[charcoal]] in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universität Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |archivedate=2005-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed [[slash-and-char]]. In contrast to the commonly known [[slash-and-burn]] technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.&lt;ref name=sington&gt;Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DirkvdM santa fe scorched.jpg|thumb|Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture]]
Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Putting the Carbon back: Black is the new green | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = | pages = 624–626 | doi=10.1038/442624a | pmid=16900176| bibcode = 2006Natur.442..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, J. &amp; Leach, M. (1996). ''Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.&lt;ref name=sington/&gt;  The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.

==Applied historical ecology==

Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines.   Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Historical contingencies in the coevolution of environment and livelihood: contributions to the debate on Amazon Black Earth | url = http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/875/14Exemplary(A).pdf | format = PDF | journal = Geoderma | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 307–331 | doi=10.1016/s0016-7061(02)00270-7 | bibcode=2003Geode.111..307G}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.

Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. [[Conservation biology]] recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. [[Restoration ecology]] restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) ''Fundamentals of Conservation Biology''. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.

A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples.  The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robichaud | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = A.

The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. "Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley."

By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyke | first1 = E.V. | last2 = Wasson | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Historical Ecology of a Central California Estuary: 150 Years of Habitat Change | url = http://www.elkhornslough.org | journal = Estuaries | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 173–189 | doi=10.1007/bf02732853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further suggested using techniques that "imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats."

'''Indigenous psychology''' is defined by Kim and Berry (1993) as "the scientific study of human behavior or mind that is native, that is not transported from other regions, and that is designed for its people." Indigenous psychology generally advocates examining [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s and [[belief]]s people have about themselves and studying them in their natural contexts. Theories, concepts and methods are developed to correspond with psychological phenomena. Indigenous psychology explicitly advocates for incorporating both the content and the context of research. Indigenous psychology is considered necessary since existing psychological theories are not necessarily universal, and may often represent the psychology and cultural traditions of Europe and North America. 
"Indigenous psychology seeks to discover how the cultural views, theories, assumptions and classifications coupled with overarching social institutions influence psychological topics in each respective culture (2007). Indigenous psychologies are rooted in the systematic influences of formal, political and educational institutions as well as social factors that have and will continue to change the state of psychology. These psychologies grow out of the basic, political, economic, religious, and social components of each culture (Lawson, Graham and Baker, 2007). Indigenous psychologies usually use two distinct categories of psychological knowledge; scientific and applied knowledge reflected in scientific and professional psychology. Many indigenous countries prioritize these two categories usually based on the application of psychological knowledge to overcome challenges facing their culture, such as strengthening education, employment, health, population control and religious conflict rather than attempting to fund new scientific research with limited resources (2007).

== The indigenous psychology movement ==

Kim, [[Yang Kuo-shu|Yang]] and Hwang (2006) distinguish 10 characteristics of indigenous psychology. 
#It emphasizes examining psychological phenomena in ecological, historical and cultural context. 
#Indigenous psychology needs to be developed for all cultural, native and ethnic groups. 
#It advocates use of multiple methods. 
#It advocates the integration of "insiders, "outsiders" and multiple perspectives to obtain comprehensive and integrated understanding. 
#It acknowledges that people have a complex and sophisticated understanding of themselves and it is necessary to translate their practical and episodic understanding into analytical knowledge. 
#It is part of a scientific tradition that advocates multiple perspectives, but not multiple psychologies or absolute relativism.
#Although descriptive analysis is the starting point of research, its final goal is to discover psychological universals that can be theoretically and empirically [[Formal verification|verified]]. 
#It is a part of the cultural sciences tradition in which human agency, meaning and context are incorporated into the research design. 
#It advocates a linkage of [[humanities]] (which focus on human experience and creativity) with [[social sciences]] (which focus empirical analysis and verification). 
#Two starting points of research in indigenous psychology can be identified: indigenization from without and indigenization from within.

Although there is debate within the indigenous psychology movement about whether indigenous psychology represents a more universalistic or a more relativistic approach (Chakkarath, 2012), most of these 10 characteristics are advocated by the majority of those in the indigenous psychology movement.

Political and economic instability has greatly hindered the development of psychology as a science in Latin America, South Africa, and Indian-Asian Psychology. This problem is a phenomenon that is present across the majority of non-northwestern indigenous psychologies, creating unstable societies (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;436).

Lack of national capital creates a shortage in influential professional fields like psychology and propagates the science of the leading countries. Nations such as the United States, that flourish economically, affect the poorer and less flourishing countries, and in doing so interject their western ideologies the indigenous nations with whom they trade. (Allwood and Berry 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;248) note six sources of influence on the development of global indigenous psychologies:

#changes in developing countries in the 1970s stimulated [[endogenous]] and indigenous rethinking about their social and economic conditions by social and behavioral scientists;
#their dissatisfaction with what they had learned from Western disciplines for solving problems of their homelands;
#their growing dissatisfaction with the unquestioned, imitative, and explicative nature of psychological research that is deeply rooted in Western psychology;
#self-reflection on their own social and cultural characteristics that were beyond Western psychological construction;
#the awareness by some Western psychologists that the nature of psychology was ‘monocultural,’ ‘Euro-American,’ and ‘indigenous psychology of the West’; and
#the parochial and insular stands of Western psychology, which disregarded the interests and research done in other countries and languages.

Each individual indigenous culture maintains their own emic explanations for, and solutions to, their own psychological and behavioral issues. Western psychology needs to shift over and learn to understand the indigenous cultures in their own setting, as Allwood and Berry state, "…the science has a dual responsibility: to understand people in their own terms (IP), and to search for general principles of human behavior. The development of an IP is valuable in its own right, but they may also collectively serve as building blocks in creating a more general psychology." (Allwood, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;265)

In South Africa, specifically, [[apartheid]] was a major downfall for their psychology. This period in time intentionally neglected and isolated the field of psychology. "…in 1948 the Afrikaner National Party gained power and created the system of apartheid to maintain control over the country’s social, economic, and political system" (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438).

In the India-Asian psychology, there are three strands of psychology which are defined by Rao (1988) "…to be general psychology…that has universal relevance and application…country and region-specific psychology…the study of geographically bound persons…and native based weltanschauung psychology…driven by the understanding of geographically bound persons yet…highly theoretical or philosophical component" (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;441).

In order for these different countries to better focus their psychological stand points different programs need to instituted and more persons need to become involved in becoming psychologists. "The current and future states of… indigenous psychologies, require the sustained growth of their scientific research base at the same pace as their applied professional interventions" (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;441).

Indigenous psychologies can be alike when they include two different categories of psychological knowledge, explicitly, scientific and applied knowledge reflected in scientific and professional psychology. Each indigenous psychology prioritizes the two in a distinctive way. Trends do exist between more industrialized nations such as the United States. Challenges arise when trying to achieve a successful applied psychology in a culture. One challenge is finding adequate resources. Another challenge is shaping the practice of psychology to suit the circumstances a new culture. It is important to be able to understand the difference between indigenous psychologies and psychological specialties. Psychological specialties include such topics of study lifespan developmental psychology, health psychology, organizational psychology, and social psychology. Indigenous psychologies are culturally specific, and aim to describe, explain, or predict psychological phenomena from within a given culture's worldview.

Indigenous psychology, as defined by Heelas and Lock (1981), consists of the cultural views, theories, classifications and assumptions coupled with the overarching social institutions that influence psychological topics in each respective culture. (Lawson, Graham, Baker, 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;435) While indigenous psychologies have existed for a long time, only recently have they been studied in the context of global psychology.
While international psychology influences indigenous psychology, it is within each indigenous psychology that the unique histories, social mores, needs and practicalities of a certain culture can be addressed. For example, many Indian psychologists with Western training have incorporated their instruction to include aspects of Indian culture that aren’t necessarily relevant to Western psychology. They have learned to place more emphasis on extended family and community which is more suited to the societal norms of Indian culture than Western culture. (Lawson, Graham, Baker, 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;440)
Western European and American psychologies have historically had the resources to advance psychology both in the applied fields and scientifically. This has not been the case for many indigenous psychologies. For example, in India, where the population is well over one billion, as of 2005 there were only seventy universities teaching psychology. The lack of trained professionals and the demands of an impoverished population have left psychologists in India struggling to meet the needs of its citizens. This has often taken priority over scientific advancement.

Indigenous psychology is useful for studying the impact of political, economic, religious, and social aspects on a specific society. South Africa for example, has been in political and racial turmoil for decades if not centuries, enduring violence and apartheid. Development of indigenous psychology as a focus can limit influence of western concepts and encourage cultivation of socially appropriate methods for the area. According to Lawson, Graham, and Baker (2007), South African psychology should address specific issues related to apartheid such as violence, poverty, racism, and HIV/AIDS to overcome social unrest. Other issues that should also be addressed include addressing the lingering individual trauma associated with apartheid and using a more inclusionary theory versus the exclusionary policies of past psychologies (p.&amp;nbsp;439).
It is important to understand the importance of globalization when exploring indigenous psychologies. In article from the Monitor (May 2006), the APA Senior Director of International Affairs, Merry Bullock discusses globalization of psychology. The article defines globalization as the movement of people and knowledge across borders in the attempt to establish common goals and to develop a homogenized world view of psychology (p.&amp;nbsp;9). According to Lawson, Graham, and Baker (2007); "The challenge facing global psychology is trying to find a way to integrate psychology with culture for a more complete understanding of the Human affective, behavioral and cognitive systems" (p.&amp;nbsp;434).

Globalization is also linked to indigenous psychology. In the globalization of psychology there is the hope that Western psychological ideals can be integrated with indigenous psychologies in order to address specific needs of particular countries and/or cultures. Bullock of the APA addresses the opportunities of incorporating Western psychological ideals with ingenious psychologies when she writes: 
"Globalization offers a tremendous opportunity for psychology to enrich its content, methods and scope. Like all opportunities, however, this must be nurtured, and it must be addressed by open discussion about how to do it. Although we might all agree that it is important to keep an inquiring mind, to share and learn as well as to inform and teach, we also know that our cognitive and social systems make this difficult to implement. To do so, we need strategic and open discussion about assumptions and biases, and we need collaborative interaction to seek a common set of psychological principles" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).
The future of psychology is expanding worldwide contributing to the formation of psychologies tailored to fit each culture around the world yet linked to an evolving global psychology." (Lawson, Graham and, Baker p.435) Understanding indigenous psychologies and finding a way to incorporate them into already established psychological knowledge will positively change the field of psychology.

While it is important and necessary that we find a way for indigenous psychologies and global psychologies to mix, we must be careful that assimilation or its predecessors not follow as a result of our desire to mix differing cultural ideals. "Assimilation refers to those processes whereby groups with distinctive identities become culturally and socially fused." (Hughes, p.&amp;nbsp;222) When assimilation occurs it forces the structural context of a society to change often forcing its cultural traditions to undergo a new development. Assimilation occurs most often when a dominant group and less controlling group interact. While it provides a way for better social interaction and communication to happen it is often the cause of one culture losing its traditions and original beliefs.

Related to indigenous psychology is a field called [[critical psychology]]. This branch of psychology investigates how and why psychology focuses on the individual and disregards power differentials, social, and racial impacts on psychopathology. This branch may be applicable specifically in South Africa due to the apartheid. Authors Painter and Terre Blanche (2004) analyze critical psychology and compare it to what they call mainstream psychology. They describe steps being taken to apply social, political, economical, and racial influences to the field in South Africa and a concern for psychology in South Africa mirroring psychology in the UK and US which would be counter-productive. The advocacy of using social influences in South African society by Painter and Terre Blanche supports the effort to apply indigenous psychology in the area. Further application of indigenous psychology or similar methods will contribute to the field of global psychology.

== Indigenous psychologies ==

Three things are in common with indigenous societies including a shortage of resources, professional vs. scientific priority of psychology and the challenge of integrating psychology with culture. 
Indigenous psychologies practice applied psychology over research psychology. They often lack financial support and resources for research psychology. They end to focus on the application of psychological knowledge to overcome challenges facing their country such as strengthening education, employment, health, population control, ethnic and religious conflicts rather than allocating limited resources to expand research psychology. With indigenous psychologies they have evolved more as a profession than a science. 
Instability of a country greatly hinders the development of psychology.Indigenous psychologies may be influenced by western psychology but develop it to better fit their culture.

===Native American psychology===

The concept of "parallel lives" is a useful one for understanding more recent Native American experience so as to better understand how Native American indigenous ways of knowing have been impacted by historical events following the arrival of European and other settlers to the North American continent. Ed Edmo, a well-known Native American storyteller, author, and poet, comparing his experience of the deliberate flooding of Celilo Falls near The Dalles, Oregon in order to build a dam with that of his friend Lani Roberts, a European-American, writes: "our lives were lived in parallel fashion because of the differences in our ethnic heritage," and "we grew up in the same geographical space but lived in radically different worlds" as a result of the "profound racism" that Native people have suffered (Xing, 173-4).

An excellent resource for better understanding Native American Psychology in terms of pathology stemming in large part from the traumas inflicted on Native American peoples as a result of their contact with European settlers, is Harold Napoleon’s slim but powerful book Yuuyaraq: The Way of the Human Being. Harold Napoleon is a [[Yup'ik]] Eskimo who wrote his book to try to make sense of the profound sadness of his people, and to understand how he came to cause the death of his own son as a result of alcohol abuse. In the book, Harold suggests that his people were suffering from a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the "Great Death" in which his culture and people were nearly wiped out by disease and other traumatic experiences resulting from contact with European settlers. He further suggests that denial, nallunguarluku, literally ‘pretending it didn’t happen,’ has become something of a cultural trait, one manifestation of which is difficulty in talking about painful circumstances…which can lead to alienation, anger, and self-destructive behavior that some people seek to numb with alcohol" (Napoleon, viii).

Napoleon writes: "Yuuyaraq (the way of the human being) encompassed the spirit world in which the Yup'ik lived. It outlined the way of living in harmony with this spirit world and with the spirit beings which inhabited this world" (Napoleon, 5). Despite the traumas inflicted on Native peoples, from the Great Death(s) to the forced migration and relocation of the Trail of Tears and reservation life, this connection to spirit is something which Native Americans have in common with other racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States, such as African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino/Hispanic Americans which all "place strong emphasis on the interplay and interdependence of spiritual life and healthy functioning" (Sue, 226). While in the West, "incorporating religion in the rational decision-making process or in the conduct of therapy has generally been seen as unscientific and unprofessional," such spiritual "indigenous healing methods are beginning to be seen as having much to offer Western forms of mental health practice (Sue, 225). These contributions are valuable "not only because multiple belief systems now exist in our society, but also because counseling and psychotherapy have historically neglected the spiritual dimension of human existence (Sue, 228). It is certain that Western psychology has much to learn from pathological as well as positive psychological traits associated with specific indigenous psychological experiences and ways of knowing.

In the interest of bridging the gap between contemporary forms of therapy and traditional non-Western indigenous healing, Derald Wing Sue and David Sue propose the following 7 guidelines for Western-trained therapists in dealing with clients of non-Western and indigenous cultures:

#Do not invalidate the indigenous belief systems of your culturally diverse clients.
#Become knowledgeable about indigenous beliefs and healing practices.
#Realize that learning about indigenous healing and beliefs entails experiential and lived realities.
#Avoid overpathologizing and underpathologizing a culturally diverse client’s problems.
#Be willing to consult with traditional healers or make use of their services.
#Recognize that spirituality is an intimate aspect of the human condition and a legitimate aspect of mental health work.
#Be willing to expand your definition of the helping role to community work and involvement. (Sue, 229-30)

Another important contributor to Native American indigenous psychology, was Rupert Ross (1992, 2006). Although in Canada, Ross’ efforts remain relevant to many Native American cultures, especially in Alaska. Ross (1992, 2006) who, while working as a Crown Attorney with First Nations went beyond the confines of the current criminal justice system to explore the aboriginal people who were forced to adhere to it.

Ross (1992) found physiological and psychological differences that prevented aboriginal people proper justice. The ethics of non-interference, that anger not be shown, respecting praise and gratitude, the conservation-withdrawal tactic, and the notion that the time must be right were rules that guided traditional time (Ross, 1992, 13-44). Although assimilating to a degree, Ross (1992) suggested that perhaps there were areas of knowledge from them that our nation could learn from (Ross, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;75-77). Even the western scientific method of studying cause of effect differed, as the First Nation believed that humans should not give cause, hence should have no effect on their environment (Ross, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;75-77). Ross (1992, 2006) wrote two books on the subject, entitled Dancing With a Ghost: Exploring Aboriginal Reality and Returning to the Teaching: Exploring Aboriginal Justice.

===Latin American psychology===

The Latin American Community has been attempting to rectify their current status, even if it has been a challenge for the professionals in the field of Psychology in Latin America. 
"Fortunately, recent developments in social issues such as population control, economic development, community psychology (Freire, 1970), national psychology (Diaz-Guerrero, 1984) and child development (Recagno 1982). Applied interventions will ultimately be enhanced from these and other lines of research, providing a more systematic method for addressing the affective, behavioral and cognitive psychological systems of member of a particular culture." (Baker, Graham, Lawson and Robert 2007) In the areas that are often looked upon as being problematic for individuals and the Latin American societies, there has been progress in research. It does help some, for American psychologists to continue these studies in America as well. The demographics may be different, however many cultural aspects continue to affect the Latin American population in America today. Those issues are in need of elaboration.
Latin America has come a long way when it comes to indigenous psychologies because they basically had to jump through loopholes when they faced democracy. They have experienced people who worked in the field that were killed because of what they were studying, which is psychology. Along with the hardship of losing their teachers they didn’t have funding when they needed it to expand. By working together, people of Latin America can make it happen by sticking together and get this field of study back up on its feet again (pg 436-437).

“Latin American psychology has developed as a profession faster than it has as a science” (Baker, Graham, Lawson and Robert 2007) In Latin America there is a high social demand for professional psychologists which is what has helped fuel the need for psychology. Research is especially needed in Latin America because of the constant changing of their social and economic conditions (437). Research in Latin America has recently become implemented in order to help with population control, economic development, and community psychology (Freire, 1970). Liberation psychology which came about in the 19th century was the original attempt to focus on issues such as overcrowding, land reform, and violence (437). Martin Baro defined liberation psychology as “a paradigm in which theories don’t define the problems of the situation; rather, the problems demand or select their own theorization” (Martin-Baro, 1989). Many countries have since taken on this theory and thus created all of the unique indigenous psychologies.

===Indian-Asian psychology===

Indian-Asian psychology, like South African and Latin American psychology, suffers "from a lack of resources stemming from the political and economic instability of both [India and Asia]" (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Though it is true that Indian ad Asian (especially Chinese) psychologies were initially very influenced by European and American psychology, local "social, religious, and philosophical pressures and beliefs" have since affected the psychology of the region in huge ways (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439).

Formal institutions both cultivated and oppressed psychology in the India-Asia region (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439). Turbulent and shaky are good words to describe the political atmosphere that these regions endured, which of course was reflected in the field of psychology. The "lack of intellectual infrastructure as a result of scarce financial resources" (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439) was most certainly felt by specific areas, which in turn led to "impoverished sociocultural context and centralized government control of resources" (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;440).

What can be said for psychology in the region is persistence. Even though there are twenty four native languages (each one having various dialects), and even though psychology has only been in the formal academic setting since the early twentieth century when Western psychology entered Calcutta, forward progress has nonetheless been made. Although the "region has neither an accreditation nor licensing system for psychology programs and practicing psychologist" (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;440), there are positive shifts occurring.

This shift can be seen in the relationship between applied psychology and research psychology. Thankfully, the shift from strictly applied professional psychology to scientific research psychology has begun to gain force (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439). It is also important to recognize the shift that has taken place between Western psychology and Indian-Asian psychology. Currently many with "formal Western training have molded their instruction to better fit their culture, thereby integrating cultural and traditional components into their practices" (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;440). Out of this, three different strand of psychology have developed that are specific to this particular region. They are general psychology, country- and region-specific psychology, and native-based weltanschauung psychology (Lawson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;441).
Indian-Asian people have had very strong ties to their culture and what is going on in their countries. They tend to look at how they have been doing things for many centuries and using it in all the different types of studies. Psychology is no different because they still look to their friends and family for input and advice on what needs to happen. They are very strong in their countries (pg 440).

===South African psychology===

According to Robert B. Lawson, Jean E. Graham, and Kristin M. Baker, psychology has been strongly influenced by the nation’s political turmoil, particularly over the past sixty years (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;437). Colonial, apartheid, capitalist, and patriarchal forces all influenced South African psychology, resulting in the formation of a psychology faced with adversity; the apartheid period intentionally neglected and isolated the field of psychology so that when South Africa first held democratic elections in the mid-1990s, the problems facing psychology as a science and profession were merely beginning to surface (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438).

South African psychology during the apartheid period was dominated by political influences, such as selective economic sanctions, segregation, and people being exiled from their native land; the influences of the apartheid period resulted in a grossly underdeveloped psychological field at the time of the fall of the apartheid (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). With approximately 5,000 psychologists for a population of over forty-three million people, practicing clinical psychologists greatly outnumber research psychologists, leaving few South African psychologists capable of crafting broad-scale psychological interventions (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Today, vast efforts are being made to extend South African psychology beyond its borders, which is mostly due to the apartheid no longer isolating the field form international scholarship (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438).

The first steps for South African psychology in the aftermath of apartheid were to take a more collectivist orientation, indigenous focus, rigorous scholarship, and international exchange (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). South African psychologists face the dilemma of keeping international influence and indigenous psychology in balance with South African perspectives; South Africa is in desperate need of psychologists that are willing and able to assist in overcoming the aftermath of apartheid, especially with issues such as violence, poverty, racism, and HIV/AIDS (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439).

While the resources available to South African psychologists are limited due to past apartheid constraints, measures are being taken to expand the number of psychologists trained to be basic researchers and field clinical psychologists (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439). Psychologists in South Africa race to respond to the social pressures and constraints placed on the field in the apartheid aftermath and there are now multiple efforts underway to develop South African psychology as both a profession and a science (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;439).
In South Africa, they had some tough times. They had to bring in their own as president and he has been working hard to get his country back on its feet after the apartheid. There were lots of racial issues that needed to be resolved and also the improving the people’s trains of thought. Psychology is one of their answers and they are working to get it going even it has taken a while (pg 438).

===South Africa, the apartheid system, and its effects on psychology===

With the apartheid system that was established in South Africa major turmoil was caused amongst native and non-native South Africans. The apartheid system was based on laws of segregation, which grew in severity as time passed. Some of the first segregation laws that were established did not allow for whites and "non-whites" to interact with each other. Even if these interactions wanted, whites and blacks were not allowed to marry or engage socially. In addition to this, "white jobs" and "black jobs" were established which also created segregation in the workplace (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). As apartheid progressed into its final stages, black South African citizens were no longer able to live in South Africa; they were sent back to African homelands causing them to lose their citizenship and be exiled (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Around 1990 the anti-apartheid era began, which helped to reintegrate blacks into the South African society. After receiving pressure from the United States and Great Britain, the apartheid system that once ruled South Africa started to become undone. The constitution in South Africa was rewritten in 1994, which helped usher in Nelson Mandela as the country’s political leader. With the country in his control, he completely outlawed any remainders of the apartheid system (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438).

While the apartheid system was still in place, South African psychology became extremely underdeveloped due to political power controlling everything in this society. There is little to no diversity amongst psychologists in South Africa. Not only are a majority of the practicing psychologists white, but most of them practice clinical psychology, rather than focusing on research (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438). This does not allow much of a chance for many psychological breakthroughs or findings to come out of South Africa. With the apartheid system abolished and a new democratic system in place, the education of psychology is being revamped improving the field greatly. More efforts are being made to encourage South Africans, especially blacks, to join the research field of psychology. Advocates are hoping their efforts will help to improve both basic and applied psychological research, and allow psychology in South Africa to branch out beyond itself (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;438).

===Filipino psychology===
{{Main|Filipino psychology}}

The Philippine experience has proven that approaching psychology using Western models cannot incorporate the intricacies of Asian cultures (Pe-Pua &amp; Protacio-Marcelino, 2000: 50). In addition, while many commentators have thought of [[Filipino psychology]] as a branch of Asian psychology, there is a continuing discussion on what comprise the subject. This will determine whether Filipino psychology is to be placed under the domain of either Asian psychology or Eastern psychology. 

Filipino psychology is seen as largely postcolonial and is seen as a kind of liberation psychology, aiming to be familiar with the psychology of subjugated communities by conceptually addressing the oppressive sociopolitical structure in which they exist (Tomaneng, 2015). The approaches ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''lapit'') in Filipino psychology are different from that of the West. In Filipino psychology, the subjects are treated as active participants to the research undertaking, called ''kalahok'', who are considered as equal in status to the researcher. The participants are included in the research as a group, and not as individuals - hence, an ''umpukan'', or natural cluster, is required to serve as the participants, per se. The researcher, who merely acts as a facilitator, is introduced to the ''umpukan'' by a ''tulay'' (bridge), who is also a part of the ''umpukan'' and is an esteemed member of the community being studied (Javier, 1996).

==Real life application==

Cultural views, theories and assumptions within social institutions influence cultures around the world through the application of psychological practices on indigenous populations. The historic, cultural and religious beliefs specific to each population directly affect the application of such psychologies. The specific beliefs of indigenous people must be considered in order to bridge the barrier between psychological ideas and the real world application of these ideas on indigenous people. An excerpt from an article on the American Psychological Associations web site explains this idea and shows how connecting psychology with cultural beliefs can strengthen a doctor patient relationship.

"Delhi psychologist Aruna Broota, PhD, doesn't let her doctoral training at an American university stand in the way of using Indian folk beliefs in her work. The importance of such beliefs were evident in a recent case in which one of Broota's patients beat his wife. Broota's probing revealed that the husband was angry at his wife for disobeying her mother-in-law by having her child immunized on a day the mother-in-law considered inauspicious. Broota's analysis? The women should have placed a small black mark behind the child's ear to protect him from evil."Pardon my saying so, but if there was a white therapist, he would try to be 'rational,'" says Broota, a psychology professor at the University of Delhi and editor of the Journal of Research and Applications in Clinical Psychology. "Whereas in India, we try to look into the belief system of the client. I was being ancient as well as modern to create peace in the house" (Clay, 2002)."

This article and many more are available on the APA web site http://www.apa.org/monitor/may02/india.aspx.

==DSM-IV-TR &amp; western diagnostic hegemony==

In addition to the broader dimensions of western colonial and cultural influence on indigenous psychologies, there are specific limitations for indigenous psychologies that arise from the pervasive (nearly universal) acceptance of western diagnostic tools as the primary source of diagnostic features/criteria for psychopathology (Thakker &amp; Ward, 1998: Poznyak, Reed, &amp; Clark, 2011). The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision [DMS-IV-TR] (2000), continues to be used as an overarching framework for mental illness across cultures, and may suppress or distort indigenous understandings of mental illness of psychopathological processes. By virtue of its culture-specific origin and oversight the DSM-IV-TR is culturally bound within western ontological paradigms, and thus may not be, in whole or in part, appropriate for the diverse needs of other cultures (Thakker &amp; Ward, 1998).

It is possible, and imperative, that indigenous psychologies find meaningful points of integration with western psychologies, and may include the systematic operationalization of mental illness within rigorous diagnostic criteria (Lawson, Graham, &amp; Baker, 2007). However, integration towards a global psychology, or other overarching cross-cultural framework of psychological phenomena transcendent of specific cultural ontologies may require the inclusion of paradigms and methodologies that exist apart from traditional western-scientific understandings of rigor. Moreover, diagnostic criteria will remain an important point of conversation and controversy for global psychology, as it jeopardizes the basic ability of researchers to generalize and categorize the prevalence/incidence of mental illness in a global context (Poznyak, Reed, &amp; Clark, 2011).

Internet sex addiction can have several causes according to the American Association for Sex Addition Therapy. The first cause is the neural physiological attachment that occurs during orgasms -  reinforcing and attaching the images or scenarios to the addictive behavior concurrently. Secondly, psychological defects like abandonment, unimportance or lack of genuine attachment are sometimes medicated by the instances of sex addiction behavior. Thirdly, the internet sex addict may be using the addiction to balance a legitimate chemical imbalance due to major depression, a bipolar disorder or a manic depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aasat.org/|title=SRT Training &amp; Certification {{!}} Sexual Recovery Therapist {{!}} AASAT|website=American Association for Sex Addiction Therapy|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cybersex addict may also struggle with [[intimacy anorexia]] since the cyber world feels safer than real relationships.

==General==

[[Cybersex]] addiction is a form of [[sexual addiction]] and [[Internet addiction disorder]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt; As a form of a [[compulsive behavior]], it can be identified by three criteria: the failure of making a decision about engagement in the behavior, obsession with the behavior, and the inability to stop the behavior despite negative consequences.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

Adults with this type of addiction, engage in at least one of the relevant behaviors. The majority of reasons why individuals experiment with such forms of sexual expression are diverse, and can be associated with an individual's [[psychological disorders]] or issues. Individuals who suffer from [[low self-esteem]], severely distorted [[body image]], untreated [[sexual dysfunction]], social isolation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or are in recovery from a prior [[sexual addiction]] are more vulnerable to cybersexual addictions.&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt;&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Alvin|author2=Coralie R. Scherer |author3=Sylvain C. Boies |author4=Barry L. Gordon |title=Sexuality on the Internet: From Sexual Exploration to Pathological Expression.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=April 1999|volume=30|issue=1|pages=154–164|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info/details-sfx.xqy?uri=/07357028/v30i0002/154_sotifsetpe.xml|accessdate=2 April 2013 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other psychological issues that may arise with this addiction include struggles for intimacy, self-worth, [[self-identity]], self-understanding.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

The impact of cybersex addiction may also impact the spouse, partner or others in relationships with the addict. The resulting effects on others may include depression, weight gain and lower self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Partners: Healing From His Addiction|last=Weiss|first=Douglas|publisher=Discovery Press|year=2011|isbn=1-881292-34-7|location=Colorado Springs, CO 80949|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If cyber sex addicts have children, their actions may also impact those children (whether they are grown adult children or younger dependents).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57754066|title=Beyond the bedroom : healing for adult children of sex addicts|last=Douglas.|first=Weiss,|date=2005|publisher=Health Communications|year=|isbn=0757303250|location=Deerfield Beach, FL|pages=17-21|oclc=57754066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM classification==
There is an ongoing debate in the medical community concerning the insufficient studies, and of those, their quality, or lack thereof, and the resulting analysis and conclusions drawn from them, such as they are. So far, without repeatable, meaningful, measurable, and quantifiable analysis, no medical community wide acceptably reasonable standards, a definition, have been drawn yet.

Hence, internet sex addiction, just like it's umbrella [[sexual addiction]], is still not listed in the [[DSM-5]],&lt;ref name=dsm-5&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last= American Psychiatric Association |year= 2013 |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= Fifth |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington, VA |pages= 797–798 |isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used by psychiatrists in the United States for diagnosing patients problems in a standard uniform way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''Legal consciousness''' is a ''collection'' of understood and/or imagined to have understood, [[legal awareness]] of ideas, views, feelings and traditions imbibed through [[legal socialization]]; which reflects as [[legal culture]] among given individual, or a group, or a given society at large. The legal consciousness evaluates the existing [[law]] and also bears in mind an image of the desired or ideal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Consciousness Among Youth at the Red Hook Community Justice Center By Aviad Lael Brisman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is not an individual trait nor solely ideational; legal consciousness is a type of [[Social Practice|social practice]] reflecting and forming [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Silbey Susan 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan|title=legal consciousness|journal=New Oxford Companion to Law|date=2008|pages=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/~ssilbey/www/pdf/Legal_consciousness.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015|ref=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of legal Consciousness documents the forms of participation and interpretation through which act or sustain, reproduce, or amend the circulating contested or hegemonic structures of meanings concerning [[law]]. Legal consciousness is the way in which [[law]] is experienced and interpreted by specific individuals as they engage, avoid, resist or just assume the [[law]] and legal meanings.

Legal consciousness is a state of being, [[legal socialisation]] is the process to Legal consciousness; where as [[legal awareness]] &amp; [[legal mobilisation]] are means to achieve  the same.

==Definition==
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1979) defined legal consciousness as " ''the sum of views and ideas expressing the attitude of people toward law, legality, and justice and their concept of what is lawful and unlawful. Legal consciousness is a form of social consciousness. Legal ideology, the system of legal views based on certain social and scientific viewpoints, is a concentrated expression of legal consciousness. The customs and feelings of people in relation to legal phenomena constitute the psychological aspect of legal consciousness; among these are a sense of justice and a loathing of crimes and illegal actions'' "

Legal consciousness is defined by Ewick and Silbey as the process by which people make sense of their experiences by relying on legal categories and concepts. People do this even when they are not familiar with the details and minutia of law or the legal system. They explain that there are cultural schemas provided by law that people use to make sense of their experiences. They refer to this as legality. The concept of legality includes "the meanings, sources, authority and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, regardless of who employs them or for what ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewick; Silbey|first1=Patricia; Susan|title=The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meanings and sources and different ways of knowing and understanding enable people to make sense of what happens to them and what that might mean in terms of their rights and options. This process of understanding legal experiences occurs within a larger ecosystem in which there are disputes over meaning and values. Seron and Munger explain that ""in addition, class may affect legal consciousness: Law may mean different things depending on an individual's location in the various hierarchies of status, prestige, and knowledge associated with membership in a social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seron; Munger|first1=Carroll; Frank|last2=Munger|first2=Frank|title=Law and Inequality: Race, Gender... and of Course, Class|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1996|volume=22|pages=187–212|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of injustice and inequality is a history of disuse of the law. Law has not failed--and is not failing.

'''Legal mobilisation''' is a tool available to paralegal and [[advocacy]] groups, to achieve [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]] by supporting a marginalized issues of a stakeholder, in negotiating with the other concerned agencies and other stakeholders, by strategic combined use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] along with [[advocacy]], media engagement and social mobilisation.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date= 1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Frances Kahen Zemans (1983) '' the Legal mobilisation is "a desire or want, which is translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights".'' &lt;ref name=Zemans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zemans|first1=Frances|title=Legal Mobilization: The Neglected Role of the Law in the Political System|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=Sep 1983|publisher=American Political Science Association|location=USA|volume= 77|issue=3|jstor=1957268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisa Vanhala (November 2011) Legal mobilisation in its  narrowest sense, may refer to high-profile litigation efforts for (or, arguably, against) [[social change]] or more '''broadly, term legal mobilisation has been used to describe any type of process by which an individual or collective actors invoke legal norms, discourse, or symbols to influence policy or behavior.'''&lt;ref name=Vanhala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanhala|first1=Lisa|title=Legal Mobilization|journal=Political Science|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 November 2014|ISBN= 9780199756223|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically means that there are policies or regulations to mobilize around and a mechanism by which to do so.&lt;ref name=Pettinicchio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinicchio|first1=David|title=The When, Why, and How of Legal Mobilization|website=Mobilizing Ideas|url=http://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/the-when-why-and-how-of-legal-mobilization/|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative activity does create an opportunity for legal mobilization.

'''Legal psychology''' involves [[empirical]], [[psychology|psychological]] research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as [[eyewitness memory]], jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the [[experimental research|experimental]] focus of legal psychology from the [[clinical psychology|clinically]]-oriented [[forensic psychology]].

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as "psychology and law". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis R. Fox]] (1999). [http://dennisfox.net/papers/injustice.html Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.]''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 23,'' 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 41, the [[American Psychology-Law Society]], is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of [[psychology]] to the understanding of [[law]] and [[legal system]]s through [[research]], as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing  education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to  inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large  of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ap-ls.org/
|title=American Psychology and the Law Society
|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.

==Areas of research==
Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving [[clinical psychology]], e.g., mental illness, [[competency evaluation (law)|competency]], [[insanity defense]], [[offender profiling]], etc., is typically categorized as [[forensic psychology]], and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to [[eyewitness testimony]] and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Saks]] (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. ''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 10'', 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several legal psychology [[academic journal|journal]]s, including ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]'', ''Psychology, Crime, and Law'', and ''Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' that focus on general topics of [[criminology]], and the [[criminal justice system]]. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.

In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct.  He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never  mattered "As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Legal psychologists typically hold a [[PhD]] in some area of psychology (e.g., [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory "works", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).

A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone [[PhD]] program or a joint [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found [http://ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php here] on the website of the [http://www.ap-ls.org/ American Psychology-Law Society].

==Roles of a legal psychologist==
===Academics and research===
Many legal psychologists work as [[professors]] in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in addition to a [[PhD]]

===Expert witnesses===
{{Main|Expert witness}}
Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, [[mistaken identity]], competence to stand trial, the propensity of a [[death-qualified jury]] to also be "pro-guilt", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being "hired guns" or "stating the obvious".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Eyewitness memory experts, such as [[Elizabeth Loftus]], are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and "unrealistic" scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

===Policy making and legislative guidance===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).&lt;ref&gt;Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the [[American Bar Foundation]] ([http://www.abf-sociolegal.org/ Website]) and [[Federal Judicial Center]] ([http://www.fjc.gov Website]), among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory roles===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229052858/http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Psychologists can provide an [[amicus brief]] to the court. The [[American Psychological Association]] has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0435_0223_ZC2.html Ballew v. Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; once called a reliance on statistics "numerology" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.

===Trial consulting===
Some legal psychologists work in [[trial consulting]]. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the [[American Society of Trial Consultants]], [http://www.astcweb.org/ ASTC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring "in-house" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.

Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing "mock trials" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, [[scientific jury selection|picking juries]], and even arranging "shadow jurors" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

The '''MIT Center for Information Systems Research''' (CISR) is a research center at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] founded in 1974. MIT CISR's research focuses on the use of information technology and management in complex organizations. Its mission is to "develop concepts and frameworks to help executives address the IT-related challenges of leading increasingly dynamic, global, and information-intensive organizations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cisr.mit.edu/about/our-mission/ Center for Information Systems Research: Our mission], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Information Systems Research has done groundbreaking research in the areas of managerial computing, [[Executive information system|executive support systems]], [[critical success factor]]s, [[Corporate governance of information technology|IT governance]], [[IT portfolio management]], [[operating model]], and [[enterprise architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Dana|title=Enterprise Architecture and Transformation at the Crossroads|url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/74616.html|work=E-Commerce News|publisher=ECT News Network, Inc.|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaino|first=Jennifer|title=MIT's Jeanne Ross On Bringing Psych Skills To Enterprise Architecture|url=http://smartenterpriseexchange.com/groups/smart-architect/blog/2012/02/08/enterprise-architects-maybe-it-s-time-to-revisit-psych-101|work=Smart Enterprise Exchange|publisher=UBM TechWeb|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Center for Information Systems Research (CISR) was established in 1974 by the MIT Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. Its initial mission was described as: ''To conduct research on the effective use of computer-based [[information systems]], and in particular concern itself with helping [[Management|manager]]s deal with questions of information system effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="CISR 1974"&gt;Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, Center for Information Systems Research (1974) ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17993694M/Statement_of_purpose_structure_and_research_goals. Statement of Purpose, Structure and Research Goals]''. REPORT CISR-1. SLOAN WP 749-74, November 1, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Among its first scientists were [[John F. Rockart]], [[Norman Rasmussen]], [[Peter Chen]], [[John J. Donovan]], [[Stuart Madnick]], Henry D. Jacoby, Peter G.W. Keen, Charles B. Stabell, Steve Alter and Michael J. Ginzberg.&lt;ref name="CISR 1974"/&gt;

Over the years the Center for Information Systems Research has published a series of about 400 working papers, and has held many seminars and conferences. Together with other early IT research centers, such as the Management Information Systems Research Center at Minnesota (established in 1968), they helped to shape the young information systems discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Blake, Margrethe H. Olson, and Ron Weber. "Guest editorial: a valued institution builder: Gordon B. Davis." ''MIS Quarterly'' 29.3 (2005): v-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first long standing director of the Center for Information Systems Research was [[John F. Rockart]], who managed the Center from 1976 to 2000; Professor [[Michael Scott Morton]] was the first director, from 1974 to 1976. He was succeeded by [[Peter Weill]], who was succeeded in 2008 by the current director [[Jeanne W. Ross]]. Peter Weill is currently the chairman of MIT CISR.

Other researchers and (former) faculty members associated with the Center for Information Systems Research are [[John F. Rockart]], [[Dale L. Goodhue]], [[Stuart Madnick]], [[JoAnne Yates]], [[Wanda Orlikowski]], [[Peter Weill]], [[Jeanne W. Ross]], [[Cynthia Beath]] and [[Shoshana Zuboff]].

The '''Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Prize''' for the Arts is awarded by The [[Canada Council]] for the Arts. Two prizes are awarded annually to distinguished individuals. One prize is awarded in the arts, one in the social sciences and humanities. The prizes are $50,000 each, and intended to encourage continuing contribution to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Canada.

==Endowment==
Funded by an endowment from the Molson Foundation, the prizes are administered by the Canada Council for the Arts in cooperation with the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]. Laureates are chosen by a peer assessment committee appointed jointly by the Canada Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

==Eligibility==
Candidates must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. To be nominated, candidates must have made a substantial and distinguished contribution over a significant period of time. In the words of the deed of gift, the prizes are intended "to encourage Canadians of outstanding achievement in the fields of the [[Arts]], the [[Humanities]] or the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] to make further contribution to the cultural or intellectual heritage of Canada". The terms of reference are interpreted as follows:
*outstanding achievement must have already been amply demonstrated
*further contribution implies that the laureates should still be very active and productive. 

In other words, the prize is not intended as an "end of service" reward or as recognition for one great accomplishment. Past assessment committees have been quite consistent in choosing laureates who are close to the top of an outstanding career. Corporations and other organizations are excluded from consideration, as are posthumous awards. No individual may be awarded the prize more than once. The prizes are accessible to qualified persons from Aboriginal Peoples and diverse cultural and regional communities. Members of the board of the Canada Council for the Arts and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council are not eligible to be considered for this prize during the course of their terms as members nor for six months following the end of their term.

==Nomination process==
Candidates may not apply for the Canada Council for the Arts Molson Prizes on their own behalf. They must be nominated by three individuals or three organizations, or a combination of individuals and organizations. Nominations are sought from persons and organizations that have the interest and capacity to nominate appropriate individuals. Nominators may submit one letter signed by the three nominating individuals or organizations, or submit three separate letters of nomination. Nominators are responsible for gathering and providing relevant documentation to the Canada Council.

==Selection procedure==
The two laureates are chosen by a single, multidisciplinary peer assessment committee co-chaired by the Chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts and the President of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Members are chosen to ensure fair representation of gender, the two official languages, the various regions and cultures of Canada, and the various types of artistic and scholarly disciplines. Committee members are among the most accomplished individuals in their respective fields and, ideally, have interests that extend beyond the confines of a single discipline.

The '''My Science Career''' website is an Irish online resource for career information in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM).

The website has a famous Irish scientists section, science related articles, a science career glossary and a video interviews section with scientists about their work. “A day in the life” section looks at the everyday working loves of Irish scientists and science broadcasters, ranging from a professor of biochemistry to a marine photographer.

A “Science Ambassadors” section profiles Irish scientists on what it’s like working in various fields and the qualifications they have. The Science Ambassadors range from newly qualified graduates to well established researchers.

MyScienceCareer.ie is an initiative of Ireland’s national integrated awareness programme [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover-science.ie/programmes-and-audiences/mysciencecareer About My Science Career on DSE programme website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729130931/http://www.discover-science.ie/programmes-and-audiences/mysciencecareer |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (DSE), a government initiative. DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science.ie]], [[Science Week Ireland]] and [[Discover Primary Science]].

'''Nanoengineering''' is the practice of [[engineering]] on the [[nanoscale]]. It derives its name from the [[nanometre]], a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter.

Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for [[nanotechnology]], but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field.

==Degree programs==

{{Seealso|Nanotechnology education}}

The first nanoengineering program  was started at the [[University of Toronto]] within the Engineering Science program as one of the options of study in the final years. In 2003, the [[Lund Institute of Technology]] started a program in Nanoengineering. In 2004, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]] at [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] was established on the campus of the [[University at Albany]]. In 2005, the [[University of Waterloo]] established a unique program which offers a full degree in Nanotechnology Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.nanotech.uwaterloo.ca/About_Nano_at_UW/
| title = Welcome to Nanotechnology Engineering at UW
| publisher = Department of Nanotechnology Engineering
| accessdate = 2008-10-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana Tech University]] started the first program in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006 the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] started a Bachelor and a Master program NanoEngineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.uni-due.de/nanoengineering/| title = NanoEngineering at University of Duisburg-Essen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike early NanoEngineering programs, the first Nanoengineering Department in the world, offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees, was established by the  [[University of California, San Diego]] in 2007.
In 2009, the [[University of Toronto]] began offering all Options of study in Engineering Science as degrees, bringing the second nanoengineering degree to Canada. Rice University  established in 2016 a Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering (MSNE).
DTU Nanotech - the Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology - is a department at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] established in 1990.

In 2013, [[Wayne State University]] began offering a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Certificate Program, which is funded by a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Education (NUE) grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The primary goal is to offer specialized undergraduate training in nanotechnology. Other goals are: 1) to teach emerging technologies at the undergraduate level, 2) to train a new adaptive workforce, and 3) to retrain working engineers and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.wayne.edu/nano/about.php/|title=Wayne State University Nanoengineering Certificate Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

* [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) - Can be used to both image, and to manipulate structures as small as a single atom.
* [[Molecular self-assembly]] - Arbitrary sequences of [[DNA]] can now be synthesized cheaply in bulk, and used to create custom proteins or regular patterns of amino acids. Similarly, DNA strands can bind to other DNA strands, allowing simple structures to be created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">"'''Nature Farming'''" was established in 1936 by [[Mokichi Okada]], the founder of the [[Church of World Messianity]], an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or {{nihongo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Agriculture: Definition and Terms. Special Reference Briefs Series no. SRB 99-02, September 1999. Compiled by: Mary V. Gold, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting ‘Kyusei nature farming’, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Setboonsarng, S. and Gilman, J. 1999. Alternative Agriculture in Thailand and Japan. HORIZON Communications, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZZ2, a farming conglomerate in South Africa has translated the term to [[Afrikaans]], "Natuurboerdery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Silent|first=Taurayi,|title=An investigation of natuurboerdery (natural farming) approach : a ZZ2 case study|date=March 2011|publisher=Stellenbosch : University of Stellenbosch|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/6694|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Proof of Mokichi Okada's Nature Farming Theories by Xu, Hui-lian. Agricultural Experiment Station, International Nature Farming Research Center, Nagano&lt;/ref&gt; it is based on the theories that:
* [[Fertilizer]]s pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutritional conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by [[Industrial agriculture|chemical farming]].
The term is sometimes used for an alternative farming philosophy of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].

==Natural Farming==
{{Main|Natural Farming}}
Another Japanese farmer and philosopher, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], conceived of an alternative farming system in the 1930s separately from Okada and used the same Japanese characters to describe it.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|accessdate=6 March 2011|type=Monograph|year=2001|publisher=Research Signpost|location=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9670">'''Nutrition psychology (NP)''' is the psychological study of how cognitive choices, such as meal decisions, influence nutrition, psychological health, and overall health{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.  Nutrition psychology seeks to understand the relationship between nutritional behavior and mental health/well-being.  NP is a sub-field of [[psychology]] and more specifically of [[health psychology]]. It may be applied to numerous different fields including: [[psychology]], [[dietetics]], [[nutrition]], and [[marketing]]. NP is a fairly new field with a brief history that has already started to contribute information and knowledge to psychology.  There are two main areas of controversy within nutrition psychology. The first area of controversy is that the topic can be viewed in two different ways.  It can be viewed as nutrition affecting psychological functions, or psychological choices and behavior influencing nutrition and health. The second controversy being the defining of what is "healthy" or "normal" as related to nutrition.

==Overview==
{{Synthesis|section|date=April 2018}}
Nutrition is defined as, "the act or process of nourishing or being nourished; ''specifically'':  the sum of the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nutrition|title = Definition of NUTRITION|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Psychology is defined as, "the study of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychology|title = Definition of PSYCHOLOGY|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, the particular field is nutrition. Therefore, nutrition psychology is the study of mind and behavior in relation to the process of taking in and utilizing food.

=== Objectives ===
Today, over one third of American adults are considered "[[Obesity|obese]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html|title = Adult Obesity Facts Data Adult Obesity DNPAO CDC|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition psychology aims to explain what psychological reasons may be behind this and other health trends. Nutrition psychology looks at the internal psychological effects of why people do what they do, and how they are shaped and influenced by outside stimuli.

== Origins and development ==
Nutrition psychology is a field that is still in its early stages of development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} With [[obesity]] being a continually growing problem in the [[United States]] and abroad, nutrition psychology is gaining importance and popularity in society today. As it has grown, nutrition psychology has directly and indirectly influenced research on [[dieting]], [[Nutrition facts label|food labels]], the way food is marketed, [[food technology]], obesity, and the attitude of the public towards food, among other topics.

Some research discusses the idea of "Food faddism," which is loosely defined as, "the idea that too much weight is put upon the influence of food and diet on overall health and that claims, whether good or bad, are often exaggerated."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=William T.|date=1983-01-01|title=Food Faddism, Cultism, and Quackery|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|volume=3|issue=1|pages=35–52|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|pmid=6315036}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea of food choices having extreme consequences is thought to be deeply ingrained into culture, possibly stemming from the story of [[Adam and Eve]] eating the [[forbidden fruit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Food labels ===
In 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) required that [[Nutrition facts label|nutrition labels]] be put on food products in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesel|first=Kristin|last2=McCluskey|first2=Jill J.|last3=Villas-Boas|first3=Sofia B.|date=2011-01-01|title=Nutritional Labeling and Consumer Choices|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=3|issue=1|pages=141–158|doi=10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought behind doing so was to provide consumers with the necessary information to make educated decisions about the foods that they purchased. Since that time, nutrition psychologists have done research on how influential these labels are on how consumers choose what foods to buy. These studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of nutritional labeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the research, the average consumer does tend to read the labels and take the information into consideration, in part because companies have begun producing foods with more health-conscious ingredients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many of these potential health benefits are overshadowed by the continuing increase in obesity and deaths related to obesity in the United States over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marketing ===
As with any industry, [[marketing]] plays an important role in the buying and selling of food products. Marketing campaigns for food and beverages are increasingly prevalent today and are larger in scope than ever before, given the resources that large corporations are able to use in the forms of social media and [[viral marketing]]. Some researchers claim that the dramatic rise in obesity rates are at least in part, due to an increase in the marketing of food over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Frederick J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=32|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|pmid=21219166}}&lt;/ref&gt; New marketing strategies have taken many forms, including changing the packaging of the food or beverage itself, product placement in media, advertisements in schools, increased focus on "value meals" with larger portions, and endorsements by athletes or celebrities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these methods increase exposure to younger consumers, who studies show, tend to be more impressionable than adults and whose eating patterns as children can continue long into their adult lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are calls for junk food television advertisements to be banned before 9.00 pm to prevent children seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/top-paediatrician-says-its-time-to-give-parents-extra-votes-for-their-children Top paediatrician says it's time to give parents extra votes for their children] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food technology ===
Recently, food has been a source of technological development. Nutrition psychologists have studied the public's perception of food technology such as genetic modification or additives that may extend the shelf life of food, among other topics. In general, the findings show that the average consumer is more likely to avoid food that is affected by technology and will prefer organic, all-natural choices.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lusk|first=Jayson L.|last2=Roosen|first2=Jutta|last3=Bieberstein|first3=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=Consumer Acceptance of New Food Technologies: Causes and Roots of Controversies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=381–405|doi=10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological effects are often perceived by consumers to pose health risks, even if those claims are not founded in facts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Fad diets ===
Nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a day-to-day basis, but also the ways in which and why they [[Dieting|diet]] and [[Physical exercise|exercise]]. [[Fad diet]]s are popular in today's society and they usually play heavily on potential customers' ideals about what they should weigh or look like. These diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a person's food intake that supposedly will result in [[Weight Loss/Dieting|weight loss]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/home|title=Food Facts home|website=www.bda.uk.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; People become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen. However, these claims are not always founded in scientific research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 2004 documentary film, ''[[Super Size Me]]'', directed by and starring [[Morgan Spurlock]] focuses on the ways in which the [[fast food]] industry in America is influencing how people and especially young children, view nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spurlock|first = Morgan|title = Super Size Me|date = 2004-06-11|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/?ref_=nv_sr_1|accessdate = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presbyterian College''', commonly known as '''PC''', is a four-year, [[Private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Clinton, South Carolina]] and affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church USA]]. Presbyterian's undergraduate and graduate programs emphasize small class sizes, a congenial atmosphere between professors and students, and a commitment to service.

==History ==
[[Image:wpjacobs.jpg|thumb|right|130px|William Plumer Jacobs]]
Presbyterian College was founded in 1880 by the Rev. William Plumer Jacobs. He had served as the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Clinton since 1864, and founded the Thornwell Orphanage.  Originally called Clinton College, its first class (including three women) graduated in 1883.  In establishing PC, his "tree of knowledge", Jacobs' goal was to educate young people for lives of service to church and society, and thereby be, in his words, "epistles to Christ's honor and glory".&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Griffith, ''Presbyterian College ''(Arcadia: Charleston, Portsmouth, Chicago, San Francisco, 2001), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Jacobs' death in 1917, the college had grown considerably in size and resources, and had six major buildings. Neville Hall, PC's most recognized structure, was constructed in 1907. The tenure of president Davison McDowell Douglas (1911-1926) saw the tripling of the size of the faculty and student body, the construction of four new buildings, and growth in the College's assets from $150,000 to over $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Griffith, ''Presbyterian College ''(Arcadia: Charleston, Portsmouth, Chicago, San Francisco, 2001), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  After weathering the storms of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Second World War]], Presbyterian has continued expansion on many fronts through the second half of the twentieth century. It became fully co-educational in 1965 (and in so doing dropped its previous motto, "Where Men are Made"). In 1969, it began admitting African-American students.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (2001), ''Presbyterian College,'' pp. 16, 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
===Undergraduate===
Presbyterian College is a Carnegie One Liberal Arts College and is fully accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/about/|title=About Presbyterian College|work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of the Liberal Arts confers B.A. and B.S. degrees in 30 courses of study and 9 pre-professional programs including Pre-Law, Pre-Med, Pre-Theology, and Pre-Pharmacy.  PC also offers a dual-degree program in Engineering (with Clemson University, Auburn University, Georgia Tech, the University of South Carolina, and Vanderbilt University) and minor fields in an additional 13 disciplines such as Africana Studies, Media Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2013/03/catalog-2012-2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=catalog 2012-2013|pages=34, 43, 49|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927201018/http://www.presby.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2013/03/catalog-2012-2013.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presby.edu/academics/majors/|title=Academics at Presbyterian College|work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal arts program has small average class sizes (13-15 students), and has six Carnegie/CASE South Carolina Professor of the Year Award winners.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;[[Image:Nevillestudents.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Students at Neville Hall]]

PC is one of two South Carolina colleges or universities with a Confucius Institute, which fosters economic connections and cultural interaction between the US and China. Through the Institute, Presbyterian participates in a partnership and exchange program with [[Guizhou University]], located in [[Guiyang]], [[China]]. The Confucius Institute sponsors cultural events on PC's campus and offers elementary, intermediate, and advanced courses in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/ci/|title=Confucius Institute|work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confuciusinstitute.unl.edu/institutes.shtml|title=Confucius Institutes Around the Globe|author=University of Nebraska-Lincoln - Web Developer Network|work=unl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/ci/curriculum/|title=Confucius Institute of Presbyterian College|work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Religion of SEC Football====
Presbyterian offers a one-credit elective Freshman course entitled ''The Religion of [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] [[College football|Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://gridironnow.com/presbyterian-college-offering-religion-of-sec-football-course/ Presbyterian College now offering "Religion of SEC Football" course&lt;/ref&gt; The class is co-taught by PC professors Dr. Michael Nelson and Dr. Terry Barr, who are [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] fans, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyff4.com/news/Upstate-college-offers-Religion-of-SEC-Football-course/41332452 Upstate college offers "Religion of SEC Football" course&lt;/ref&gt; The class has been taught for more than a decade, but gained a lot of media attention in the fall of 2016 after the class appeared as a headline on [[Reddit]]. Nelson has spoken on several radio shows on the topic, including one from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville, AR]] and one from [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia, SC]]. Barr appeared on the [[Paul Finebaum]] Show&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=17370276 Presbyterian College Professor Dr. Terry Barr joins the Paul Finebaum show.&lt;/ref&gt; via phone in late August to discuss the details of the course.

The course focuses on the parallels between college football and [[religion]], and how many people strongly prioritize one over the other.

===Graduate===
The School of Pharmacy confers Doctorate of Pharmacy degrees (PharmD) and is oriented toward serving the healthcare needs of underdeveloped and economically depressed areas of South Carolina and the greater US.  A 54,000 square-foot facility, its doors opened in the fall of 2010 with an inaugural class of 80 students. The School of Pharmacy was fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.presby.edu/blog/2014/07/03/breaking-news-pcsp-receives-accreditation/|title=Breaking News: Presbyterian College School of Pharmacy's Doctor of Pharmacy Program is Accredited|work=presby.edu|access-date=2014-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112035900/http://pharmacy.presby.edu/blog/2014/07/03/breaking-news-pcsp-receives-accreditation/|archive-date=2014-11-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its youth, it has accrued multiple awards including a Biomedical/Biobehavioral Research Administration Development (BRAD) grant from the National Institute of Health, and a Generation Rx Champion Award from the South Carolina Pharmacy Association (SCPhA) for its efforts at raising awareness of prescription drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.presby.edu/pcsp-apha-as-wins-generation-rx-champion-award/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130816031656/http://pharmacy.presby.edu/pcsp-apha-as-wins-generation-rx-champion-award/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-08-16|title=PCSP APhA-ASP wins Generation Rx Champion Award|work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.presby.edu/school-receives-first-nih-grant/|title=School Receives First NIH Grant|work=presby.edu|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927201021/http://pharmacy.presby.edu/school-receives-first-nih-grant/|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student body and campus life==

===Size and makeup===
The 2014 edition of ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' regards Presbyterian College as a "selective" institution that accepted 57.8% of applicants in the fall of 2012. Of PC's 1,172 undergraduates, 44% are male and 56% are female, and 97% live on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/presbyterian-college-3445|work=US News and World Report: Education, Colleges, National Liberal Arts Colleges|accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
Students at PC have many options for extracurricular activities.  In addition to intramural athletics, Greek life is an important part of campus life and culture, as around 45% of the student body is affiliated with one of nine fraternities and sororities.  For men, there are seven North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) organizations (chapter designation in Greek): [[Alpha Sigma Phi]] (ΑΨ), [[Kappa Alpha Order]] (ΒΠ), [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] (Μ), [[Pi Kappa Phi]] (Β), [[Sigma Nu]] (ΖΘ), [[Omega Psi Phi]] (ΑΔΩ), and [[Theta Chi]] (ΒΨ).  For women, there are three [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) organizations: [[Alpha Delta Pi]] (ΗΞ), [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]] (ΕΠ), and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]] (ΚΒ).   Aside from Greek life, PC offers its students many other social clubs and advocacy organizations like Secular Student Alliance, College Republicans, College Democrats, and Multicultural Student Union.&lt;ref name="involvement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/home/involvement/|title=Campus Life at Presbyterian College|work=presby.edu|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913194520/http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/home/involvement/|archive-date=2013-09-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also many religious ministries, including the Presbyterian Student Association, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Campus Outreach.  Finally, Presbyterian actively promotes service organizations and opportunities. Many PC students participate in initiatives like [[Special Olympics]], [[Relay for Life]], tutoring local high school and middle school students, and CHAMPS, a mentoring service for local youth.&lt;ref name="involvement"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc-champs.org/|title=CHAMPS - Communities Helping, Assisting, Mentoring Promising Students|work=pc-champs.org|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905221832/http://www.pc-champs.org/|archive-date=2013-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor Code===
Since 1915 all aspects of life at Presbyterian have been regulated by a student-run honor code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2013/03/bluebook.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blue Book|pages=2 of 16|publisher=presby.edu|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927201014/http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2013/03/bluebook.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signing of the honor code is a central fixture of each academic year's opening convocation ceremony and is a requirement for all incoming students, faculty, and coaches. The honor code binds one to "abstain from all deceit," to "neither give nor receive unacknowledged aid in [one's] academic work," to "respect the persons and property of the community" and to "not condone discourteous or dishonest treatment of these by [one's] peers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/honor/|title=Campus Life at Presbyterian College|work=presby.edu|access-date=2013-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028034135/http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/honor/|archive-date=2013-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspected violations of the honor code go before the College's honor council, composed of students and faculty, which has the power to sanction, suspend, or dismiss those found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2013/03/bluebook.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blue Book|pages=4, 5, 12|publisher=presby.edu|access-date=2013-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927201014/http://www.presby.edu/campus-life/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2013/03/bluebook.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus===
[[Image:nevillehall.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Neville Hall]]

PC's {{convert|240|acres|adj=on}} campus covers areas in and around Clinton, SC, providing academic buildings, dining facilities, recreational areas, and athletics venues. The college's 15 townhouses, 11 residence halls, and 9 apartments house nearly all of the undergraduate student body. Six buildings on Presbyterian College's campus (Doyle Hall, Laurens Hall, Jacobs Hall, the President's House, Neville Hall, and the campus bell tower) are part of the [[Thornwell-Presbyterian College Historic District]], a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. However, Doyle Hall was demolished in July 2014 as part of the renovations for Georgia Hall.

==Athletics==

{{main|Presbyterian Blue Hose}}
Athletics is very important to PC's life and culture. Around 1/3 of the student body competes as student-athletes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presby.edu/about/pc/|title=About Presbyterian College |work=presby.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many PC alumni are or were professional coaches at the college level, current women's soccer coach Brian Purcell ('87), former head football coach [[Harold Nichols (American football)|Harold Nichols]] ('89), former Vanderbilt basketball head coach Roy Skinner ('52), and Bob Waters ('60), a record-setting head football coach at Western Carolina.

Presbyterian is a member of the [[Big South Conference]] of NCAA Division I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsouthsports.com/teams/presbyterian|title=Presbyterian|work=bigsouthsports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fields seventeen varsity teams in eleven sports: football (FCS), men's and women's cross country, volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, softball, men's and women's golf, men's and women's tennis, women's lacrosse, baseball, and men's and women's wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobluehose.com/|title=Presbyterian College Blue Hose - The Official Athletics Site|work=gobluehose.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College's colors are royal blue and garnet and its teams are known as the Blue Hose. Although PC's mascot Scottie the Scotsman is a medieval Scottish warrior, the Blue Hose name originally referred to the socks worn by the football team in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/10497/whats-the-deal-with-prebyterian-college|title=What's the deal with ...

===The Bronze Derby===
{{Main|Bronze Derby}}
[[Image:bderby.jpg|thumb|left|The Bronze Derby]]

Until 2007, PC's fierce rivalry with [[Newberry College]] was expressed in the annual [[Bronze Derby]] football game, named for the series's trophy, which made its debut in 1947 after a basketball game between the two colleges. After the game, which PC won 51–47, a scuffle broke out between supporters of both colleges and a derby hat was snatched from the head of a PC student. The hat was eventually returned, cast in bronze, and transformed into a symbol of the rivalry. The last installment of the Bronze Derby game was played in November 2006 at [[Bailey Memorial Stadium]] in Clinton, where PC defeated Newberry 10-0. The Blue Hose lead the all-time Bronze Derby series, but since Presbyterian's transition to Division I in 2007 the annual clash has been postponed indefinitely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

&lt;/ref&gt;

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]] awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates were Christians]], over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;Baruch A.

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.&lt;ref name=Census.ie&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile 7 – Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile%207%20Education%20Ethnicity%20and%20Irish%20Traveller%20entire%20doc.pdf|publisher=Census Statistics Office|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

However, both groups were still a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=How Religious are America’s College and University Professors?|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf|publisher=SSRC|author2=Solon Simmons |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Phil | last1=Zuckerman | year=2009 | title=Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | journal=Sociology Compass | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=949–971 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228104545/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | archivedate=2014-12-28 | df= }}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Daniel|title=Less-educated Americans turning their backs on religion|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-08/asa-lea081511.php|work=American Sociological Association|publisher=Eureka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=267–268|quote= The effects of income become insignificant, however, the impact of education actually reverses in the United States: ''it is the more educated who attend church most frequently.'' It therefore appears that the typical socioeconomic profile of churchgoing is indeed somewhat distinctive in the United States when compared with other wealthy countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University? Conversion Experience, Creativity and Intelligence|url=http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_6/3-jirrs6-dutton.pdf|publisher=Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

'''Roderick Frazier Nash''' is a professor emeritus of history and environmental studies at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]].  He was the first person to descend the [[Tuolumne River]] (using a raft).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Scholarly biography ==
Nash received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1960 and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://aapra.org/pugsley-bios/roderick-frazier-nash&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of several books and many essays. His [[dissertation]], "Wilderness and the American Mind," done under the supervision of [[Merle Curti]], became what has come to be seen as one of the foundational texts of the field of [[environmental history]]. After teaching for two years at [[Dartmouth College]], he was called to the growing History Department at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] where he joined distinguished historians such as [[Wilbur Jacobs]], [[Robert O. Collins]], [[Frank J. Frost]], [[C. Warren Hollister]], [[Leonard Marsak]], and [[Joachim Remak]]. After witnessing a massive oil spill in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1969 he and a number of other faculty members became active within the University and founded an environmental studies program there in 1970.  Since the initial 12 graduates in 1972, there have been 4,000 graduates within 300 separate majors.  Nash is a firm believer in environmental education and is also an avid [[white water rafting|white-water river rafter]].

== ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' ==

Nash's study in this book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PJZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=20oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4335,743719&amp;dq=roderick-nash+raft&amp;hl=en|title=Parks Subject of New Special|date=March 7, 1981|work=[[Waycross Journal-Herald]]|page=P5|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the attitude of Americans' toward the idea of wilderness. He discusses the different attitudes that American's have had toward nature since colonization and the changing uses and definitions of 'wilderness'in that context. Specifically, Nash describes the evolution of American wilderness conception through Transcendentalism, Primitivism, Preservationism, to Conservationism.&lt;ref name="Wilderness and the American Mind, Nash 1973" /&gt; Nash states that if wilderness is to survive, we must, paradoxically, manage wilderness – at the very least, our behavior towards the wilderness must be managed.

== Personal Philosophy ==

Nash presents America's anthropocentric view as the main enemy to all wilderness preservation.  He argues that an ecocentric view is ideal and may work in the long run, but perhaps the preservation of nature and wilderness for the sake of holding resources out for the preservation of our own species would be more salient. Yet, even this strategy is hard for people to grasp, because it requires us to reach outside the present and look to the future. Still, Nash suggests that maybe the simple preservation of the environment for the sake of our own generation's recreation and health (oxygen sinks, etc.) could provide the impetus to slow some profiteering.

Nash also talks of how wilderness teaches us the value of humility. The problem is that humanity does not want to be humbled.  Humans are a proud species who will do anything to avoid being humbled.  To this end, we have ripped the wildness from the wilderness and removed all that causes any threat to our existence.

Nash believes that humankind has two choices in the next 1,000 years. We can "trash the planet into a wasteland" or adopt a plan to distill the world's population in 500 "islands" while allowing wilderness to flourish around us.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11671">'''Screen reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] a [[Written language|text]] on a [[computer screen]], [[smartphone]], [[e-book reader]], etc. It is often contrasted with the act of reading a text on [[paper]], in particular a [[Printing|print]]ed text.

== Discovery ==
[[Louis Émile Javal]], a French ophthalmologist and founder of an ophthalmology laboratory in Paris is credited with the introduction of the term [[saccades]] into eye movement research. Javal discovered that while reading, one’s eyes tend to jump across the text in saccades, and stop intermittently along each line in [[fixation (visual)|fixations]].&lt;ref name="Javal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wade | first1 = Nicholas J | year = 2010 | title = Pioneers of Eye Movement Research | journal = i-Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 33–68 | pmc=3563053 | pmid=23396982 | doi=10.1068/i0389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of technology at the time, naked-eye observations were used to observe [[eye movement in reading|eye movement]], until later in the late 19th and mid-20th century [[eye tracking|eye-tracking]] experiments were conducted in an attempt to discover a pattern regarding eye fixations while reading.&lt;ref name="Javal"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== F-Pattern ===
In a 1997 study conducted by Jakob Nielsen, a leading web usability expert who co-founded usability consulting company [[Nielsen Norman Group]] with [[Donald Norman]], it was discovered that generally people read 25% slower on a computer screen in comparison with a printed page.&lt;ref name=Beam&gt;{{cite news |title=I screen, you screen, we all screen |author=[[Alex Beam]] |date=2009-06-19 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/06/19/paper_vs_computer_screen/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers state that this is only true for when reading on an older type computer screen with a low-scanrate.

In an additional study done in 2006, Nielsen also discovered that people read Web pages in an '''F-shaped pattern''' that consists of two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"&gt;{{cite web |title=F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content |author=[[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] |date=2006-04-17 |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 232 participants fitted with eye-tracking cameras to trace their eye movements as they read online texts and webpages. The findings showed that people do not read the text on webpages word-by-word, but instead generally read horizontally across the top of the webpage, then in a second horizontal movement slightly lower on the page, and lastly  scan vertically down the left side of the screen.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"/&gt;

The Software Usability Research Laboratory at Wichita State University did a subsequent study in 2007 testing eye gaze patterns while searching versus browsing a website [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/], and the results confirmed that users appeared to follow Nielsen’s ‘F’ pattern while browsing and searching through text-based pages.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Sav, and Kelsi Lenz. [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/ "Eye Gaze Patterns while Searching vs. Browsing a Website"], ''SURL'', Jan. 14, 2007, retrieved Feb. 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of German researchers conducted a study that examined the Web browsing behavior of 25 participants over the course of around one hundred days.The researchers concluded that "browsing is a rapidly interactive activity,"[https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf] and that Web pages are mostly viewed for 10 seconds or less.&lt;ref&gt;H. Weinreich et al. [https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf "Not Quite the Average: An Empirical Study of Web Use"], ''ACM Transactions on the Web'', Vol. 2, No. 1, Article 5, Feb. 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen analyzed this data in 2008 and found that, on average, users read 20-28% of the content on a webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/ "How Little Do Users Read?"], ''Nielsen Norman Group'', May 6, 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Google Golden Triangle ===
A similar study, using search results from the [[Google search engine]], determined that readers primarily looked at a triangular area of the top and left side of the screen.  This corresponds to the Nielsen F-shaped pattern, and was dubbed the '''[[Golden Triangle (Internet Marketing)|Google Golden Triangle]]'''.&lt;ref name="EyetoolsGGTArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113060242/http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |title=Google Search's Golden Triangle |publisher=Eyetools |archivedate=13 January 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent 2014 Meditative study &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediative.com/eye-tracking-google-through-the-years/ "Keeping an eye on Google – Eye tracking SERPs through the years"]&lt;/ref&gt; showed evidence of the declination of the Golden Triangle phenomenon since 2005 as users view more search result listings than before.

== Comparisons to Reading Printed Text ==
Since the first notion of screen reading, many studies have been performed to discern any differences between reading off of an electronic device and reading off of a paper.  In a 2013 study, a group of 72 high school students in Norway were randomly assigned into one of two groups: one that read using [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files on a computer and one that used standard paper.  The students were put through various tests involving reading-comprehension and vocabulary. The results indicated that those who read using the PDF files performed much worse than those reading off of a paper. A conclusion was reached that certain aspects of screen reading, such as scrolling, can impede comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangen|first=Anne|last2=Walgermo|first2=Bente R.|last3=Brønnick|first3=Kolbjørn|date=2013-01-01|title=Reading linear texts on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035512001127|journal=International Journal of Educational Research|volume=58|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.ijer.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all experiments have concluded that reading from a digitized screen can be detrimental.  The same year, another experiment was conducted on 90 undergraduates at a college in Western New York involving paper reading, computer reading, and e-book reading. Like the children in the Norwegian experiment, the students were tested for comprehension upon reading a number of passages: five focused around facts and information and the other five based on narratives.  No significant difference was found between any of the different forms of reading for either type of passage.  However, the researchers noted that due to the participants being college students who were accustomed to using technology, they may react differently to reading on electronic devices than older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margolin|first=Sara J.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Casey|last3=Toland|first3=Michael J.|last4=Kegler|first4=Jennifer Little|date=2013-07-01|title=E-readers, Computer Screens, or Paper: Does Reading Comprehension Change Across Media Platforms?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.2930/abstract|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=512–519|doi=10.1002/acp.2930|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2014 by Tirza Lauterman and Rakefet Ackerman allowed subjects the option to choose between reading digitally or reading printed pages.  The results found that those who chose to read digitally performed worse than those who used print.  However, by practicing with PDF files, subjects that preferred to read on computers were able to overcome what researchers labeled as “screen inferiority” and managed to score just as well as paper readers, who did not improve with practice.  Lauterman and Ackerman concluded that the study supported the idea that screen reading is shallower than paper reading, but that with practice the shallowness can be removed as an impediment.  No conclusion has yet been reached among professionals regarding whether or not reading on a screen is significantly different than reading printed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauterman|first=Tirza|last2=Ackerman|first2=Rakefet|date=2014-06-01|title=Overcoming screen inferiority in learning and calibration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214001149|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=455–463|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics have voiced concerns about screen reading, though some have taken a more positive stance. [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] believes that we are transitioning from "book fluency to screen fluency, from literacy to visuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Becoming Screen Literate |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-11-21 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Rosen. "[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/people-of-the-screen People of the Screen]", ''The New Atlantis'', Number 22, Fall 2008, pp. 20–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Mangen holds that because of the materialist nature of a printed book the reader is more engaged with a text, while the opposite is true with a digital text in which the reader is engaged in a "shallower, less focused way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypertext fiction reading: haptics and immersion |author=Anne Mangen |year=2008 |journal=Journal of Research in Reading |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=404–419 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9817.2008.00380.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Online Literacy Is a Lesser Kind: Slow reading counterbalances Web skimming |author=Mark Bauerlein |date=2008-09-19 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |volume=54 |issue=31 |pages=Page B7 |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i04/04b01001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]], author of ''[[The Shallows (book)|The Shallows]]'', says that “the ability to skim text is every bit as important as the ability to read deeply. What is… troubling, is that skimming is becoming our dominant mode of reading” (138).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Nicholas |date=2010 |title=The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |page=138 |isbn=978-0393339758}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to computer screens can have negative effects on the eyes, causing symptoms of [[computer vision syndrome]] (CVS) that include strained eyes and blurred vision.  The occurrence of CVS has grown greatly over the past few years, effecting a large majority of American workers who spend over three hours a day on computers in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blehm|first=Clayton|last2=Vishnu|first2=Seema|last3=Khattak|first3=Ashbala|last4=Mitra|first4=Shrabanee|last5=Yee|first5=Richard W.|date=2005-05-01|title=Computer Vision Syndrome: A Review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039625705000093|journal=Survey of Ophthalmology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.02.008|pmid=15850814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semantic analysis (computational)''' is a composite of the "[[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]]" and the "computational" components.

"Semantic analysis" refers to a formal analysis of meaning, and "computational" refer to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, P., and Bos, J. (2005), [https://philpapers.org/rec/BLARAI Representation and Inference for Natural Language : A First Course in Computational Semantics], CSLI Publications. {{ISBN|1-57586-496-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

[[Image:Michelangelo Caravaggio 026.jpg|thumb|[[Caravaggio]]'s ''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'' (1594–96)]]

'''Sight-reading''', also called '''''a prima vista''''' (Italian meaning "at first sight"), is the [[reading (activity)|reading]] and performing of a piece of [[music]] or song in [[music notation]] that the performer has not seen before. '''Sight-singing''' is used to describe a singer who is sight-reading. Both activities require the musician to play or sing the notated rhythms and pitches. Many believe that sight-singing is the more challenging of the two, because singers do not have any keys, frets or valves (on keyboard instruments, guitars, and valved brass instruments, respectively) to help them obtain the correct pitches. Singers must also read and sing the correct lyrics, which adds another layer beyond pitch and dynamics. However, difficulty is related both to the instrument and the difficulty of the piece itself. For instance, sight-reading on a polyphonic instrument, such as the classical guitar, can be more challenging due to the fact that the guitarist has to read polyrhythms and polyphonic passages that can often be played in different positions using different frets.

==Terminology==

===Sight-reading===
People in music literature commonly use the term "sight-reading" generically for "the ability to read and produce both instrumental and vocal music at first sight […] the conversion of musical information from sight to sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Udtaisuk|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udtaisuk and some other authors prefer the use of the more specific terms "sight-playing" and "sight-singing" where applicable. This differentiation leaves a third, more restricted use of the term "sight-reading" for the silent reading of music without creating sound by instrument or voice.

Highly skilled musicians can sight-read ''silently''; that is, they can look at the printed music and hear it in their heads without playing or singing (see [[audiation]]).&lt;ref&gt;True sight-reading or sight-singing—not code-deciphering—is actually ''notational'' audiation.&lt;/ref&gt; Less able sight-readers generally must at least hum or whistle in order to sight-read effectively. This distinction is analogous to ordinary prose reading in [[late antiquity]], when the ability to read silently was notable enough for St. [[Augustine]] to comment on it. &lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manguel|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''a prima vista'' is also used, as Italian words and phrases are commonly used in music and music notation. To play a musical piece ''a prima vista'' means to play it 'at first sight'. According to Payne, "the ability to hear the notes on the page is clearly akin to music reading and should be considered a prerequisite for effective performance.... Egregious errors can occur when a student, analyzing a piece of music, makes no effort to play or hear the composition but mechanically processes the notes on the page".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Payne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to sight-read is important for all musicians, even amateur performers, but with professional [[orchestra]] musicians and [[session musicians]], it is an essential professional skill. Some professional orchestras require sight-reading as part of an audition.

===Sight transposition===
{{main|Sight transposition}}
Some musicians can [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] music during performance to suit particular instruments or vocal ranges, to make the playing of the instrument(s) or singing easier, or a number of other uses.

===Sight-playing===
According to Udtaisuk, "many [authors] use the term sight-playing for instrumental sight-reading performance." However, Udtaisuk and some other authors use the more descriptive term "sightplaying" (or "sight-playing") for instrumental sight-reading, because sight-playing combines two unique skill sets: music reading and music making.

===Sight-singing===
Some authors, according to Udtaisuk, use the term "sight-singing" for vocal sight-reading. As with sight-playing, Udtaisuk advocates and uses the more descriptive term "sightsinging" for vocal sight-reading because sight-singing combines sight-reading and singing skills.

==Psychology==
The ability to sight-read partly depends on a strong [[Short-term memory|short-term musical memory]]. An experiment on sight reading using an [[eye tracker]] indicates that highly skilled musicians tend to look ahead further in the music, storing and processing the notes until they are played; this is referred to as the [[eye–hand span]].

Storage of notational information in working memory can be expressed in terms of the amount of information (load) and the time for which it must be held before being played (latency). The relationship between load and latency changes according to tempo, such that t = x/y, where t is the change in tempo, x is the change in load, and y is the change in latency. Some teachers and researchers have proposed that the eye–hand span can be trained to be larger than it would otherwise be under normal conditions, leading to more robust sight-reading ability.

[[Human memory]] can be divided into three broad categories: long-term memory, sensory memory, and short-term (working) memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is "a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension." The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and sensory memory is this system's ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a
"limited capacity", so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.

Experiments dealing with memory span have been conducted by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] in 1956 that indicated, "Most common number of items that can be stored in the working memory is five plus or minus two.” However, if this information is not retained and stored (“consolidated”) in one's long-term memory, it will fade quickly.

Research indicates that the main area of the brain associated with the working memory is the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. This area deals with cognition and contains two major neural loops or pathways that are central to processing tasks via the working memory: the visual loop, which is necessary for the visual component of the task, and the phonological loop, which deals with the linguistic aspects of the task (i.e. repeating the word or phrase). Although the [[hippocampus]], in the temporal lobe, is the brain structure most frequently paired with memories, studies have indicated that its role is more vital for consolidation of the short-term memories into long-term ones than the ability to process, carry out, and briefly recall certain tasks.

This type of memory has specifically come into focus when discussing sight reading, since the process of looking at musical notes for the first time and deciphering them while playing an instrument can be considered a complex task of comprehension. The main conclusion in terms of this idea is that working memory and short-term memory capacity and mental speed are three important predictors for sight reading achievement. Although none of the studies discredits the correlation between the amount of time one spends practicing and musical ability, specifically sight-reading proficiency, more studies are pointing to the level at which one’s working memory functions as the key factor in sight-reading abilities. As stated in one such study, "Working memory capacity made a statistically significant contribution as well (about 7 percent, a medium-size effect). In other words, if you took two pianists with the same amount of practice, but different levels of working memory capacity, it's likely that the one higher in working memory capacity would have performed considerably better on the sight-reading task."

Based on the research and opinions of multiple musicians and scientists, the take home message about one's sight-reading ability and working memory capacity seems to be that “The best sight-readers combined strong working memories with tens of thousands of hours of practice.”

Sight-reading also depends on familiarity with the musical idiom being performed; this permits the reader to recognize and process frequently occurring patterns of notes as a single unit, rather than individual notes, thus achieving greater efficiency. This phenomenon, which also applies to the reading of language, is referred to as [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Errors in sight-reading tend to occur in places where the music contains unexpected or unusual sequences; these defeat the strategy of "reading by expectation" that sight-readers typically employ.

==Professional use==
Studio [[musician]]s (e.g., musicians employed to record pieces for [[Advertising|commercials]], etc.) often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. Often, the music played on [[television]] is played by musicians who are sight-reading. This practice has developed through intense commercial competition in these industries.

McNerney, jazz musician, professor, and private instructor, describes auditions for [[University of North Texas]] Jazz Lab Bands as being almost completely based on sight-reading: "you walk into a room and see three or four music stands in front of you, each with a piece of music on it (in different styles ...). You are then asked to read each piece in succession."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McNerney|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on sight-reading, according to McNerney, prepares musicians for studio work "playing backing tracks for pop performers or recording [commercials]."  The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential.  Typically, a studio performance is "rehearsed" only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance. They are known as "rehearsal bands", even though their performance is the rehearsal.

According to Frazier, score reading is an important skill for those interested in the conducting profession and "Conductors such as the late [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Yoel Levi]] have incredibly strong piano skills and can read at sight full orchestral scores at the piano" (a process which requires the pianist to make an instant [[piano reduction]] of the key parts of the score).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frazier|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
Although 86% of piano teachers polled rated sight-reading as the most important or a highly important skill, only 7% of them said they address it systematically. Reasons cited were a lack of knowledge of how to teach it, inadequacy of the training materials they use, and deficiency in their own sight-reading skills. Teachers also often emphasize rehearsed reading and repertoire building for successful recitals and auditions to the detriment of sight-reading and other functional skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hardy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy reviewed research on piano sight-reading pedagogy and identified a number of specific skills essential to sight-reading proficiency:
* Technical fundamentals in reading and [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]
* [[Creative visualization|Visualization]] of keyboard topography
* [[Touch|Tactile]] facility (psychomotor skills) and memory
* Ability to read, recognize, and remember groups of notes (directions, patterns, phrases, [[chord (music)|chords]], [[rhythm]]ic groupings, [[theme (music)|themes]], [[Inversion (music)|inversions]], [[interval (music)|intervals]], etc.)
* Ability to read and remember ahead of playing with more and wider progressive fixations
* Aural imagery (ear-playing and sight-singing improves sight-reading)
* Ability to keep the basic pulse, read, and remember rhythm
* Awareness and knowledge of the music's structure and theory

Beauchamp (1999) identifies five building blocks in the development of piano sight-reading skills:
# [[Grand staff|Grand-staff]] knowledge
# Security within the five finger positions
# Security with keyboard topography
# Security with basic accompaniment patterns
# Understanding of basic fingering principles

Grand-staff knowledge consists of fluency in both clefs such that reading a note evokes an automatic and immediate physical response to the appropriate position on the keyboard. Beauchamp asserts it is better to sense and know where the note is than what the note is. The performer does not have time to think of the note name and translate it to a position, and the non-scientific [[Musical note|note]] name does not indicate the [[octave]] to be played. Beauchamp reports success using a Key/Note Visualizer, note-reading flashcards, and computer programs in group and individual practice to develop grand-staff fluency.

Udtaisuk also reports that a sense of keyboard geography and an ability to quickly and efficiently match notes to keyboard keys is important for sight-reading. He found that "computer programs and flash cards are effective ways to teach students to identify notes [and] enhance a sense of keyboard geography by highlighting the relationships between the keyboard and the printed notation."

Most students do not sight-read well because it requires specific instruction, which is seldom given. A major challenge in sight-reading instruction, according to Hardy, is obtaining enough practice material. Since practicing rehearsed reading does not help improve sight-reading, a student can only use a practice piece once. Moreover, the material must be at just the right level of difficulty for each student, and a variety of styles is preferred. Hardy suggests music teachers cooperate to build a large lending library of music and purchase inexpensive music from garage sales and store sales.

==Assessment and standards==
In some circumstances, such as examinations, the ability of a student to sight-read is assessed by presenting the student with a short piece of music, with an allotted time to peruse the music, then testing the student on the accuracy of the performance.  A more challenging test requires the student to perform without any preparation at all.

The [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning]] has piloted a classroom based assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to sight-sing or perform on instruments from sheet music they have written. It is suggested that students use [[solfege]] or numbering systems or fingering without instruments as aids. 8th graders are expected to sing by sight: "Students are asked to perform a sight-singing exercise of four measures of music. Students will be assessed on their understanding of rhythm and steady beat and their ability to perform in the designated key with accurate interval changes, acappella."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/Arts/CBPANewRevised2009.aspx "Arts Revised Classroom-Based Performance Assessment (CBPA)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many students and adults cannot sight-sing, and even some professional singers cannot sing by sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, in combination with an assessment which requires composing music on a staff as early as 5th grade, it is hoped that such a requirement will raise arts achievement. Pilot data show that many students can meet or exceed such standards.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The Standard Assessment of Sight Reading (SASR) is a non-subjective sight reading evaluation method. It was created with a scientific/electronic platform to insure a non-subjective approach to grading and administering that test.  It consists of several thousand pieces of music over 80 graded levels of difficulty that have been reviewed by 135 teachers and students to ascertain the correct difficulty levels.  Their scores were averaged electronically in order to insure a scientific approach to graduating the difficulty levels of the music.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

A '''simulacrum''' ([[plural]]: '''simulacra''' from {{lang-la|simulacrum}}, which means "likeness, similarity") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Word of the Day |date=1 May 2003 |publisher=dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217130815/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |archivedate=17 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.&lt;ref&gt;"simulacrum" ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] offers [[photorealism]] as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is sometimes created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"&gt;Massumi, Brian.

==Philosophy==
Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', [[Plato]] speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek statuary]], which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a [[metaphor]] for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plato |title=The Sophist |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |chapter=Reason in Philosophy |title=Twilight of the Idols |others=Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale |year=1888 |url=http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426104633/http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodernism/Philosophy|Postmodernist]] French [[social theorist]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Simulacra and Simulations"&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html Baudrillard Simulacra] retrieved 2 May 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=9 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, [[Gilles Deleuze]], takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or "privileged position" could be "challenged and overturned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deleuze |first=Gilles |title=Difference and Repetition |others=Translated by Paul Patton |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Columbia |year=1968 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze defines simulacra as "those systems in which different relates to different ''by means of'' difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no ''prior [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'', no ''internal resemblance''".&lt;ref&gt;p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]], in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Ethics - An Essay on the Understanding of Evil|others=Translated by Peter Hallward |publisher=Verso |location=London |year=2001 |pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')".

==Recreation==
Recreational simulacra include [[historical reenactment|reenactments of historical events]] or replicas of landmarks, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as [[Fantasyland]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that [[Walt Disney World Resort]] is a copy of a copy, "a simulacrum to the second power".&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ "Disneyworld Company."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152759/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ |date=27 May 2010 }} retrieved 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] argued that at Disney's parks, "we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''Travels in Hyperreality.'' Reproduced in relevant portion at
[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html "The City of Robots"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912200642/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html |date=12 September 2006 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of [[national park]]s, [[Disney's Wilderness Lodge]], environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and [[anthropologist]] Eric Higgs expressed worry that "the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value".&lt;ref&gt;Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html "Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704185846/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html |date=4 July 2007 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist [[Paul McCarthy]] has created entire installations based on ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.

==Caricature==
An interesting example of simulacrum is [[caricature]]. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.

==Iconography==
Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;11) employs the term "simulacrum" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether [[iconic]] or [[aniconic]], in the landscape or greater field of [[Thangka]] art and Tantric Buddhist [[iconography]]. For example, an iconographic [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a [[sacred mountain]] in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an "auspicious canopy" (Sanskrit: [[Chhatra]]) of the [[Ashtamangala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Robert |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-416-2 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] approach a [[cultural universal]] and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the [[human psychology]].

==Word usage==
The Latinised plural ''simulacra'' is interchangeable with the anglicised version ''simulacrums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |title=simulacrum |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712155454/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of race and ethnic relations''' is the study of [[social]], [[political]], and [[economic]] relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of [[society]]. This area encompasses the study of systemic [[racism]], like [[residential segregation]] and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. The sociological analysis of race and ethnicity frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as, but not limited to, [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]].

At the level of political policy, ethnic relations is discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]]. [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  At the level of academic inquiry, ethnic relations is discussed either by the experiences of individual racial-ethnic groups or else by overarching theoretical issues.

==Classical Theorists==

===Marx===

[[Marx]] described society as having nine "great" classes, the capitalist class and the working class, with the middle classes falling in behind one or the other as they see fit. He hoped for the working class to rise up against the capitalist class in an attempt to stop the exploitation of the working class. He blamed part of their failure to organize on the capitalist class, as they separated black and white laborers. This separation, specifically between Blacks and Whites in America,  contributed to racism. Marx attributes [[capitalism]]'s contribution to racism through segmented labor markets and a racial inequality of earnings.&lt;ref name="Bohmer"&gt;Bohmer, Peter. 1998. [http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/marxracism.html    Marxist Theory of Racism and Racial Inequality].  Readings in Black Political Economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weber===
[[Weber]] laid the foundations for a micro-sociology of ethnic relations beginning in 1906.  Weber argued that biological traits could not be the basis for group foundation unless they were conceived as shared characteristics. It was this shared perception and common customs that create and distinguish one ethnicity from another.  This differs from the views of many of his contemporaries who believed that an ethnic group was formed from biological similarities alone apart from social perception of membership in a group.&lt;ref name="Banton"&gt;Banton, Michael. 2008. The Sociology of Ethnic Relations. ''Ethnic and Racial Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===W.E.B. Du Bois===
[[W.E.B. Du Bois]] is well known as one of the most influential black scholars and activists of the 20th century. Du Bois educated himself on his people, and sought academia as a way to enlighten others on the social injustices against his people. Du Bois research "revealed the [[Negro]] group as a symptom, not a cause; as a striving, palpitating group, and not an inert, sick body of crime; as a long historic development and not a transient occurrence".&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;Du Bois, W.E.B. 1940. Dusk of dawn; an essay toward an autobiography of a race concept. Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois believed that Black Americans should embrace higher education and use their new access to schooling to achieve a higher position within society. He referred to this idea as the [[Talented Tenth]]. With gaining popularity, he also preached the belief that for blacks to be free in some places, they must be free everywhere. After traveling to Africa and Russia, he recanted his original philosophy of integration and acknowledged it as a long term vision.&lt;ref name="Hynes"&gt;Hynes, Gerald. ????.

===Booker T. Washington===

[[Booker T. Washington]] was considered one of the most influential black educators of the 19th and 20th centuries. Born in 1856 as a slave in Virginia, Washington came of age as slavery was coming to an end.  Just as slavery ended, however, it was replaced by a system of sharecropping in the South that resulted in black indebtedness.  With growing discrimination in the South following the end of the Reconstruction era, Washington felt that the key to advancing in America rested with getting an education and improving one's economic well-being, not with political advancement.  Consequently, in 1881, he founded the [[Tuskegee Institute]], now Tuskegee University, in order to provide individuals with an education that would help them to find employment in the growing industrial sector. By focusing on education for blacks, rather than political advancement, he gained financial support from whites for his cause.  Secretly, however, he pursued legal challenges against segregation and disfranchisement of blacks.&lt;ref name="Harlen"&gt;Harlen, Louis. 1972.

== Modern Theorists ==

=== Patricia Hill Collins ===
[[Patricia Hill Collins]] is currently a Distinguished University Professor Emerita at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. She received her PhD in sociology in 1984 from [[Brandeis University]]. Collins was the president-elect for the [[American Sociological Association]], where she was the 100th president and the first African-American woman to be president of the organization. Collins is a social theorist whose work and research primarily focuses on race, social class, sexuality, and gender. She has written a number of books and articles on said topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Collins/Patricia%20Hill|title=Patricia Hill Collins {{!}} SOCY l Sociology Department l University of Maryland|website=socy.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins work focuses on [[Intersectionality]], by looking at issues through the lens of women of color. In her work, she writes "First, we need new visions of what oppression is, new categories of analysis that are inclusive of race, class, and gender as distinctive yet interlocking structures of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|date=1993|title=Toward a New Vision: Race, Class, and Gender as Categories of Analysis and Connection|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41680038|journal=Race, Sex &amp; Class|volume=1|issue=1|pages=25–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eduardo Bonilla-Silva ===
[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] is currently a professor of sociology at [[Duke University]] and is the 2018 president of the American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/leadership|title=Leadership|date=2009-05-23|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD in 1993 from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], which is where he met his mentor, Professor [[Charles Camic]], of which he said "Camic believed in me and told me, just before graduation, that I should stay in the states as I would contribute greatly to American sociology." Bonilla-Silva did not start off his work as a "race scholar," but originally was trained in [[class analysis]], [[political sociology]], and sociology of development ([[globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.duke.edu/people/eduardo-bonilla-silva|title=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva {{!}} Duke Sociology|website=sociology.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s when he joined a student movement calling for racial justice at the University of Wisconsin that he began his work in race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/footnotes/sep-oct-2017/features/introducing-eduardo-bonilla-silva-2018-asa-president|title=Introducing Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, 2018 ASA President|date=2017-10-29|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, [[Racism without Racists]], Bonilla-Silva discusses less overt racism, which he refers to as "new racism," which disguises itself "under the cloak of legality" in order to accomplish the same things. He also discusses "color-blind racism," which is essentially when people go off the basis that we have achieved equality and deny past and present discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973481548|title=Racism without racists : color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America|last=1962-|first=Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo,|isbn=9781442276222|edition= Fifth|location=Lanham|oclc=973481548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==
[[File:Racistcampaignposter1.jpg|thumb|A racist political campaign poster from the 1866 [[Pennsylvania]] [[governor|gubernatorial]] election]]

One of the most important social psychological findings concerning race relations is that members of stereotyped groups internalize those stereotypes and thus suffer a wide range of harmful consequences.  For example, in a phenomenon called [[stereotype threat]], members of racial and ethnic groups that are stereotyped as scoring poorly on tests will perform poorer on those tests if they are reminded of this stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;"What is stereotype threat?" http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is so strong that even simply asking the test-taker to state her or his race before taking the test (such is by bubbling in "African American" on a multiple choice question) will significantly alter test performance.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Aronson. 1995. Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specifically sociological contribution to this line of research has found that such negative stereotypes can be created on the spot: an experiment by Michael Lovaglia et al.(1998) demonstrated that [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people can be made to suffer stereotype threat if they are led to believe that they are a disadvantaged group for a particular kind of test.&lt;ref name="Lovaglia"&gt;Lovaglia, Michael, JW Lucas, SR Thye. 1998. Status Processes and Mental Ability Test Scores. American Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism and psychoanalysis==

[[Psychoanalysis]] has much to offer the study of racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Pauline, politics and psychoanalysis: theorising racism in Australia|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/39156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central proposition is that rationality is not the natural state of the individual, and that individuals develop defence mechanisms to cope with anxiety. Humans resist change because change threatens established ways of dealing with anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frosch|first1=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis and Psychology: Minding the Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual defence mechanisms contribute to [[social defence]] mechanisms. The most regressive defence mechanism (the 'paranoid-schizoid' position) results in a complete dehumanising of the 'all-bad' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segal|first1=Hanna|title=Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'all-bad' group is admired as well as feared (often evident in the [[conspiracy theory]]). Paradoxically, the arbitrariness of the category 'race' enables the psychotic subject to invest more meaning in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rustin|first1=Michael|title=The Good Society and the Inner World: Psychoanalysis and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernity's attempt at rationalisation papers over a polycentric psyche (i.e. all of us still have anxieties and desires, despite our apparent rationality). Racism is a response to the abstracting logic of modernity. The rationality of western, 'white' society is defined in opposition to the 'animality' of black, 'primitive' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovel, Joel|editor1-last=Elliot|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Frosch|editor2-first=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis in Contexts: Paths between Theory and Modern Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychoanalytic theorists also argue that passionate anti-racism can produce psychological states analogous to racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"/&gt;

==Audit studies==
{{Main|audit study}}
Another important line of research on race takes the form of [[audit studies]].  The audit study approach creates an artificial pool of people among whom there are no average differences by race. For instance, groups of white and black auditors are matched on every category other than their race, and thoroughly trained to act in identical ways.  Given nearly identical resumes, they are sent to interview for the same jobs.  Simple comparisons of means can yield strong evidence regarding discrimination. The best known audit study in sociology is ''The Mark of a Criminal Record'' by [[Harvard University]] sociologist Devah Pager.  This study compares job prospects of black and white men who were recently released from jail.  Its key finding is that blacks are significantly discriminated against when applying for service jobs.  Moreover, whites ''with'' a criminal record have about the same prospect of getting an interview as blacks ''without'' one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pager|first1=D.|title=The Mark of a Criminal Record|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|date=March 2003|volume=108|issue=5|pages=937–975|doi=10.1086/374403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another recent audit by [[UCLA]] sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high quality state higher education institutions.  This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=S. M.|title=Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market|journal=[[Social Forces]]|date=June 2015|volume=93|issue=4|pages=1451–1479|doi=10.1093/sf/sou111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline development by country==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the study of racial and ethnic relations has been widely influenced by the factors associated with each major wave of [[immigration]] as the incoming group struggles with keeping its own cultural and ethnic identity while also assimilating into the broader mainstream [[American culture]] and [[Economy of the United States|economy]].  One of the first and most prevalent topics within American study is that of the relations between white Americans and [[African Americans]] due to the heavy [[collective memory]] and culture borne out of and lingering from centuries of forced [[slavery]] in [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].   Throughout the rest of American history, each new wave of [[immigration to the United States]] has brought another set of issues as the tension between maintaining [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] takes on new shapes.  [[Racism]] and conflict often rears up during these times.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;Park, Robert Ezra. 1950. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcVlv2HTj8C&amp;pg=PR5 The Early Sociology of Race and Ethnicity]. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some key currents can be gleaned from this body of knowledge: in the context of the United States, there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns or retractability of American identities have erupted to the fore of America's political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=American Social ‘Reminders’ of Citizenship after September 11, 2001: Nativisms in the Ethnocratic Retractability of American Identity|journal=Qualitative Sociology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable and infamous examples can be seen in [[Executive Order 9066]] that [[Internment of Japanese Americans|placed Japanese Americans in incarceration centers]] as well as the 19th century [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that banned Chinese laborers from emigrating to the United States (local workers viewed Chinese laborers as a threat). Current examples include post-[[9/11]] backlash against Muslim Americans, although these have taken place in civil society, not through public policy.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], foreign nationals were actively encouraged and sponsored to migrate in the 1950s after the dissolution of [[British Empire|the Empire]] and the social devastation of the [[Second World War]]. The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] changed the law so that only certain [[British Commonwealth]] members were able to migrate. This law was tightened again with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] and [[Immigration Act 1971]]. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] extended certain anti-discrimination policies with respect to employment, housing, commercial and other services. This was extended again with the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].

As with the UK establishments of [[media studies|media]] and [[cultural studies]], 'ethnic relations' is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline either within sociology departments or other schools of humanities.

Major British theorists include [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], Richard Jenkins, [[John Rex]], [[Michael Banton]] and [[Tariq Modood]].

[[Image:Systems thinking about the society.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Impression of systems thinking about society]]

'''Systems science''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that studies the nature of [[system]]s—from simple to complex—in [[nature]], [[society]], [[cognition]], [[engineering]], [[technology]] and [[science]] itself. To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems.&lt;ref&gt; G. E. Mobus &amp; M. C. Kalton, ''Principles of Systems Science'', 2015, New York:Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The field aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business management, engineering,  and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip M'Pherson]] (1974, p. 229); as cited by: Hieronymi, A. (2013), Understanding Systems Science: A Visual and Integrative Approach. ''Syst. Res.''. {{doi|10.1002/sres.2215}}. He defined systems science as "the ordered arrangement of knowledge acquired from the study of systems in the observable world, together with the application of this knowledge to the design of man-made systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems science covers [[formal sciences]] such as [[complex systems]], [[cybernetics]], [[dynamical systems theory]], [[information theory]], [[linguistics]] or [[systems theory]]. It has applications in the field of the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as [[control theory]], [[operations research]], social systems theory, [[systems biology]], [[system dynamics]], [[human factors]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems engineering]] and [[systems psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Francis Heylighen]] in "What are Cybernetics and Systems Science?" on ''Principia Cybernetica Web'' (1999) systems science is an "[[Fields of science|academic domain]], that touches virtually all traditional disciplines, from [[mathematics]], [[technology]] and [[biology]] to [[philosophy]] and the [[social sciences]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various '[[boundary conditions]]' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

== Theories ==
Since the emergence of [[Systems theory|general systems research]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Flood]] (1993) ''Dealing with Complexity: : An Introduction to the Theory and Application of Systems Science.'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems theory|systems thinking]] and systems science have developed into many [[theoretical]] frameworks.
[[Image:Henk Bikker 1991.jpg|thumb|240px|Systems notes of Henk Bikker, [[TU Delft]], 1991]]
;Systems analysis
:[[Systems analysis]] is the branch of systems science that analyzes systems, the interactions within those systems, and/or interaction with its environment,&lt;ref name="AD 1971"&gt;Anthony Debons. "Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact" in:  ''Advances in computers,'' Vol. 11. Franz L. Alt &amp; Morris Rubinoff eds. (1971). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; often prior to their automation as computer models. This field is closely related to [[operations research]].
;Systems design
:Systems design is the process of "establishing and specifying the optimum system component configuration for achieving specific goal or objective."&lt;ref name="AD 1971"/&gt; For example in computing, systems design can define the [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[systems architecture]]  which includes many sub-architectures including [[software]] architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and [[data]], as well as security, information, and others,  for a [[computer system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s.
;System dynamics
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behavior of [[complex system]]s over time. It offers "simulation technique for modeling business and social systems,"&lt;ref&gt;Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation Argonne National Laboratory (2007) ''Managing Business Complexity : Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation: Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation.'' Oxford University Press. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behavior of the entire system.  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying complex systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].
;Systems engineering
:[[Systems engineering]] (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of [[engineering]], that focuses on the development and organization of complex [[system]]s. It is the "art and science of creating whole solutions to complex problems,"&lt;ref&gt;Derek K. Hitchins (2008) ''Systems Engineering: A 21st Century Systems Methodology.'' p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  for example: [[signal processing]] systems, [[control system]]s and [[communication system]], or other forms of high-level modelling and design in specific fields of engineering.
;Systems methodologies
:There are several types of Systems Methodologies, that is, disciplines for analysis of systems. For example:
:* [[Soft systems methodology]] (SSM) : in the field of organizational studies is an approach to organisational process modelling, and it can be used both for general [[problem]] solving and in the management of change. It was developed in [[England]] by academics at the [[University of Lancaster]] Systems Department through a ten-year Action Research programme.
:* [[System development methodology]] (SDM) in the field of IT development is a variety of structured, organized processes for developing information technology and embedded software systems.
:* [[Viable systems approach]] (vSa) is a methodology useful for the understanding and governance of complex phenomena; it has been successfully proposed in the field of management, decision making, marketing and service.
;Systems theories
:[[Systems theory]] is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[complex system]]s in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]].  More specifically, it is a conceptual framework by which one can analyze and/or describe any group of objects that work in concert to produce some result.
;Systems science
:Systems sciences are scientific disciplines partly based on systems thinking such as [[chaos theory]], [[complex systems]], [[control theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[sociotechnical systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[systems chemistry]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems psychology]] and the already mentioned systems dynamics, systems engineering, and systems theory.

== Systems scientists ==
{{Main|List of systems scientists}}
General systems scientists can be divided into different generations. The founders of the systems movement like [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], [[James Grier Miller]], [[George J. Klir]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]] were all born between 1900 and 1920. They all came from different natural and social science disciplines and joined forces in the 1950s to establish the general systems theory [[paradigm]]. Along with the organization of their efforts a first generation of systems scientists rose.

Among them were other scientists like Ackoff, Ashby, Margaret Mead and Churchman, who popularized the systems concept in the 1950s and 1960s. These scientists inspired and educated a second generation with more notable scientists like [[Ervin Laszlo]] (1932) and [[Fritjof Capra]] (1939), who wrote about systems theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Others got acquainted and started studying these works in the 1980s and started writing about it since the 1990s. [[Debora Hammond]] can be seen as a typical representative of these third generation of general systems scientists.

== Organizations ==
{{Main|List of systems sciences organizations}}

The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]] (ISSS) is an organisation for interdisciplinary collaboration and synthesis of systems sciences. The ISSS is unique among systems-oriented institutions in terms of the breadth of its scope, bringing together scholars and practitioners from academic, business, government, and non-profit organizations. Based on fifty years of tremendous interdisciplinary research from the scientific study of complex systems to interactive approaches in management and community development. This society was initially conceived in 1954 at the Stanford [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]].

In the field of systems science the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of systems science. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational [[non-profit organization|agency]] founded in 1981, and constituted of some thirty member organizations from various countries. The overall purpose of this Federation is to advance [[cybernetic]] and [[systems research]] and systems applications and to serve the international systems community.

The best known research institute in the field is the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States, dedicated to the study of [[complex systems]]. This institute was founded in 1984 by [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a separate [[interdisciplinary]] research area, [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] referred to at SFI as [[complexity science]]. Recently, [[IIT Jodhpur]] in Rajasthan, India started inculcating system science and engineering to its students through Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate programs. This makes it the first institution to offer [[system science]] education to students in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4413">{{For|other uses of the phrase "Book of Secrets"|Book of Secrets (disambiguation)}}

The '''''Book of Mysteries''''' (also known as the '''''Book of Secrets''''') is an ancient [[Essenes|Essene]] text found in fragmentary form among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The scroll fragments are given the [[alphanumeric]] designations of 1Q27 and 4Q299-301.

==Wisdom literature==
''The Book of Mysteries'' is closely related to another unnamed [[Wisdom literature|wisdom book]] found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], variously called ''[[The Secret of the Way Things Are]]'' or the ''Sapiential Work''. In both texts, the term ''raz'' occurs frequently. ''Raz'' means "mystery" or "secret", and is defined as a type of wisdom or knowledge that is known by God and can only be known by humans by divine revelation.{{sfn|Harrington|2000|p=588-589}} This word often occurs in the phrase ''raz nihyeh'', which can be translated as "the secret of the way things are".{{sfn|Wise, Abegg and Cook|2005|p=109}} The assumption behind ''The Book of Mysteries'' is that [[revelation]], not reason, is the key to wisdom. The book is authored by an unnamed teacher who claims to be the recipient of such a revelation and is passing it along to his students.

==Origins==
As with many of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the question of who wrote the scrolls and when has no definite answer. Dates as to when the manuscripts were copied can only be estimated. The copy of mystery text 1Q27 has been dated on [[paleography|paleographic]] grounds to the end of the first century BCE, so the book is at least that old.{{sfn|Larson|2000|p=587}} [[Lawrence Schiffman]] believes that the ideology, orthography and language of the texts show that it originates from the same circle as other sectarian works found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.{{sfn|Larson|2000|p=588}}

The tone of the writing reflects an elite group which believes that it alone holds the correct understanding of [[YHWH]]'s plan for the universe and how to please him so as to be saved from the fate of the ignorant and hypocritical. Much of ''The Book of Mysteries'' appears to be a teaching of correction against those who do not live righteously in the author's eyes. They warn of the hypocrisy of nations, the false knowledge of magicians, and the wrath of God upon sinners. They especially warn against the fate of those who do not recognize the divine mysteries.

==Last days==
The [[eschatology]] of the book is rather unusual. The end time described by the author does not manifest itself in the normal culmination of a battle, judgment or catastrophe, but rather as "a steady increase of light, [through which] darkness is made to disappear or in which iniquity dissolves and just as the smoke rising into the air eventually dissipates".{{sfn|Piper|1958|p=97}} In this sense, wisdom is an inevitable force that needs to be yielded to by those who choose to accept it and are capable of understanding it. There is no mention of angels, or YHWH's coming, or resurrection of the wise, or any of the typical [[messianism|messianic]] language that is usually associated with Judeo-Christian eschatological texts. It simply argues for a change in focus from folly to wisdom, and therefore righteousness.

'''''The Faith of Our Fathers: a Plain Exposition and Vindication of the Church Founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ''''' is a book by archbishop [[James Gibbons]] which was published in Baltimore in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0pM77M1OrkrTDGast4&amp;id=uIVNCtk5bSwC&amp;pg=PA3 The Faith of Our Fathers]''&lt;/ref&gt; which became a best-selling conversion manual in the [[United States]] and by 1980 was in its 111th printing. 

In his 1917 preface to the 83rd edition, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] noted that "since the first edition appeared, in 1876 up to the present time, fourteen hundred thousand copies have been published and the circulation of the book is constantly increasing. The work has been translated into nearly all the [[languages of Europe]]." The well-known agnostic, literary critic and fellow Baltimorean [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote, in his survey of religion ''Treatise on the Gods'', that "the best exposition of [[Catholic]] doctrine is probably ''The Faith of our Fathers''', by the late Cardinal Gibbons."

The '''V. G. Khlopin Radium Institute''', also known as the '''First Radium Institute''', is a research and production institution located in [[Saint Petersburg]] specializing in the fields of [[nuclear physics]], [[radiochemistry|radio-]] and [[geochemistry]], and on [[ecology|ecological topics]], associated with the problems of nuclear power engineering, [[radioecology]], and [[isotope]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istc.ru/istc/db/inst.nsf/wsu/i0001614?OpenDocument&amp;lang=Eng Institution] – ISTC.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subsidiary company of the [[Rosatom]] Russian state corporation.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;V.

The '''''Westmorland''''' or '''''Westmoreland'''''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes referred to as [[His Majesty's Ship|HMS]] Westmoreland/Westmorland.  However, according to ''[[Ships of the Royal Navy]]'', like most other privateers she was never actually [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a 26-gun British [[privateer]] [[frigate]], operating in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] against French shipping in retaliation for France's opposition to Great Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Service history==

The most notable incident in the life of the ''Westmorland'' occurred shortly after she sailed for Britain from [[Livorno]] under Captain Michael Wallace late in 1778, carrying a large monetary payment for her inbound cargo of salt cod from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Livorno was a trade hub for this commodity), food goods,&lt;ref&gt;These included almost 4000 barrels of anchovies, 129 pounds of silk, 150 crates of manna and oil, thirty-four bales of hemp, thirty-two Parmesan cheeses, twenty-two barrels of Tartar salt and medicines and five crates of artificial flowers.&lt;/ref&gt; and 57 crates of artistic objects collected by [[Grand Tour]]ists such as the [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], [[Sir John Henderson, 5th Baronet|Sir John Henderson]] and the [[Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Including Batoni's portrait of Charles Cecil Roberts and a second portrait called An English Gentleman; sculptures by [[Albacini]] and [[Christopher Hewetson]]; a marble chimney originally destined for the Duke of Gloucester; musical scores, violins, violin strings, hats (two barrels), ornamental fans, expensive books; [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] sketches; specimens of lava from [[Mount Vesuvius]] sent by [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]; relics; paintings by [[Pompeo Batoni]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], [[Carlo Maratta]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Guercino]], among others; modern copies of [[Raphael]]'s paintings; drawings by artists working in Rome, including [[John Robert Cozens]]; 23 crates of ancient Roman marble statues and fragments, plus modern plaster casts; other carved marble mantelpieces, slabs of coloured marble for table-tops, full-sized Piranesi-like "vasi candelabri", 84 rolls of deluxe blank Genoa paper, a crate of flowering onion bulbs and seeds; boxes of pomade, sweetmeats and citrus-blossom water, four barrels of Madeira, and a double-barreled rifle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1779,&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox. ''The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, An Episode of the Grand Tour.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; she was given chase by four French ships, comprising two men-of-war, the [[French ship Caton (1778)|''Caton'']] (64) and the [[French ship Destin (1778)|''Destin'']] (74), and two smaller vessels.  Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet&amp;nbsp;— in formal terms at least&amp;nbsp;— at war with Britain) to continue to [[Málaga]].

[[File:Mengs, Perseus befreit Andromeda.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Perseus And Andromeda'' by Mengs, another painting captured from the ''Westmorland'' ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]
At Málaga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of "extremely precious goods" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the [[Count of Floridablanca]], of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver [[Spanish real|reales]] (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold [[doubloon]]s, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Lewisham]], meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister.

Although the British consul at [[Cadiz]] had initially informed the [[British Admiralty]] that the ''Westmorland'' and her cargo had been seized as legitimate [[prize ship|prizes]], demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the [[Royal Navy]]) the crew of the ''Westmorland''. Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Real Academia]], and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's ''Perseus and Andromeda'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Mengs]], which ended up in the collection of [[Catherine the Great]] at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

In 1784, the £100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London.  The ''Westmorland'', for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the [[Caribbean]] by the British.

In 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]] and then traveled to the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=Revealed: Grand Tour loot of the Presa Inglesa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/20/grand-tour-loot-presa-inglesa|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vickery|first=Amanda|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/04/cargo-culture-grand-tour-unpacked |title=The captured cargo that unpacks the spirit of the grand tour|accessdate=4 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox.
