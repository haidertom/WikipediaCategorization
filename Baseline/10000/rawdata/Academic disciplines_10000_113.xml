[[File:Laura Bush talks with African boy.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Laura Bush]] with an [[AIDS orphan]] at a center in [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|Zambia]] that promotes abstinence and faith for youth.]]
'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.

Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b |pmid=17885460 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |year=2007 |last1=Ott |first1=Mary A |last2=Santelli |first2=John S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.006 |pmid=22341164 |title=The Effectiveness of Group-Based Comprehensive Risk-Reduction and Abstinence Education Interventions to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Adolescent Pregnancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Sexually Transmitted Infections |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=272–94 |year=2012 |last1=Chin |first1=Helen B |last2=Sipe |first2=Theresa Ann |last3=Elder |first3=Randy |last4=Mercer |first4=Shawna L |last5=Chattopadhyay |first5=Sajal K |last6=Jacob |first6=Verughese |last7=Wethington |first7=Holly R |last8=Kirby |first8=Doug |last9=Elliston |first9=Donna B |last10=Griffith |first10=Matt |last11=Chuke |first11=Stella O |last12=Briss |first12=Susan C |last13=Ericksen |first13=Irene |last14=Galbraith |first14=Jennifer S |last15=Herbst |first15=Jeffrey H |last16=Johnson |first16=Robert L |last17=Kraft |first17=Joan M |last18=Noar |first18=Seth M |last19=Romero |first19=Lisa M |last20=Santelli |first20=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Un2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2 |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Underhill |first1=Kristen |last2=Operario |first2=Don |last3=Montgomery |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or [[unplanned pregnancy]] when compared to comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;

The topic of abstinence-only education is controversial in the United States, with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity, and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aims.

==Description==
Abstinence education teaches children and [[adolescents]] to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). With a heavy focus on the importance of "family values," programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/edth.12034 |title=Just the Facts? The Separation of Sex Education from Moral Education |journal=Educational Theory |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=443–60 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17162310&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2006.tb00277.x |pmid=17162310 |title=Changes in Formal Sex Education: 1995?2002 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=182–9 |year=2006 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Santelli |first2=John S |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[Systematic review]]s of research evaluating abstinence-only sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing [[unwanted pregnancy]] or the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}} {{cite web |url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27677440&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17437199.2016.1240625 |pmid=27677440 |title=A comprehensive review of reviews of school-based interventions to improve sexual-health |journal=[[Health Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–52 |year=2016 |last1=Denford |first1=Sarah |last2=Abraham |first2=Charles |last3=Campbell |first3=Rona |last4=Busse |first4=Heide }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has recommended against the use of abstinence-only sex education because it has been found to be ineffective, and because the media frequently conveys information about non-abstinence.&lt;ref name=pmid20805150&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1544 |pmid=20805150 |title=Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=576–82 |year=2010 |last1=Strasburger |first1=V. C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STI transmission ===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that abstinence-focused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDs.&lt;ref name=pmid26149164&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1570162x13666150511143943 |pmid=26149164 |title=Effective Evidence-Based Programs for Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Current HIV Research |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=432–8 |year=2015 |last1=Petrova |first1=Dafina |last2=Garcia-Retamero |first2=Rocio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinence-only education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=Un2007/&gt; In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect.&lt;ref name=pmid24594648&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089692 |pmid=24594648 |pmc=3942389 |title=School Based Sex Education and HIV Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e89692 |year=2014 |last1=Fonner |first1=Virginia A |last2=Armstrong |first2=Kevin S |last3=Kennedy |first3=Caitlin E |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Kevin R |last5=Sweat |first5=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Douglas Kirby]] reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.3.18 |title=The impact of abstinence and comprehensive sex and STD/HIV education programs on adolescent sexual behavior |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=18 |year=2008 |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents.&lt;ref name=pmid21199984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251 |title=Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adolescents |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=165 |year=2011 |last1=Johnson |first1=Blair T |last2=Scott-Sheldon |first2=Lori A. J |last3=Huedo-Medina |first3=Tania B |last4=Carey |first4=Michael P |pmc=4361805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially life-saving information about sexual risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17441692.2012.759609 |pmid=23327516 |pmc=3984004 |title=Abstinence promotion under PEPFAR: The shifting focus of HIV prevention for youth |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2013 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Speizer |first2=Ilene S |last3=Edelstein |first3=Zoe R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found "that state-level abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates, although we find that state-level policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some states."&lt;ref name=pmid26918400&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hec.3315 |pmid=26918400 |title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes |journal=Health Economics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=403–420 |year=2017 |last1=Carr |first1=Jillian B |last2=Packham |first2=Analisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
Research conducted on 48 states of United States showed that "The level of abstinence education (no provision, covered, promoted, stressed) was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates.&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; Also, in John S. Santelli's research, the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during 1995&amp;ndash;2002 were largely due to improved contraception, and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of 18 or 19 is entirely ascribed to more contraception.&lt;ref name=pmid17138906&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.089169 |pmid=17138906 |pmc=1716232 |title=Explaining Recent Declines in Adolescent Pregnancy in the United States: The Contribution of Abstinence and Improved Contraceptive Use |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=150–6 |year=2007 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Lindberg |first2=Laura Duberstein |last3=Finer |first3=Lawrence B |last4=Singh |first4=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, "[s]cientific evidence simply does not support an abstinence-only-until-marriage approach."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens 15–19 reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Table 1.0,"U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions: National and State Trends and Trends by Race and Ethnicity." {{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129204657/http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}, downloaded 20100127.&lt;/ref&gt;

While sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex,&lt;ref name=pmid22999833&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.028 |pmid=22999833 |laysource=Guttmacher Institute |laysummary=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/sex-education-linked-delay-first-sex |laydate=March 8, 2012 |title=Consequences of Sex Education on Teen and Young Adult Sexual Behaviors and Outcomes |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=332–8 |year=2012 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Maddow-Zimet |first2=Isaac }}&lt;/ref&gt; abstinence-only programs specifically haven't shown this link, and do not seem to influence if or when young people begin having sex.&lt;ref name=pmid18346659&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026 |pmid=18346659 |title=Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=344–51 |year=2008 |last1=Kohler |first1=Pamela K |last2=Manhart |first2=Lisa E |last3=Lafferty |first3=William E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Support===
Proponents of abstinence-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=2012-03-10 }} Retrieved on 2007-14-03&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage, and therefore, that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14681811.2012.738604 |title=The use and misuse of pleasure in sex education curricula |journal=Sex Education |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=305–18 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon |last2=Lustig |first2=Kara |last3=Graling |first3=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage, which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views On Sex - And Sex Education - Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.

Proponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable STIs are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern. Many supporters of abstinence-only education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities,&lt;ref name=pmid22022362&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658 |pmid=22022362 |pmc=3194801 |title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e24658 |year=2011 |last1=Stanger-Hall |first1=Kathrin F |last2=Hall |first2=David W }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Contra-Contraception"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shorto |first=Russel |title=Contra-Contraception |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=March 18, 2017 |df= }}{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults. They are seen as unable to control themselves due to 'raging hormones'. As a result, a teenager's sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, J (2012). "Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide". ''Sociology Compass'': 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults: "the innocent and the guilty, the vulnerable and the predatory, the pure and the corrupting."&lt;ref&gt;Fields, p. 6{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition ===
Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents. Not only is information inadequate, but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.10.006 |pmid=16387256 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education: A review of U.S. Policies and programs |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2006 |last1=Santelli |first1=John |last2=Ott |first2=Mary A |last3=Lyon |first3=Maureen |last4=Rogers |first4=Jennifer |last5=Summers |first5=Daniel |last6=Schleifer |first6=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate information is especially important since, although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method, it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice it.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256/&gt;

Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education. Opponents of abstinence-only education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex.&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Douglas Kirby, Ph.

According to [[Advocates for Youth]], abstinence-only sex education distorts information about contraceptives, including only revealing failure rates associated with their use, and ignoring discussion of their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006; {{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419141940/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language surrounding medicine and health is construed  as being both objective and value free.&lt;ref name=pmid23468394/&gt; This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religion.&lt;ref name="Hawaii of Manoa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beh|first1=Hazel Glenn|last2=Diamond|first2=Milton|title=The Failure of Abstinence-only Education: minors have a right to honest talk about sex|journal=Columbia Journal of Gender and Law|date=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–62|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516171135/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|archivedate=16 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstinence-only education is not supported by the majority of public school teachers, parents, and students. The majority in each of these groups is opposed to abstinence-only curriculum and wants a more comprehensive curriculum. "Although more than nine in 10 teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception... one in four are instructed not to teach the subject." Even when there are no rules limiting sex education to abstinence-only, teachers may continue to teach abstinence-only curriculum because they fear retaliation from the local community. Parents also want their children to be taught about contraception. "Most parents (65%) believe that sex education should encourage young people to delay sexual activity but also prepare them to use birth control and practice safe sex once they do become sexually active." 86% of parents want schools to teach their children how to get STD testing, 77% want their children to learn how to talk to a partner about STDs and birth control, 71% want them to learn how to use condoms, and 68% want them to learn about using other forms of birth control. Students are also opposed to abstinence-only education. "Approximately half of students in grades 7-12 report needing more information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, how to get tested for HIV and other STDs, and how to talk with a partner about birth control and STDs." Clearly, there is a disparity between the type of sex education curriculum teachers, parents, and students want and what government policy determines they receive.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia.

=== Definition ===
Another problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like "postponing sex" or "never had [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]]," while also using moralistic terms or phrases like ''[[virgin]]'', ''chaste'', and "making a commitment".&lt;ref name="pmid16387256"/&gt; This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan Strong |author2=Christine DeVault |author3=Theodore F. Cohen |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationship in a Changing Society| publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2010|accessdate=October 8, 2011 |page=186| isbn=0-534-62425-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA186|quote=Most people agree that we maintain virginity as long as we refrain from sexual (vaginal) intercourse. But occasionally we hear people speak of 'technical virginity' [...] Data indicate that 'a very significant proportion of teens ha[ve] had experience with oral sex, even if they haven't had sexual intercourse, and may think of themselves as virgins' [...] Other research, especially research looking into virginity loss, reports that 35% of virgins, defined as people who have never engaged in vaginal intercourse, have nonetheless engaged in one or more other forms of heterosexual sexual activity (e.g., oral sex, anal sex, or mutual masturbation).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients. PEPFAR promotes an "ABC" approach – Abstain, Be faithful, and use Condoms.

PEPFAR was founded in 2003 with the mandate that 33% of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinence-only education.

=== Funding ===
In the U.S., states may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs from either Title V, the [[Adolescent Family Life Act]] (AFLA), and/or Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE).&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; To be eligible for funding, programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act, which is reproduced here verbatim:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026183857/http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funding, which began in the 1980s, has continued to increase since its inception, though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.517970 |title=Barack Obama vs Bristol Palin: Why the President's sex education policy wins |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–24 |year=2010 |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana A |last2=Miller |first2=Monica K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[George W. Bush administration]] increased federal funding for abstinence-only programs (the only type funded even under the previous [[Clinton Administration]]), while the [[Obama administration]] reversed the emphasis and provided more federal dollars for comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secondnexus.com/news/politics/donald-trump-abstinence-only-education-aoum-budget/ Trump Ignores Scientific Evidence Proving Abstinence Only Education Doesn’t Work]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] cut grants to comprehensive sex education&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-short-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-funding/ Trump administration cuts short teen pregnancy prevention program funding]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed increased funding for abstinence-only education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/trump-budget-abstinence-only-sex-ed.html Trump’s Proposed Budget Would Invest $277 Million in Abstinence-Only Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The [[Christian Right]], who initially stood against having school-based sex education programs, began supporting abstinence-only programs due to the focus on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/publius/pjr052 |jstor=41682905 |title=Saying No to Abstinence-Only Education: An Analysis of State Decision-Making |journal=Publius: the Journal of Federalism |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=613–35 |year=2012 |last1=Doan |first1=A. E |last2=McFarlane |first2=D. R }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a driving force behind the abstinence movement, they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363460711406460 |title=Battling a 'sex-saturated society': The abstinence movement and the politics of sex education |journal=Sexualities |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=416–43 |year=2011 |last1=Calterone Williams |first1=Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the New Right, the abstinence-only sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America, aligning it more with their own values, and as a result, creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage, and thus, citizens who embodied values of self-discipline and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00335630.2016.1209548 |title=Chastity for democracy: Surplus repression and the rhetoric of sex education |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=353–75 |year=2016 |last1=Kelly |first1=Casey Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence-only programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex, seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1743923X09000154 |title=Whose Responsibility? The Politics of Sex Education Policy in the United States |journal=Politics &amp; Gender |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=185–210 |year=2009 |last1=Boryczka |first1=Jocelyn }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas underlie the basis of conservative ideology, a focus on the individual having a strong place in the beliefs of this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology: Conservatism and Liberalism in Contemporary Politics|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-89899-7|location=New York, NY|pages=77–79|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it makes sense that support for abstinence-only programs as an effective form of sex education has been linked to conservative individuals.&lt;ref name=pmid25950234&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10810730.2015.1018571 |pmid=25950234 |title=The Knowledge Gap Versus the Belief Gap and Abstinence-Only Sex Education |journal=Journal of Health Communication |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=949–57 |year=2015 |last1=Hindman |first1=Douglas Blanks |last2=Yan |first2=Changmin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and pre-marital sex, some of which are covered by:

*[[Religion and birth control]]
*[[Christian views on contraception]]
*[[Protestant views on birth control]]
*[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]
*[[Sexuality and Mormonism]]
*[[Fornication]]
*[[Fornication#Islam|Premarital sex in Islam]]

The philosophical [[sex-positive movement]] cuts across many religions, and rejects the idea that consensual pre-marital sex or contraception are immoral.

'''Anthropogenic biomes''', also known as '''anthromes''' or '''human biomes''', describe the terrestrial [[biosphere]] in its contemporary, human-altered form using global ecosystem units defined by global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems. Anthromes were first named and mapped by [[Erle Ellis]] and [[Navin Ramankutty]] in their 2008 paper, "Putting People in the Map: Anthropogenic Biomes of the World".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anthrome maps now appear in numerous textbooks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapin III|first1=F.

== Anthropogenic transformation of the Biosphere ==
For more than a century, the biosphere has been described in terms of global ecosystem units called [[biomes]], which are vegetation types like [[tropical rainforests]] and [[grasslands]] that are identified in relation to global [[climate]] patterns. Considering that human populations and their use of land have fundamentally altered global patterns of ecosystem form, process, and biodiversity, anthropogenic biomes provide a framework for integrating human systems with the biosphere in the [[Anthropocene]].

=== Before 1700 ===
Humans have been altering ecosystems since we have evolved.  Evidence suggests that our ancestors were burning land to clear it at one million years ago.  600,000 years ago, humans were using spears to kill horses and other large animals in Great Britain and China.  For the past tens of thousands of years, humans have greatly changed the plant and animal life around the globe, from what type of wildlife and plant life dominated to what type of ecosystems dominate.&lt;ref name="botkin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |chapter=Chapter 10: People Have Changed the Environment Only Since the Industrial/Scientific Age. |title=25 Myths That Are Destroying the Environment: What Many Environmentalists Believe and Why They Are Wrong |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |date=2017 |pages=95–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Native Americans; they altered the forest, burnt land to clear it, settled in cities, disrupting forests and other ecosystems, and built monuments that required moving large amounts of earth, such as the Cahokia Monuments. &lt;ref name="botkin" /&gt; More examples are the civilizations of the ancient world; they mined large amounts of material, made roads, and especially for the Romans, when mining lead, released large amounts of Mercury and lead into the air.  They also moved large numbers of animals for entertainment, disrupting wildlife patterns.

=== Agriculture (1700–present) ===
Humans have been altering ecosystems since before [[agriculture]] first developed, and as the human population has grown and become more technologically advanced over time, the land use for agricultural purposes has increased significantly. The anthropogenic biome in the 1700s, before the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], was made up of mostly wild, untouched land, with no human settlement disturbing the natural state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2011). Anthropogenic transformation of the terrestrial biosphere.''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences'', ''369''(1938), 1010-1035.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period, most of the Earth's ice-free land consisted of wildlands and natural anthromes, and it wasn't until after the industrial revolution in the 19th century that land use for agriculture and human settlements started to increase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ellis, E. C., Klein Goldewijk, K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D., &amp; Ramankutty, N. (2010). Anthropogenic transformation of the biomes, 1700 to 2000. ''Global Ecology and Biogeography'', ''19''(5), 589-606.&lt;/ref&gt;  With technology advancing and manufacturing processes becoming more efficient, the human population was beginning to thrive, and was subsequently requiring and using more natural resources.  By the year 2000, over half of the Earth's ice free land was transformed into rangelands, croplands, villages and dense settlements, which left less than half of the Earth's land untouched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Anthropogenic changes between 1700 and 1800 were far smaller than those of the following centuries, and as such the rate of change has increased over time. As a result, the 20th century had the fastest rate of anthropogenic ecosystem transformation of the past 300 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Land distribution ===
As the human population steadily increased in numbers throughout history, the use of [[natural resource]]s and land began to increase, and the distribution of land used for various agricultural and settlement purposes began to change. The use of land around the world was transformed from its natural state to land used for agriculture, settlements and pastures to sustain the population and its growing needs. The distribution of land among anthromes underwent a shift away from natural anthromes and wildlands towards human-altered anthromes we are familiar with today. Now, the most populated anthromes (dense settlements and villages) account for only a small fraction of the global ice-free land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  From the year 1700-2000, lands used for agriculture and urban settlements increased significantly, however the area occupied by rangelands increased even more rapidly, so that it became the dominant anthrome in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As a result, the biggest global land-use change as a result of the industrial revolution, was the expansion of pastures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Human population ===
Following the industrial revolution, the human population experienced a rapid increase. The human [[population density]] in certain anthromes began to change, shifting away from rural environments to urban settlements, where the population density was much higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These changes in population density between areas shifted global patterns of anthrome emergence, and also had wide-spread effects on various ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Half of the Earth's population now lives in cities, and most people reside in urban anthromes, with some populations dwelling in smaller cities and towns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Currently, human populations are expected to grow until at least midcentury,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  and the transformation of the Earth's anthromes are expected to follow this growth.

=== Current state of the anthropogenic biosphere ===
The present state of the terrestrial biosphere is predominantly anthropogenic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More than half of the terrestrial biosphere remains unused directly for agriculture or urban settlements, and of these unused lands still remaining, less than half are wildlands. Most of Earth's unused lands are now within the agricultural and settled landscapes of semi-natural, rangeland, cropland and village anthromes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Major anthromes ===
Anthromes include dense settlements (urban and mixed settlements), villages, croplands, rangelands and semi-natural lands and have been mapped globally using two different classification systems, viewable on [[Google Maps]] and [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;http://ecotope.org/anthromes/maps/&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 18 anthropogenic biomes, the most prominent of which are listed below.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Alessa, L., &amp; Chapin, F. S. (2008). Anthropogenic biomes: a key contribution to earth-system science. ''Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution'', ''23''(10), 529-531.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dense settlements ====
Dense Settlements are the second most densely populated regions in the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They are defined as areas with a high population density, though the density can be variable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Population density, however, never falls below 100 persons/km, even in the non-urban parts of the dense settlements, and it has been suggested that these areas consist of both the edges of major cities in underdeveloped nations, and the long standing small towns throughout [[western Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most often we think of dense settlements as cities, but dense settlements can also be suburbs, towns and rural settlements with high but [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]] populations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2013). Sustaining biodiversity and people in the world's anthropogenic biomes. ''Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability'', ''5''(3), 368-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Croplands ====
Croplands are another major anthrome throughout the world. Croplands include most of the [[Agriculture|cultivated]] lands of the world, and also about a quarter of global tree cover.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Croplands which are locally [[Irrigation|irrigated]] have the highest human population density,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; likely due to the fact that it provides crops with a constant supply on water. This makes harvest time and crop survival more predictable. Croplands that are sustained mainly from the local rainfall are the most extensive of the populated anthromes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; with annual precipitation near 1000&amp;nbsp;mm in certain areas of the globe. In these areas, there is sufficient water supplied by the climate to support all aspects of life without hardly any irrigation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, in dryer areas, this method of agriculture would not be as productive.

==== Rangelands ====
Rangelands are a very broad anthropogenic biome group that has been described according to three levels of population density: residential, populated and remote. The Residential rangeland anthrome has two key features: its population density is never below 10 persons per square kilometre, and a substantial portion of its area is used for pasture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Pastures in rangelands are the most dominant land cover. Bare earth is significant in this anthrome, covering nearly one third of the land for every one square kilometer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rangeland anthromes are less altered than croplands, but their alteration tends to increase with population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Domestication|Domesticated]] grazing livestock are typically adapted to [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, so the alteration of these biomes tends to be less noticeable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Forests ====
Forested anthromes are dominated by tree cover, and they have high precipitation and minimal human populations, where the population density is usually less than 3 persons/km².&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most populated forests act as [[carbon sink]]s because of the lack of human activity. Without harmful emissions being released in the forests due to human activity, the vegetation is able to utilize carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and act as a sink. Remote forests are a little different than populated forests because the majority of the vegetation in these forests have been clear-cut for human consumption.  Forests are generally cleared to sustain substantial populations of domestic livestock,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to utilize the lumber.

==== Indoor ====
Very few biologists have studied the evolutionary processes at work in indoor environments.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Estimates of the extent of [[Residential area|residential]] and [[commercial district|commercial]] buildings range between 1.3% and 6% of global ice-free land area. This area is just as extensive as other small biomes such as flooded grass-lands and tropical [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forests.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The indoor biome is rapidly expanding, while forest anthromes are shrinking. The indoor biome of [[Manhattan]] is almost three times as large, in terms of its floor space, as is the geographical area of the island itself,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; due to the buildings rising up instead of spreading out. Thousands of species live in the indoor biome, many of them preferentially or even obligatorily. The only action that humans take to alter the evolution of the indoor biome is with cleaning practices. The field of indoor biomes will continue to change as long as our culture will change.

=== Implications of an anthropogenic biosphere ===
Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=E. C. |last2=Ramankutty |first2=N. |date=2008 |title=Putting people in the map: anthropogenic biomes of the world |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=439–447 |doi=10.1890/070062}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to explain or predict ecological patterns or processes across the Earth without considering the human role.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2015). Ecology in an Anthropogenic Biosphere. ''Ecological Monographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Human societies began transforming terrestrial ecology more than 50 000 years ago,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and [[evolution]]ary evidence has been presented demonstrating that the ultimate causes of human transformation of the biosphere are social and cultural, not biological, chemical, or physical.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward by acknowledging human influence on global ecosystems and moving us toward models and investigations of the terrestrial biosphere that integrate human and ecological systems.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Challenges facing biodiversity in the anthropogenic biosphere ===
==== Extinctions ====
Over the past century, anthrome extent and land use intensity increased rapidly together with growing human populations, leaving wildlands without human population or land use in less than one quarter of the terrestrial biosphere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This massive transformation of Earth's ecosystems for human use has occurred with enhanced rates of species [[extinction]]s. Humans are directly causing species extinctions, especially of [[megafauna]], by reducing, fragmenting and transforming native habitats and by overexploiting individual species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Current rates of extinctions vary greatly by taxa, with mammals, reptiles and amphibians especially threatened; however there is growing evidence that viable populations of many, if not most native taxa, especially plants, may be sustainable within anthromes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the exception of especially vulnerable taxa, the majority of native species may be capable of maintaining viable populations in anthromes.

==== Conservation ====
Anthromes present an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere by characterizing the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of global ecological land cover patterns created and sustained by human population densities and land use while also incorporating their relationships with [[Life|biotic]] communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Martin, L. J., Quinn, J. E., Ellis, E. C., Shaw, M. R., Dorning, M. A., Hallett, L. M., ... &amp; Michel, N. L. (2014). Conservation opportunities across the world's anthromes. ''Diversity and distributions'', ''20''(7), 745-755.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biome]]s and [[ecoregion]]s are limited in that they reduce human influences, and an increasing number of [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] biologists have argued that biodiversity conservation must be extended to [[habitat]]s directly shaped by humans. Within anthromes, including densely populated anthromes, humans rarely use all available land. As a result, anthromes are generally mosaics of heavily used lands and less intensively used lands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Protected areas and [[biodiversity]] hotspots are not distributed equally across anthromes. Less populated anthromes contain a greater proportion of protected areas. While 23.4% of remote woodland anthrome is protected, only 2.3% of irrigated village anthrome is protected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is increasing evidence that suggests that biodiversity conservation can be effective in both densely and sparsely settled anthromes. Land sharing and land sparing are increasingly seen as conservation strategies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Art of the United Kingdom''' refers to all forms of visual art in or associated with the United Kingdom since the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and encompass [[English art]], [[Scottish art]], [[Welsh art]] and [[Irish art]], and forms part of [[Western art history]]. During the 18th century Britain began to reclaim the leading place England had played in European art during the Middle Ages, being especially strong in portraiture and [[landscape art]]. Increasing British prosperity led to a greatly increased production of both [[fine art]] and the [[decorative arts]], the latter often being exported. The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period resulted from very diverse talents, including the painters [[William Blake]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[John Constable]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. The Victorian period saw a great diversity of art, and a far larger quantity created than before. Much Victorian art is now out of critical favour, with interest concentrated on the Pre-Raphaelites and the innovative movements at the end of the 18th century.

The training of artists, which had long been neglected, began to improve in the 18th century through private and government initiatives, and greatly expanded in the 19th. Public exhibitions and the later opening of museums brought art to a wider public, especially in London. In the 19th century publicly displayed religious art once again became popular after a virtual absence since the [[Reformation]], and, as in other countries, movements such as the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the [[Glasgow School]] contended with established [[Academic art]].

The British contribution to early [[Modernist art]] was relatively small, but since World War II British artists have made a considerable impact on [[Contemporary art]], especially with figurative work, and Britain remains a key centre of an increasingly globalized art world.

==Background==
[[File:Elizabeth I Unknown Artist 1570s.jpg|thumb|200px|Unknown artist, ''[[Portrait of Elizabeth I]]'', 1570s]] 
{{Main|English art|Irish art|Scottish art|Welsh art}}
The oldest surviving British art includes [[Stonehenge]] from around 2600 BC, and [[tin]] and [[gold]] works of art produced by the [[Beaker people]] from around 2150 BC.  The [[La Tène]] style of [[Celtic art]] reached the British Isles rather late, no earlier than about 400 BC, and developed a particular "Insular Celtic" style seen in objects such as the [[Battersea Shield]], and a number of bronze mirror-backs decorated with intricate patterns of curves, spirals and trumpet-shapes.  Only in the British Isles can Celtic decorative style be seen to have survived throughout the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], as shown in objects like the [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] and the resurgence of Celtic motifs, now blended with Germanic [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and Mediterranean elements, in Christian [[Insular art]].  This had a brief but spectacular flowering in all the countries that now form the United Kingdom in the 7th and 8th centuries, in works such as the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]].  The Insular style was influential across Northern Europe, and especially so in later [[Anglo-Saxon art]], although this received new Continental influences.

The English contribution to [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]] was considerable, especially in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and monumental sculpture for churches, though the other countries were now essentially provincial, and in the 15th century Britain struggled to keep up with developments in painting on the Continent.  A few examples of top-quality English painting on walls or panel from before 1500 have survived, including the [[Westminster Retable]], [[The Wilton Diptych]] and some survivals from paintings in [[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 9–120, or see the references at the linked articles&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]]s of [[English Reformation|England]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Scotland]] were especially destructive of existing religious art, and the production of new work virtually ceased.  The [[Artists of the Tudor Court]] were mostly imported from Europe, setting a pattern that would continue until the 18th century.  The [[portraiture of Elizabeth I]] ignored contemporary European Renaissance models to create iconic images that border on [[naive art]].  The portraitists [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]] were the most distinguished and influential of a large number of artists who spent extended periods in Britain, generally eclipsing local talents like [[Nicolas Hilliard]], the painter of [[portrait miniature]]s, [[Robert Peake the elder]], [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]], [[William Dobson]], and [[John Michael Wright]], a Scot who mostly worked in London.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapters 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape painting was as yet little developed in Britain at the time of the Union, but a tradition of [[marine art]] had been established by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]] both called Willem van de Velde, who had been the leading Dutch maritime painters until they moved to London in 1673, in the middle of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 18th century==
[[File:William Hogarth 004.jpg|thumb|320px|William Hogarth, ''[[The Bench (Hogarth)|The Bench]]'', 1758]]
The so-called [[Acts of Union 1707]] came in the middle of the long period of domination in London of Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], a German portraitist who had eventually succeeded as principal court painter the Dutch Sir [[Peter Lely]], whose style he had adopted for his enormous and formulaic output, of greatly varying quality, which was itself repeated by an army of lesser painters.  His counterpart in Edinburgh, Sir [[John Baptist Medina]], born in Brussels to Spanish parents, had died just before the Union took place, and was one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created.  Medina had first worked in London, but in mid-career moved to the less competitive environment of Edinburgh, where he dominated portraiture of the Scottish elite.  However, after the Union the movement was to be all in the other direction, and Scottish aristocrats resigned themselves to paying more to have their portraits painted in London, even if by Scottish painters such as Medina's pupil [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]], who moved down in 1723, or [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 138–139; 151; 163&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an alternative, more direct, tradition in British portraiture to that of Lely and Kneller, tracing back to William Dobson and the German or Dutch [[Gerard Soest]], who trained [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], to whom only a few works are firmly attributed and who in turn trained [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]], a fine artist who trained [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]] who trained Joshua Reynolds and Joseph Wright of Derby.  Richardson also trained the most notable Irish portraitist of the period, [[Charles Jervas]] who enjoyed social and financial success in London despite his clear limitations as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 135–138; 147–150&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to the dominance of the "[[hierarchy of genres|lower genres]]" of painting was Sir [[James Thornhill]] (1675/76–1734) who was the first and last significant English painter of huge [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] allegorical decorative schemes, and the first native painter to be knighted.  His best-known work is at [[Old Royal Naval College|Greenwich Hospital]], [[Blenheim Palace]] and the [[cupola]] of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]].  His drawings show a taste for strongly drawn realism in the direction his son-in-law [[William Hogarth]] was to pursue, but this is largely overridden in the finished works, and for Greenwich he took to heart his careful list of "Objections that will arise from the plain representation of [[Glorious Revolution#Invasion|the King's landing]] as it was in fact and in the modern way and dress" and painted a conventional Baroque glorification.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 131–133. The "objections" included that it was a dark night, the boat was small, the king not smartly dressed, and many of the nobles who accompanied him were by then out of favour.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Hogarth, he played the nationalist card in promoting himself, and eventually beat [[Sebastiano Ricci]] to enough commissions that in 1716 he and his team retreated to France, [[Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini]] having already left in 1713.  Once the other leading foreign painters of allegoric schemes, [[Antonio Verrio]] and [[Louis Laguerre]], had died in 1707 and 1721 respectively, Thornhill had the field to himself, although by the end of his life commissions for grand schemes had dried up from changes in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 132–133; Pevsner, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1714 the new [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] conducted a far less ostentatious court, and largely withdrew from patronage of the arts, other than the necessary portraits.  Fortunately, the booming British economy was able to supply aristocratic and mercantile wealth to replace the court, above all in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 358-361&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Gate of Calais]]'', an anti-French satire by [[William Hogarth]], 1748]]

[[William Hogarth]] was a great presence in the second quarter of the century, whose art was successful in achieving a particular English character, with vividly moralistic scenes of contemporary life, full of both satire and pathos, attuned to the tastes and prejudices of the Protestant middle-class, who bought the [[engraving|engraved]] versions of his paintings in huge numbers. Other subjects were only issued as prints, and Hogarth was both the first significant British printmaker, and still the best known.  Many works were series of four or more scenes, of which the best known are: ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' from the 1730s and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' from the mid-1740s.  In fact, although he only once briefly left England and his own propaganda asserted his Englishness and often attacked the [[Old Master]]s, his background in [[printmaking]], more closely aware of Continental art than most British painting, and apparently his ability to quickly absorb lessons from other painters, meant that he was more aware of, and made more use of, Continental art than most of his contemporaries.

Like many later painters Hogarth wanted above all to achieve success at [[history painting]] in the [[Grand Manner]], but his few attempts were not successful and are now little regarded. His portraits were mostly of middle-class sitters shown with an apparent realism that reflected both sympathy and flattery, and included some in the fashionable form of the [[conversation piece]], recently introduced from France by [[Philippe Mercier]], which was to remain a favourite in Britain, taken up by artists such as [[Francis Hayman]], though usually abandoned once an artist could get good single figure commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 165; 168–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teekanne Courtauld.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver teapot by Samuel Courtauld, London, 1748–49]]
There was a recognition that, even more than the rest of Europe given the lack of British artists, the training of artists needed to be extended beyond the workshop of established masters, and various attempts were made to set up [[academies]], starting with Kneller in 1711, with the help of Pellegrini, in Great Queen Street.  The academy was taken over by Thornhill in 1716, but seems to have become inactive by the time [[John Vanderbank]] and [[Louis Chéron]] set up their own academy in 1720.  This did not last long, and in 1724/5 Thornhill tried again in his own house, with little success. Hogarth inherited the equipment for this, and used it to start the [[St. Martin's Lane Academy]] in 1735, which was the most enduring, eventually being absorbed by the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.  Hogarth also helped solve the problem of a lack of exhibition venues in London, arranging for shows at the [[Foundling Hospital]] from 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish portraitist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] worked in Edinburgh before moving to London by 1739.  He made visits of three years to Italy at the beginning and end of his career, and anticipated [[Joshua Reynolds]] in bringing a more relaxed version of "Grand Manner" to British portraiture, combined with very sensitive handling in his best work, which is generally agreed to have been of female sitters.  His main London rival in the mid-century, until Reynolds made his reputation, was Reynold's master, the stodgy [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wootton]], active from about 1714 to his death in 1765, was the leading sporting painter of his day, based in the capital of English [[horse racing]] at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also battle scenes and conversation pieces with a [[fox hunting|hunting]] or riding setting.  He had begun life as a page to the family of the [[Dukes of Beaufort]], who in the 1720s sent him to Rome, where he acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of [[Gaspard Dughet]] and [[Claude Lorraine|Claude]], which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects.  This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as [[George Lambert (English painter)|George Lambert]], the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]] was the best of the native marine and townscape artists, though in the latter specialization he could not match the visiting [[Canaletto]], who was in England from nine years from 1746, and whose Venetian views were a favourite souvenir of the [[Grand Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 153–154, 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[antiquary]] and engraver [[George Vertue]] was a figure in the London art scene for most of the period, and his copious notebooks were adapted and published in the 1760s by [[Horace Walpole]] as ''Some Anecdotes of Painting in England'', which remains a principal source for the period.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

From his arrival in London in 1720, the Flemish sculptor [[John Michael Rysbrack]] was the leader in his field until the arrival in 1730 of [[Louis-François Roubiliac]] who had a [[Rococo]] style which was highly effective in busts and small figures, though by the following decade he was also commissioned for larger works.  He also produced models for the [[Chelsea porcelain factory]] founded in 1743, a private enterprise which sought to compete with Continental factories mostly established by rulers. Roubiliac's style formed that of the leading native sculptor [[Sir Henry Cheere, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Cheere]], and his [[John Cheere|brother John]] who specialized in statues for gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Snowdin, 278-287, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong London [[silversmithing]] trade was dominated by the descendants of [[Huguenot]] refugees like [[Paul de Lamerie]], [[Paul Crespin]], [[Nicholas Sprimont]], and the [[Louisa Courtauld|Courtauld family]], as well as [[Georges Wickes]].  Orders were received from as far away as the courts of Russia and Portugal, though English styles were still led by Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 100–106&lt;/ref&gt;  The manufacture of [[silk]] at [[Spitalfields]] in London was also a traditional Huguenot business, but from the late 1720s silk design was dominated by the surprising figure of [[Anna Maria Garthwaite]], a parson's daughter from [[Lincolnshire]] who emerged at the age of 40 as a designer of largely floral patterns in Rococo styles.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in France and Germany, the English adoption of the Rococo style was patchy rather than whole-hearted, and there was resistance to it on nationalist grounds, led by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] and [[William Kent]], who promoted styles in interior design and furniture to match the [[Palladianism]] of the architecture they produced together, also beginning the influential British tradition of the [[landscape garden]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), Chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] "the most influential of all English innovations in art".&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  The French-born engraver [[Hubert-François Gravelot]], in London from 1732 to 1745, was a key figure in importing Rococo taste in book illustrations and ornament prints for craftsmen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 15–17; 29–31 and throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern popular mind, English art from about 1750–1790 — today referred to as the "classical age" of English painting — was dominated by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1723–1792), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] (1727–1788) and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1734–1797).   At the time Reynolds was considered the dominant figure, Gainsborough was very highly reputed, but Stubbs was seen as a mere painter of animals and viewed as far a less significant figure than many other painters that are today little-known or forgotten. The period saw continued rising prosperity for Britain and British artists: "By the 1780s English painters were among the wealthiest men in the country, their names familiar to newspaper readers, their quarrels and cabals the talk of the town, their subjects known to everyone from the displays in the print-shop windows", according to [[Gerald Reitlinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 58 (quote), 59-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds returned from a long visit to Italy in 1753, and very quickly established a reputation as the most fashionable London portraitist, and before long as a formidable figure in society;, the public leader of the arts in Britain. He had studied both classical and modern Italian art, and his compositions discreetly re-use models seen on his travels. He could convey a wide range of moods and emotions, whether heroic military men or very young women, and often to unite background and figure in a dramatic way.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 217-230&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]], ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'', 1768]]
The [[Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] had been founded in 1754, principally to provide a location for exhibitions. In 1761 Reynolds was a leader in founding the rival [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], where the artists had more control.  This continued until 1791, despite the founding of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768, which immediately became both the most important exhibiting organization and the most important school in London.  Reynolds was its first President, holding the office until his death in 1792.  His published ''Discourses'', first delivered to the students, were regarded as the first major writing on art in English, and set out the aspiration for a style to match the classical grandeur of classical sculpture and [[High Renaissance]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165, 225–227, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Academy was established, Reynolds' portraits became more overly classicizing, and often more distant, until in the late 1770s he returned to a more intimate style, perhaps influenced by the success of [[Thomas Gainsborough]],&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 227-230&lt;/ref&gt; who only settled in London in 1773, after working in [[Ipswich]] and then [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].  While Reynolds' practice of aristocratic portraits seem exactly matched to his talents, Gainsborough, if not forced to follow the market for his work, might well have developed as a pure landscape painter, or a portraitist in the informal style of many of his portraits of his family.  He continued to paint pure landscapes for, largely for pleasure until his later years; full recognition of his landscapes came only in the 20th century. His main influences were French in his portraits and Dutch in his landscapes, rather than Italian, and he is famous for the brilliant light touch of his brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapter 18; Piper, 54-56; Mellon, 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] also became prominent in about 1770 and was active until 1799, though with a falling-off in his last years.  His portraits are mostly characterful but flattering images of dignified society figures, but he developed an obsession with the flighty young [[Emma Hamilton]] from 1781, painting her about sixty times in more extravagant poses.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 306-311&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was especially sought-after by American collectors in the early 20th century and many are now in American museums.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84; Reitlinger, 434-437 with the remarkable numbers&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the period this generation had been succeeded by younger portraitists including [[John Hoppner]], [[Sir William Beechey]] and the young [[Gilbert Stuart]], who only realized his mature style after he returned to America.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh painter [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] returned to London from seven years in Italy in 1757, and over the next two decades developed a "sublime" landscape style adapting the Franco-Italian tradition of Claude and Gaspard Dughet to British subjects.  Though much admired, like those of Gainsborough his landscapes were hard to sell, and he sometimes resorted, as Reynolds complained, to the common strategem of turning them into [[history painting]]s by adding a few small figures, which doubled their price to about £80.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75; Waterhouse, 232-241&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to paint scenes set in Italy, as well as England and Wales, and his death in 1782 came just as large numbers of artists began to travel to Wales, and later the [[Lake District]] and Scotland in search of mountainous views, both for oil paintings and [[watercolour]]s which were now starting their long period of popularity in Britain, both with professionals and amateurs. [[Paul Sandby]], [[Francis Towne]], [[John Warwick Smith]], and [[John Robert Cozens]] were among the leading specialist painters and the clergyman and amateur artist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] was an important writer who stimulated the popularity of amateur painting of the [[picturesque]], while the works of [[Alexander Cozens]] recommended forming random ink blots into landscape compositions—even Constable tried this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|[[John Singleton Copley]], ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778)]]
[[History painting]] in the grand manner continued to be the most prestigious form of art, though not the easiest to sell, and Reynolds made several attempts at it, as unsuccessful as Hogarth's.  The unheroic nature of modern dress was seen as a major obstacle in the depiction of contemporary scenes, and the Scottish gentleman-artist and art dealer [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] preferred classical scenes as well as painting some based on his Eastern travels, where his European figures by-passed the problem by wearing Arab dress.  He spent most of his adult life based in Rome and had at least as much influence on [[Neo-Classicism]] in Europe as in Britain.  The Irishman [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] was an influence on Blake but had a difficult career, and spent years on his cycle ''The Progress of Human Culture'' in the Great Room of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  The most successful history painters, who were not afraid of buttons and wigs, were both Americans settled in London: [[Benjamin West]] and [[John Singleton Copley]], though one of his most successful works ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) was able to mostly avoid them, showing a rescue from drowning.  Smaller scale subjects from literature were also popular, pioneered by [[Francis Hayman]], one of the first to paint scenes from [[Shakespeare]], and [[Joseph Highmore]], with a series illustrating the novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''.  At the end of the period the [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]] was an ambitious project for paintings, and prints after them, illustrating "the Bard", as he had now become, and exposing the limitations of contemporary English history painting.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 478-479; Waterhouse, Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] was mainly a portrait painter who also was one of the first artists to depict the [[Industrial Revolution]], as well as developing a cross between the conversation piece and history painting in works like ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) and ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' (c. 1766), which like many of his works are lit only by candlelight, giving a strong [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 332-342; Waterhouse, 285-289&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Blake - Nebuchadnezzar (Tate Britain).jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[William Blake]], ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'', after 1795]]
Paintings recording scenes from the theatre were another subgenre, painted by the German [[Johann Zoffany]] among others. Zoffany painted portraits and conversation pieces, who also spent over two years in India, painting the English [[Nawab#Nabob|nabobs]] and local scenes, and the expanding [[British Empire]] played an increasing role in British art.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 315-322&lt;/ref&gt;  Training in art was considered a useful skill in the military for sketch maps and plans, and many British officers made the first Western images, often in watercolour, of scenes and places around the world.  In India, the [[Company style]] developed as a hybrid form between Western and [[Indian art]], produced by Indians for a British market.

[[Thomas Rowlandson]] produced watercolours and prints satirizing British life, but mostly avoided politics. The master of the political [[caricature]], sold individually by print shops (often acting as publishers also), either hand-coloured or plain, was [[James Gillray]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on portrait-painting in British art was not entirely due to the vanity of the sitters. There was a large collector's market for portrait prints, mostly reproductions of paintings, which were often mounted in albums. From the mid-century there was a great growth in the expensive but more effective reproductions in [[mezzotint]], of portraits and other paintings, with special demand from collectors for early proof states "before letter" (that is, before the inscriptions were added), which the printmakers obligingly printed off in growing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 49, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

This period marked one of the high points in British decorative arts. Around the mid-century many [[porcelain]] factories opened, including [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]] in London, and in the provinces [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]], [[Royal Worcester|Worcester]], [[Royal Crown Derby]], [[Liverpool porcelain|Liverpool]], and [[Wedgwood]], with [[Spode]] following in 1767. Most were started as small concerns, with some lasting only a few decades while others still survive today.  By the end of the period British porcelain services were being commissioned by foreign royalty and the British manufacturers were especially adept at pursuing the rapidly expanding international middle-class market, developing [[bone china]] and [[transfer-print]]ed wares as well as hand-painted true porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;snowdin, 236–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The three leading furniture makers, [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1718–1779), [[Thomas Sheraton]] (1751–1806) and [[George Hepplewhite]] (1727?–1786) had varied styles and have achieved the lasting fame they have mainly as the authors of pattern books used by other makers in Britain and abroad.  In fact it is far from clear if the last two named ever ran actual workshops, though Chippendale certainly was successful in this and in what we now call interior design; unlike France Britain had abandoned its [[guild]] system, and Chippendale was able to employ specialists in all the crafts needed to complete a redecoration.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 154–157&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period Rococo and [[Chinoiserie]] gave way to [[Neo-Classicism]], with the Scottish architect and interior designer [[Robert Adam]] (1728–1792) leading the new style.

==19th century and the Romantics==
[[File:Samuel_Palmer_-_Self-Portrait_-_WGA16951.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Samuel Palmer]], ''Self-portrait, c. 1826]]
The late 18th century and the early 19th century characterized by the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in British art includes [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], [[James Ward (artist)|James Ward]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and was perhaps the most radical period in British art, also producing [[William Blake]] (1757–1827), [[John Constable]] (1776–1837) and [[J.M.W. Turner]] (1775–1851), the later two being arguably the most internationally influential of all British artists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6214553/JMW-Turners-feud-with-John-Constable-unveiled-at-Tate-Britain.html Stephen Adams, The Telegraph, September 22, 2009, ''JMW Turner's feud with John Constable unveiled at Tate Britain''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6843533.ece Jack Malvern, The Sunday Times, September 22, 2009, ''Tate Britain exhibition revives Turner and Constable’s old rivalry''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's style, based on the Italianate tradition although he never saw Italy until in his forties, passed through considerable changes before his final wild, almost abstract, landscapes that explored the effects of light, and were a profound influence on the [[Impressionists]] and other later movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turner/gallery3d.htm Tate Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Constable normally painted pure landscapes with at most a few genre figures, in a style based on Northern European traditions, but, like Turner, his "six-footers" were intended to make as striking an impact as any history painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/constableinfo.shtm ''Constable's Great Landscapes: The Six-Foot Paintings,'' National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were carefully prepared using studies and full-size [[oil sketch]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 161–164; Mellon, 134; [http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate 2006 Constable exhibition] Tate Britain feature.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Turner was notorious for finishing his exhibition pieces when they were already hanging for show, freely adjusting them to dominate the surrounding works in the tightly-packed hangs of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's visionary style was a minority taste in his lifetime, but influenced the younger group of "[[Ancients (art group)|Ancients]]" of Samuel Palmer, [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]] and [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], who gathered in the country at [[Shoreham, Kent]] in the 1820s, producing intense and lyrical pastoral idylls in conditions of some poverty.  They went on to more conventional artistic careers and Palmer's early work was entirely forgotten until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; Blake and Palmer became a significant influence on modernist artists of the 20th century seen (among others) in the painting of British artists such as [[Dora Carrington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BCduKb-ujO8C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=dora+carrington+and+blake&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zRujez6ton&amp;sig=5KCIez-7s2JfE4aPdpmj2vihl3U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bu3_TMzQNoGdlgfi2aHNCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dora%20carrington%20and%20blake&amp;f=false Dictionary of women artists] Retrieved 8 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker.

[[Thomas Lawrence]] was already a leading portraitist by the start of the 20th century, and able to give a Romantic dash to his portraits of high society, and the leaders of Europe gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Henry Raeburn]] was the most significant portraitist since the Union to remain based in Edinburgh throughout his career, an indication of increasing Scottish prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 96-98; Waterhouse, 330&lt;/ref&gt;  But [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] took the traditional road south, achieving great success with subjects of country life and hybrid [[genre painting|genre]] and history scenes such as ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Flaxman]] was the most thorough-going neo-classical English artist. Beginning as a sculptor, he became best known for his many spare "outline drawings" of classical scenes, often illustrating literature, which were reproduced as prints.  These imitated the effects of the classical-style reliefs he also produced.  The German-Swiss [[Henry Fuseli]] also produced work in a linear graphic style, but his narrative scenes, often from English literature, were intensely Romantic and highly dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian art==
{{main|Victorian painting}}
[[File:Millais - Überfahrt nach Nordwest.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Everett Millais]], ''[[The North-West Passage]]'' (1878)]]

The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] (PRB) achieved considerable influence after its foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and [[genre]] subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style, rejecting the loose painterly brushwork of the tradition represented by "Sir Sloshua" Reynolds.  PRB artists included [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Ford Madox Brown]] (never officially a member), and figures such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[John William Waterhouse]] were later much influenced by aspects of their ideas, as was the designer [[William Morris]]. Morris advocated a return to hand-craftsmanship in the decorative arts over the industrial manufacture that was rapidly being applied to all crafts. His efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs defining the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] aesthetic and instigating the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].

The Pre-Raphaelites, like Turner, were supported by the authoritative art critic [[John Ruskin]], himself a fine amateur artist. For all their technical innovation, they were both traditional and Victorian in their adherence to the [[history painting]] as the [[Hierarchy of genres|highest form of art]], and their subject matter was thoroughly in tune with Victorian taste, and indeed "everything that the publishers of steel engravings welcomed",&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 97&lt;/ref&gt; enabling them to merge easily into the mainstream in their later careers.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 139–146; Wilson, 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leighton of Stretton, Frederick Leighton, Baron - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Lord Leighton]], 1855, ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's celebrated Madonna is carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'', 222 × 521 cm]]

While the Pre-Raphaelites had a turbulent and divided reception, the most popular and expensive painters of the period included [[Edwin Landseer]], who specialized in sentimental animal subjects, which were favourites of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. In the later part of the century artists could earn large sums from selling the reproduction rights of their paintings to print publishers, and works of Landseer, especially his ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1851), a portrait of a Highland stag, were among the most popular. Like Millais' ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' (1886) it was used on packaging and advertisements for decades, for brands of whisky and soap respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 149; Strong (1999), 540–541; Reitlinger, 97–99, 148–151 and elsewhere; he has detail throughout on reproduction rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late Victorian era in Britain the academic paintings, some enormously large, of [[Lord Leighton]] and the Dutch-born [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were enormously popular, both often featuring lightly clad beauties in exotic or classical settings, while the allegorical works of [[George Frederic Watts|G.F. Watts]] matched the Victorian sense of high purpose.  The classical ladies of [[Edward Poynter]] and [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] wore more clothes and met with rather less success.

[[William Powell Frith]] painted highly detailed scenes of social life, typically including all classes of society, that include comic and moral elements and have an acknowledged debt to Hogarth, though tellingly different from his work.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 85; Bills, Mark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8IPhEUcc3YC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Frith and the Influence of Hogarth''], in ''William Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age'', by Mark Bills &amp; [[Vivien Knight]], Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-12190-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all such artists the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] was an essential platform, reviewed at huge length in the press, which often alternated ridicule and extravagant praise in discussing works.  The ultimate, and very rare, accolade was when a rail had to be put in front of a painting to protect it from the eager crowd; up to 1874 this had only happened to Wilkie's ''[[Chelsea Pensioners]]'', Frith's ''[[The Derby Day]]'' and ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' and Luke Filde's ''[[The Casual Ward]]'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 157; Wilson, 85; Frith's ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' (1871), now [[Providence, Rhode Island]], is Frith's last great panorama, of the gambling at [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Homburg]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcnf5aTOkyEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;l].&lt;/ref&gt;  A great number of artists laboured year after year in the hope of a hit there, often working in manners to which their talent was not really suited, a trope exemplified by the suicide in 1846 of [[Benjamin Haydon]], a friend of [[Keats]] and [[Dickens]] and a better writer than painter, leaving his blood splashed over his unfinished ''King Alfred and the First British Jury''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

British history was a very common subject, with the Middle Ages, Elizabeth I, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and the [[English Civil War]] especially popular sources for subjects.  Many painters mentioned elsewhere painted historical subjects, including Millais (''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' and many others), Ford Madox Brown (''[[Cromwell on his Farm]]''), David Wilkie, Watts and Frith, and West, Bonington and Turner in earlier decades.  The London-based Irishman [[Daniel Maclise]] and [[Charles West Cope]] painted scenes for the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. [[Lady Jane Grey]] was, like Mary Queen of Scots, a female whose sufferings attracted many painters, though none quite matched ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', one of many British historical subjects by the Frenchman [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), throughout. See Appendix I for a revealing full listing of pictures shown at the RA 1769–1904, analysed by subject&lt;/ref&gt;  Painters prided themselves on the increasing accuracy of their period settings in terms of costume and objects, studying the collections of the new [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and books, and scorning the breezy approximations of earlier generations of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), 47-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Redgrave - The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home.JPG|thumb|[[Richard Redgrave]], ''The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home'', 1858]]
Victorian painting developed the Hogarthian social subject, packed with moralizing detail, and the tradition of illustrating scenes from literature, into a range of types of genre painting, many with only a few figures, others large and crowded scenes like Frith's best-known works.  Holman Hunt's ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' (1853) and [[Augustus Egg]]'s set of ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'' (1858) are of the first type, both dealing with "fallen women", a perennial Victorian concern.  As [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]] points out, these were paintings designed to be read like novels, whose meaning emerged after the viewer had done the work of deciphering it.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Peter. ''The Victorian Treasure House''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other "anecdotal" scenes were lighter in mood, tending towards being captionless ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons.

Towards the end of the 19th century the [[problem picture]] left the details of the narrative action deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to speculate on it using the evidence in front of them, but not supplying a final answer (artists learned to smile enigmatically when asked).  This sometimes provoked discussion on sensitive social issues, typically involving women, that might have been hard to raise directly.  They were enormously popular; newspapers ran competitions for readers to supply the meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Orientalism]], though not as common as in France at the same period, had many specialists, including [[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for nine years in [[Cairo]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], a Scot who made lithographs of his travels in the Middle East and Italy, the nonsense writer [[Edward Lear]], a continual traveller who reached as far as [[Ceylon]], and [[Richard Dadd]]. Holman Hunt also travelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to obtain authentic settings for his Biblical pictures.  The Frenchman [[James Tissot]], who fled to London after the fall of the [[Paris Commune]], divided his time between scenes of high society social events and a huge series of Biblical illustrations, made in watercolour for reproductive publication.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 148–151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Goodall]] specialized in scenes of Ancient Egypt.

[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'' (1874). A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."

Larger paintings concerned with the social conditions of the poor tended to concentrate on rural scenes, so that the misery of the human figures was at least offset by a landscape.  Painters of these included [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Luke Fildes]] (although he made his name in 1874 with ''[[Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward]]''- see above), [[Frank Holl]], [[George Clausen]], and the German [[Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 89-91; Rosenthal, 144, 160–162; Reitlinger, 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bell Scott]], a friend of the Rossettis, painted historical scenes and other types of work, but was also one of the few artists to depict scenes from heavy industry. His memoirs are a useful source for the period, and he was one of several artists to be employed for a period in the greatly expanded system of government art schools, which were driven by the administrator [[Henry Cole]] (the inventor of the [[Christmas card]]) and employed [[Richard Redgrave]], [[Edward Poynter]], [[Richard Burchett]], the Scottish designer [[Christopher Dresser]] and many others.  Burchett was headmaster of the "South Kensington Schools", now the [[Royal College of Art]], which gradually replaced the Royal Academy School as the leading British art school, though around the start of the 20th century the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] produced many of the forward-looking artists.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, 12-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy was initially by no means as conservative and restrictive as the [[Paris Salon]], and the Pre-Raphaelites had most of their submissions for exhibition accepted, although like everyone else they complained about the positions their paintings were given.  They were especially welcomed at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]], one of the largest regional exhibiting organizations; the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] was founded in 1826 and opened its [[Royal Scottish Academy Building|grand new building]] in the 1850s.  There were alternative London locations like the [[British Institution]], and as the conservatism of the Royal Academy gradually increased, despite the efforts of [[Lord Leighton]] when President, new spaces opened, notably the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in [[Bond Street]], from 1877, which became the home of the Aesthetic Movement. The [[New English Art Club]] exhibited from 1885 many artists with Impressionist tendencies, initially using the [[Egyptian Hall]], opposite the Royal Academy, which also hosted many exhibitions of foreign art. The American portrait painter [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856–1925), spent most of his working career in Europe and he maintained his studio in London (where he died) from 1886 to 1907.

[[Alfred Sisley]], who was French by birth but had British nationality, painted in France as one of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]; [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] at the start of their careers were also strongly influenced, but despite the dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] bringing many exhibitions to London, the movement made little impact in England until decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 57-62; Wilson, 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;  Some members of the [[Newlyn School]] of landscapes and genre scenes adopted a quasi-Impressionist technique while others used realist or more traditional levels of finish.

The late 19th century also saw the [[Decadent movement]] in France and the British [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic movement]]. The British-based American painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]], and the former [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are associated with those movements, with late Burne-Jones and Beardsley both being admired abroad and representing the nearest British approach to European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 James McNeill Whistler, sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref name="blogs.princeton.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; The jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler but awarded him only a single farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Lisa N., ''James McNeil Whistler'', pp. 51-52, {{ISBN|1-880908-70-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence ("The White House" in [[Tite Street]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], designed with [[Edward William Godwin|E. W. Godwin]], 1877–8), bankrupted Whistler by May 1879,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's See The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112539/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's |date=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stansky's review of Linda Merill's ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin'' in the ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 24, No. 3  (Winter, 1994), pp. 536-537 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206692]&lt;/ref&gt; notes the irony that the [[Fine Art Society|Fine Art Society of London]], which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's legal costs, supported him in etching [[The Stones of Venice (book)|"the stones of Venice"]] (and in exhibiting the series in 1883) which helped recoup Whistler's costs.

Scottish art was now regaining an adequate home market, allowing it to develop a distinctive character, of which the "[[Glasgow Boys]]" were one expression, straddling [[Impressionism]] in painting, and [[Art Nouveau]], [[Japonism]] and the [[Celtic Revival]] in design, with the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] now their best-known member.  Painters included [[Thomas Millie Dow]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]], [[Joseph Crawhall III|Joseph Crawhall]] and [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]].

New printing technology brought a great expansion in book illustration with illustrations for [[children's books]] providing much of the best remembered work of the period. Specialized artists included [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and, from 1902, [[Beatrix Potter]].

The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the [[British Empire]], led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="taste"/&gt; [[British people]] used their art "to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world", whilst the permanent settlers in [[British North America]], [[Australasia]], and South Africa "embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity".&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/art/artandempire.htm|title=Art and Empire|publisher=britishempire.co.uk|accessdate=24 October 2008|last=McKenzie|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire has been "at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art".&lt;ref name="empire3"&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous variety and massive production of the various forms of British decorative art during the period are too complex to be easily summarized.  Victorian taste, until the various movements of the last decades, such as [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]], is generally poorly regarded today, but much fine work was produced, and much money made.  Both [[William Burges]] and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]] were architects committed to the [[Gothic Revival]], who expanded into designing furniture, metalwork, tiles and objects in other media. There was an enormous boom in re-Gothicising the fittings of medieval churches, and fitting out new ones in the style, especially with [[stained glass]], an [[British and Irish stained glass (1811–1918)|industry revived from effective extinction]].  The revival of furniture painted with images was a particular feature at the top end of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style07a/index.html Gothic Revival] Feature from the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From its opening in 1875 the London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]] was especially associated with imported Far Eastern decorative items and British goods in the new styles of the end of the 19th century. [[Charles Voysey (architect)|Charles Voysey]] was an architect who also did much design work in textiles, wallpaper furniture and other media, bringing the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] into [[Art Nouveau]] and beyond; he continued to design into the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O73429/wallpaper-print-the-saladin/.html Voysey wallpaper]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, V&amp;A Museum&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. H. Mackmurdo]] was a similar figure.

[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|[[Graham Sutherland]], ''The City a fallen lift shaft'' (1941)]]
In many respects, the Victorian era continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the Royal Academy became increasingly ossified; the unmistakably late Victorian figure of [[Frank Dicksee]] was appointed President in 1924. In photography [[Pictorialism]] aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; [[The Linked Ring]] contained the leading practitioners.  The American [[John Singer Sargent]] was the most successful London portraitist at the start of the 20th century, with [[John Lavery]], [[Augustus John]] and [[William Orpen]] rising figures.  John's sister [[Gwen John]] lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death.  British attitudes to [[modern art]] were "polarized" at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittle et al|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernist]] movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; [[Impressionism]] was initially regarded by "many conservative critics" as a "subversive foreign influence", but became "fully assimilated" into British art during the early-20th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"/&gt; The Irish artist [[Jack Butler Yeats]] (1871–1957), was based in Dublin, at once a [[Romanticism|romantic painter]], a [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist]] and an [[Expressionism|expressionist]].

[[Vorticism]] was a brief coming together of a number of [[Modernist]] artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included [[Wyndham Lewis]], the sculptor [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Malcolm Arbuthnot]], [[Lawrence Atkinson]], the American photographer [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Etchells]], the French sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Cuthbert Hamilton]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]], [[Edward Wadsworth]], [[Jessica Dismorr]], [[Helen Saunders]], and [[Dorothy Shakespear]]. The early 20th century also includes [[The Sitwells]] artistic circle and the [[Bloomsbury Group]], a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter [[Dora Carrington]], painter and [[art critic]] [[Roger Fry]], [[art critic]] [[Clive Bell]], painter [[Vanessa Bell]], painter [[Duncan Grant]] among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 127–129; Mellon, 182–186&lt;/ref&gt; British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as [[Ben Nicholson]] kept in touch with European developments.

[[Walter Sickert]] and the [[Camden Town Group]] developed an English style of Impressionism and [[Post-Impressionism]] with a strong strand of social documentary, including [[Harold Gilman]], [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Frederick Gore]], [[Charles Ginner]], [[Robert Bevan]], [[Malcolm Drummond]] and [[Lucien Pissarro]] (the son of French Impressionist painter [[Camille Pissarro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=59 Camden Town Group, Tate] Retrieved 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where their colouring is often notoriously drab, the [[Scottish Colourists]] indeed mostly used bright light and colour; some, like [[Samuel Peploe]] and [[John Duncan Fergusson]], were living in France to find suitable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=265 Scottish Colourists, Tate] Retrieved 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially inspired by Sir [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910), a Scottish landscape painter associated with Impressionism.
 
The reaction to the horrors of the First World War prompted a return to pastoral subjects as represented by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Eric Ravilious]], mainly a printmaker. [[Stanley Spencer]] painted mystical works, as well as landscapes, and the sculptor, printmaker and [[typographer]] [[Eric Gill]] produced elegant simple forms in a style related to [[Art Deco]]. The [[Euston Road School]] was a group of "progressive" realists of the late 1930s, including the influential teacher [[William Coldstream]]. [[Surrealism]], with artists including [[John Tunnard]] and the [[Birmingham Surrealists]], was briefly popular in the 1930s, influencing [[Roland Penrose]] and [[Henry Moore]]. [[Stanley William Hayter]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaking|printmaker]] associated in the 1930s with [[Surrealism]] and from 1940 onward with [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley William Hayter (1901 − 1989) |url=http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |work=Art Collection |publisher=British Council |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715104006/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 Hayter founded the legendary ''Atelier 17'' studio in Paris.  Since his death in 1988, it has been known as ''Atelier Contrepoint.'' Hayter became one of the most influential printmakers of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brenson | first = Michael | title = Stanley William Hayter, 86, Dies; Painter Taught Miró and Pollock | work=The New York Times |date=6 May 1988 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/06/obituaries/stanley-william-hayter-86-dies-painter-taught-miro-and-pollack.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashionable portraitists included [[Meredith Frampton]] in a hard-faced Art Deco classicism, [[Augustus John]], and Sir [[Alfred Munnings]] if horses were involved.  Munnings was President of the Royal Academy 1944–1949 and led a jeering hostility to Modernism.  The photographers of the period include [[Bill Brandt]], [[Angus McBean]] and the diarist [[Cecil Beaton]].



Henry Moore emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading sculptor, promoted alongside [[Victor Pasmore]], [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] by the [[Festival of Britain]].  The "London School" of figurative painters including [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] have received widespread international recognition,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219-225&lt;/ref&gt; while other painters such as [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]] and [[John Craxton]] are characterized as [[Neo-Romantics]]. [[Graham Sutherland]], the Romantic landscapist [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] (a prolific and popular lithographer), the sculptor [[Elisabeth Frink]], and the industrial townscapes of [[L.S. Lowry]] also contributed to the strong figurative presence in post-war British art.

[[File:LucienFreud.jpg|thumb|200px|Lucian Freud]]
According to William Grimes of ''[[The New York Times]]'' "Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like ''Girl With a White Dog'' (1951-52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter’s social facade. Ordinary people — many of them his friends — stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist’s ruthless inspection."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/arts/lucian-freud-adept-portraiture-artist-dies-at-88.html "Lucian Freud, Figurative Painter Who Redefined Portraiture, Is Dead at 88"].

==Contemporary art==
[[Postmodern art|Post-modern]], contemporary British art, particularly that of the [[Young British Artists]], has been said to be "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture&amp;nbsp;... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual [[Turner Prize]], founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary British art.  Among the beneficiaries have been several members of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBA) movement, which includes [[Damien Hirst]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], and [[Tracey Emin]], who rose to prominence after the [[Freeze (exhibition)|''Freeze'' exhibition]] of 1988, with the backing of [[Saatchi Gallery|Charles Saatchi]] and achieved international recognition with their version of [[conceptual art]]. This often featured [[Installation art|installations]], notably Hirst's [[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living|vitrine containing a preserved shark]]. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi's generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of [[Jay Jopling]], the most influential London gallerist.

The [[Sensation (art exhibition)|''Sensation'' exhibition]] of works from the Saatchi Collection was controversial in both the UK and the US, though in different ways.  At the Royal Academy press-generated controversy centred on ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', a very large image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]], but when the show travelled to New York City, opening at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in late 1999, it was met with intense protest about ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was smeared with elephant dung, although Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small [[collage]] images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]]. Among other criticism, New York Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm&gt;

Using natural found materials they are often very ephemeral, and are recorded in photographs of which several collections in book form have been published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/mar/11/art.features3 The Observer, 2007 interview with Andy Goldsworthy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grayson Perry]] works in various media, including ceramics.

'''Artful Learning''' is an educational philosophy model that is concept-based and interdisciplinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |title=Evaluation of the Artful Learning Program |work=cse.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627172329/http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artful Learning was initiated by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and is rooted in using the arts to enhance all areas of education.

==History==
In 1990, Leonard Bernstein received the [[Praemium Imperiale]], an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through
the Arts (BETA) Fund, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/pfr/pfr_FALL05_rev2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Bernstein provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Center&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/lbcenter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, resulting in the Bernstein Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webadrenaline.com/artful-2-3-04/about/mission.html |title=History of the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning |work=webadrenaline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six years of association with the Grammy Foundation, the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moved to [[Gettysburg College]], PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=cfc1e09f-506b-4cc0-ba24-aa67803f635c |title=Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moves to Gettysburg College |work=gettysburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==

Artful Learning is based on Bernstein's philosophy that the arts can strengthen learning and be incorporated in all academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.nl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=dp2013 |title=THE LEONARD BERNSTEIN ARTFUL LEARNING MODEL: A CASE STUDY OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL |work=digitalcommons.nl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is based on "units of study," which each consist of four core elements: experience, inquire, create, and reflect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-bernstein/leonard-bernsteins-artsba_b_3427779.html |title=Leonard Bernstein's Arts-Based Education Revolution |work=huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research shows that participation in the arts plays a vital role in influencing brain development and performance. Arts which are considered enrichment in education programs, may in fact be central to the way humans neurologically process and learn.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507091.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/65g5z7wp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irma-international.org/chapter/artful-learning/106314/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iakFqWZGvhkC&amp;pg=PA1059&amp;lpg=PA1059&amp;dq=research+%2B+%22artful+learning%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IBo6GMysV6&amp;sig=CjaivsVuLUaBhpDD5QQK6VV61t4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0ZeoVIbtD9eJuASxg4KQCQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=research%20%2B%20%22artful%20learning%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] teamed up with the Arts Education Partnership to publish a comprehensive study on the inclusion of the [[arts in education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~bcec/events/RFKS/RFKS2011/artful.html |title=Artful Learning |work=indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association for the Support of Contemporary Living''' ({{lang-tr|Çağdaş Yaşamı Destekleme Derneği}}) is a non-profit NGO in [[Turkey]]. The main office is in [[İstanbul]] and there are 103 branch offices nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp Branch office list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230000000/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association helps girls across Turkey obtain an education, ultimately promoting gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Istanbul|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melis-figanmese/women-of-istanbul_b_3081257.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Association for the Support of Contemporary Living (abbreviated ÇYDD) was founded on 10 February 1989 by a group of Turkish female academicians headed by [[Aysel Ekşi]] and [[Türkan Saylan]] in İstanbul.&lt;ref name="Tarih"&gt;[http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html Chronology from the ÇYDD youth page {{tr icon}})] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001114/http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next year Türkan Saylan was elected as the chairperson of the ÇYDD; from then on she became the symbol of ÇYDD. In the same year branch offices of ÇYDD began to be opened in other cities. In 1995 a subsidiary foundation of ÇYDD was founded. On 18 May 2009 Türkan Saylan died and in the next week, [[Aysel Çelikel]] a [[57th government of Turkey|former government]] minister became the next chairperson.&lt;ref name="Tarih"/&gt;

==Purpose==
ÇYDD supports the modernization [[Atatürk's reforms|reforms]] of [[Kemal Atatürk]]. The official statement of ÇYDD is 

:"The Association for Supporting Contemporary Life is a non-governmental organization, working voluntarily with its competencies and experience, aiming to protect Atatürk’s principles and revolutions, to reach contemporary society via contemporary education for contemporary people and to carry Turkey above the contemporary civilization level". “&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=22 Purpose declaration of ÇYDD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233839/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=22 |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ÇYDD is especially active in fighting against the gender discrimination and illiteracy of women.

The center was established in 1965 on the ''[[commune (France)|commune]]'' of [[Le Barp]] between [[Bordeaux]] and [[Arcachon]].

The center will host in the future the [[Megajoule laser]] (LMJ), which will enable French nuclear scientists to validate models of nuclear explosion without having to conduct [[nuclear testing]]. The LMJ is the French equivalent of the [[National Ignition Facility]].

[[File:CI types1s 2.jpg|thumb|460px|{{center|Types of collective intelligence}}]]
{{Recommender systems}}
'''Collective intelligence''' ('''CI''') is shared or group intelligence that [[Emergence|emerges]] from the [[collaboration]], collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in [[consensus decision making]]. The term appears in [[sociobiology]], [[political science]] and in context of mass [[peer review]] and [[crowdsourcing]] applications. It may involve [[consensus]], [[social capital]] and formalisms such as [[voting systems]], [[social media]] and other means of quantifying mass activity.  Collective IQ is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Collective intelligence has also been attributed to [[bacteria]]&lt;ref name="Nguyen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ngoc Thanh Nguyen|title=Transactions on Computational Collective Intelligence III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUxv25JFTkkC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=25 July 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-19967-7|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} and animals.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2011"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

It can be understood as an [[emergent property]] from the [[synergies]] among: 1) data-[[information]]-knowledge; 2) software-hardware; and 3) experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C. Collective Intelligence&amp;nbsp;– One of the Next Big Things, Futura 4/2009, Finnish Society for Futures Studies, Helsinki, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; Or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C. Chapter 5, 2008 State of the Future. The Millennium Project, Washington, DC 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as "symbiotic intelligence" by Norman Lee Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lee Johnson, [http://CollectiveScience.com Collective Science site]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is used in [[sociology]], [[Prediction market|business]], [[computer science]] and mass communications: it also appears in [[science fiction]]. [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] defines collective intelligence as, "It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or [[hypostatized]] communities."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lévy, ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'', 1994, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to researchers [[Pierre Lévy]] and [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], it refers to capacity of networked [[ICTs]] (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry ''New Media: An Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective intelligence strongly contributes to the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to [[Eric S. Raymond]] (1998) and JC Herz (2005), [[open source]] intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations ([[Terry Flew|Flew]] 2008). Media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. [[Henry Jenkins]] criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, ''Henry Convergence Culture: Where old and new media collide''. New York: New York University Press, 2006, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pierre Lévy]] (2007) and [[Henry Jenkins]] (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for [[democratization]], as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes to a better understanding of diverse society.

Similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor (''g'')]] for general individual intelligence, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor '''c factor''' for groups indicating a group's ability to perform a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Anita Williams|last2=Chabris|first2=Christopher F.|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Hashmi|first4=Nada|last5=Malone|first5=Thomas W.|date=2010-10-29|title=Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686|journal=Science|language=en|volume=330|issue=6004|pages=686–688|doi=10.1126/science.1193147|pmid=20929725|bibcode=2010Sci...330..686W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are derived from ''g''.

== History ==
[[File:World Brain HG Wells 1938.jpg|left|thumb|H.G. Wells ''World Brain'' (1936–1938)]]
The concept (although not so named) originated in 1785 with the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], whose "jury theorem" states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases with the number of members of the group (see [[Condorcet's jury theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landemore|first1=Hélène|title=Landemore, Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many theorists have interpreted [[Aristotle]]'s statement in the [[Politics]] that "a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out of a single purse" to mean that just as many may bring different dishes to the table, so in a deliberation many may contribute different pieces of information to generate a better decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=Jeremy|title=The Wisdom of the Multitude: Some Reflections on Book 3, Chapter 11 of Aristotle's Politics|journal=Political Theory|date=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=563–584|doi=10.1177/0090591795023004001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ober|first1=Josiah|title=Democracy and Knowledge|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=110–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cammack|first1=Daniela|title=Aristotle and the Virtue of the Multitude|journal=Political Theory|date=2013|volume=41|issue=2|pages=175–202|doi=10.1177/0090591712470423}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, suggests that this was probably not what Aristotle meant but is a modern interpretation based on what we now know about team intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Page|first1=Scott|title=The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor of the concept is found in entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler]]'s observation that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism (1910)&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W. M. (1910). Ants: their structure, development and behavior (Vol. 9). Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in [[ants]] that acted like the cells of a single beast he called a [[superorganism]].

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]] identified society as the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in "[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]" that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'', 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Other antecedents are [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s concept of "[[noosphere]]" and [[H.G. Wells]]'s concept of "[[world brain]]" (see also the term "[[global brain]]"). Peter Russell, [[Elisabet Sahtouris]], and [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]] (originator of the term "conscious evolution")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://barbaramarxhubbard.com/book/|title=About the Book – Foundation for Conscious Evolution|newspaper=Foundation for Conscious Evolution|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; are inspired by the visions of a noosphere&amp;nbsp;– a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence&amp;nbsp;– an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]]. In a 1962 research report, [[Douglas Engelbart]] linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: "Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone".&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1962) [http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9 Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework] – section on Team Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society.&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1994)[https://archive.org/stream/boostingcollecti00drdo#page/n9/mode/2up Boosting Collective IQ] (Slide Handouts)&amp;nbsp;– 'Collective IQ' defined on Slide 4; also (1994) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdIWQZtEq04&amp;t=1016 BBN Distinguished Guest Lecture] (Video)&amp;nbsp;– 'Collective IQ' defined @16:56 "CoDIAK"&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of collective intelligence also forms the framework for contemporary democratic theories often referred to as [[epistemic democracy]]. Epistemic democratic theories refer to the capacity of the populace, either through deliberation or aggregation of knowledge, to track the truth and relies on mechanisms to synthesize and apply collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landemore|first1=Helene|title=Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Bloom]] has discussed mass behavior – [[collective behavior]] from the level of quarks to the level of bacterial, plant, animal, and human societies. He stresses the biological adaptations that have turned most of this earth's living beings into components of what he calls "a learning machine". In 1986 Bloom combined the concepts of [[apoptosis]], [[parallel distributed processing]], [[group selection]], and the superorganism to produce a theory of how collective intelligence works.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Bloom, ''The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Later he showed how the collective intelligences of competing bacterial colonies and human societies can be explained in terms of computer-generated "[[complex adaptive systems]]" and the "[[genetic algorithms]]", concepts pioneered by [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref name="bloom2000"/&gt;

Bloom traced the evolution of collective intelligence to our bacterial ancestors 1 billion years ago and demonstrated how a multi-species intelligence has worked since the beginning of life.&lt;ref name="bloom2000"&gt;Howard Bloom, ''Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Ant societies exhibit more intelligence, in terms of technology, than any other animal except for humans and co-operate in keeping livestock, for example [[aphid]]s for "milking".&lt;ref name="bloom2000" /&gt; Leaf cutters care for fungi and carry leaves to feed the fungi.&lt;ref name="bloom2000" /&gt;

He develops the concept of a 'group mind' as articulated by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in "Leviathan" and [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner]]'s arguments for a [[collective consciousness]] of mankind. He cites [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] as the most notable advocate of a "collective consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Er3lCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=david+skrbina+durkheim#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Authenticity, Autonomy and Multiculturalism|last=Levey|first=Geoffrey Brahm|date=2015-05-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317535928|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Teilhard de Chardin]] as a thinker who has developed the philosophical implications of the group mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panpsychism in the West|last=Skrbina|first=David F.|date=2007-01-26|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262693516|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Atlee focuses primarily on humans and on work to upgrade what Howard Bloom calls "the group IQ". Atlee feels that collective intelligence can be encouraged "to overcome '[[groupthink]]' and individual [[cognitive bias]] in order to allow a collective to cooperate on one process – while achieving enhanced intellectual performance." George Pór defined the collective intelligence phenomenon as "the capacity of human communities to evolve towards higher order complexity and harmony, through such innovation mechanisms as differentiation and integration, competition and collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;George Pór, [http://www.community-intelligence.com/blogs/public Blog of Collective Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; Atlee and Pór state that "collective intelligence also involves achieving a single focus of attention and standard of metrics which provide an appropriate threshold of action".&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community-intelligence.com/files/Atlee%20-%20Por%20-%20CI%20as%20a%20Field%20of%20multidisciplinary%20study%20and%20practice%20.pdf|title=Collective Intelligence as a Field of Multi‐disciplinary Study and Practice|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=|website=Community Intelligence|publisher=CommunityIntelligence. Ltd|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach is rooted in [[scientific community metaphor]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

The term group intelligence is sometimes used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence as a measure of group intelligence and group creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea is that a measure of collective intelligence covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The features of composition that lead to increased levels of collective intelligence in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

Atlee and Pór suggest that the field of collective intelligence should primarily be seen as a human enterprise in which mind-sets, a willingness to share and an openness to the value of distributed intelligence for the common good are paramount, though group theory and [[artificial intelligence]] have something to offer.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Individuals who respect collective intelligence are confident of their own abilities and recognize that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of any individual parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leimeister|first=Jan Marco|date=2010-06-24|title=Collective Intelligence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-010-0114-8|journal=Business &amp; Information Systems Engineering|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=245–248|doi=10.1007/s12599-010-0114-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximizing collective intelligence relies on the ability of an organization to accept and develop "The Golden Suggestion", which is any potentially useful input from any member.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; [[Groupthink]] often hampers collective intelligence by limiting input to a select few individuals or filtering potential Golden Suggestions without fully developing them to implementation.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

[[Robert David Steele Vivas]] in ''The New Craft of Intelligence'' portrayed all citizens as "intelligence minutemen," drawing only on legal and ethical sources of information, able to create a "public intelligence" that keeps public officials and corporate managers honest, turning the concept of "national intelligence" (previously concerned about spies and secrecy) on its head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, &amp; Political—Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, &amp; Corruption|last=Steele|first=Robert David|date=2002-04-08|publisher=Oss Pr|isbn=9780971566118|location=Oakton, Va.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mass_collaboration.jpg|thumb|Stigmergic Collaboration: a theoretical framework for mass collaboration]]
According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], collective intelligence is [[mass collaboration]]. In order for this concept to happen, four principles need to exist;&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
; Openness: [[idea sharing|Sharing ideas]] and [[intellectual property]]: though these resources provide the edge over competitors more benefits accrue from allowing others to share ideas and gain significant improvement and scrutiny through collaboration.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; Peering: Horizontal organization as with the 'opening up' of the Linux program where users are free to modify and develop it provided that they make it available for others. Peering succeeds because it encourages [[self-organization]]&amp;nbsp;– a style of production that works more effectively than hierarchical management for certain tasks.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; [[Sharing]]: Companies have started to share some ideas while maintaining some degree of control over others, like potential and critical [[patent rights]]. Limiting all intellectual property shuts out opportunities, while sharing some expands markets and brings out products faster.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; Acting Globally: The advancement in communication technology has prompted the rise of global companies at low overhead costs. The [[internet]] is widespread, therefore a globally integrated company has no geographical boundaries and may access new markets, ideas and technology.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008"&gt;Tapscott, D., &amp; Williams, A. D. (2008). ''Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything'', USA: Penguin Group&lt;/ref&gt;

A new scientific understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|psychometric approach of general individual intelligence]].

=== Processes ===
[[File:Causes for c.png|thumb|Predictors for the collective intelligence factor ''c''. Suggested by Woolley, Aggarwal &amp; Malone&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; (2015)]]

==== Top-down processes ====
Top-down processes cover group interaction, such as structures, processes, and norms.&lt;ref name="Woolley 420–424"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=A. W.|last2=Aggarwal|first2=I.|last3=Malone|first3=T.

==== Bottom-up processes ====
Bottom-up processes include group composition,&lt;ref name="Woolley 420–424"/&gt; namely the characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; encompassing. An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, collective intelligence was found to be related to a group's cognitive diversity&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Aggarwal, I. |author2=Woolley, A.

Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Serial vs Parallel processes ====

For most of human history, collective intelligence was confined to small tribal groups in which opinions were aggregated through real-time parallel interactions among members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871336785|title=Moral tribes : emotion, reason, and the gap between us and them|last=1974–|first=Greene, Joshua David,|isbn=0143126059|oclc=871336785}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In modern times, mass communication, mass media, and networking technologies have enabled collective intelligence to span massive groups, distributed across continents and time-zones.  To accommodate this shift in scale, collective intelligence in large-scale groups been dominated by serialized polling processes such as aggregating up-votes, likes, and ratings over time.  While modern systems benefit from larger group size, the serialized process has been found to introduce substantial noise that distorts the collective output of the group.  In one significant study of serialized collective intelligence, it was found that the first vote contributed to a serialized voting system can distort the final result by 34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muchnik|first=Lev|last2=Aral|first2=Sinan|last3=Taylor|first3=Sean J.|date=2013-08-09|title=Social Influence Bias: A Randomized Experiment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647|journal=Science|language=en|volume=341|issue=6146|pages=647–651|doi=10.1126/science.1240466|issn=0036-8075|pmid=23929980|bibcode=2013Sci...341..647M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the problems of serialized aggregation of input among large-scale groups, recent advancements collective intelligence have worked to replace serialized votes, polls, and markets, with parallel systems such as "[[Swarm intelligence|human swarms]]" modeled after synchronous swarms in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161215-why-bees-could-be-the-secret-to-superhuman-intelligence|title=Why bees could be the secret to superhuman intelligence|last=Oxenham|first=Simon|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=L.|last2=Baltaxe|first2=D.|last3=Pescetelli|first3=N.|date=2016-10-01|title=Crowds vs swarms, a comparison of intelligence|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780278/|journal=2016 Swarm/Human Blended Intelligence Workshop (SHBI)|pages=1–4|doi=10.1109/SHBI.2016.7780278|isbn=978-1-5090-3502-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on natural process of [[Swarm Intelligence]], these artificial swarms of networked humans enable participants to work together in parallel to answer questions and make predictions as an emergent collective intelligence.  In one high-profile example, a human swarm challenge by CBS Interactive to predict the Kentucky Derby.  The swarm correctly predicted the first four horses, in order, defying 542–1 odds and turning a $20 bet into $10,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/artificial-intelligence-turns-20-11000-kentucky-derby-bet-457783|title=Artificial intelligence turns $20 into $11,000 in Kentucky Derby bet|date=2016-05-10|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence ===

''c'' and average (maximum) member intelligence  scores are regressed on the criterion tasks.]]
Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, &amp; Malone (2010),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the originators of this scientific understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly recruited from the public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the [[The Circumplex Model of Group Tasks|McGrath Task Circumplex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Groups: Interaction and Performance|last=McGrath, J. E.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a [[factor analysis]]. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor ''c'' underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a [[G factor (psychometrics)|general individual intelligence factor ''g'']] typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
Afterwards, a more complex criterion task was absolved by each group measuring whether the extracted ''c'' factor had predictive power for performance outside the original task batteries. Criterion tasks were playing [[Draughts|checkers (draughts)]] against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a [[regression analysis]] using both individual intelligence of group members and ''c'' to predict performance on the criterion tasks, ''c'' had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with ''c'', ''c'' was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor ''c,'' because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that ''c'' is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Engel et al.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al.,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes. The online collaborating participants, however, did neither know nor see each other at all. The authors conclude that scores on the RME must be related to a broader set of abilities of social reasoning than only drawing inferences from other people's eye expressions.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=David|last2=Woolley|first2=Anita Williams|last3=Aggarwal|first3=Ishani|last4=Chabris|first4=Christopher F.|last5=Takahashi|first5=Masamichi|last6=Nemoto|first6=Keiichi|last7=Kaiser|first7=Carolin|last8=Kim|first8=Young Ji|last9=Malone|first9=Thomas W.|date=2015-01-01|title=Collective Intelligence in Computer-Mediated Collaboration Emerges in Different Contexts and Cultures|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2702123.2702259|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=3769–3778|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702259|isbn=9781450331456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, various proposals and working papers are in progress or already completed but (supposedly) still in a [[scholarly peer review]]ing publication process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/collective-intelligence-conference/|title=Collective Intelligence 2016|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/collectiveintelligence/posters/|title=Posters {{!}} Collective Intelligence 2015|website=sites.lsa.umich.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collective.mech.northwestern.edu/?page_id=217|title=Proceedings {{!}} Collective Intelligence 2014|website=collective.mech.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint=1204.2991|last1= Malone|first1= Thomas W.|title= Collective Intelligence 2012: Proceedings|author2= Luis von Ahn|class= cs.SI|year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predictive validity ===
Next to predicting a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks as shown in the original experiments,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the collective intelligence factor ''c'' was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thereby, highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Schmidt, F.L. |author2= Hunter, J.E. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1998|title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue= 2 |pages=262–274|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative mathematical techniques ==
=== Computational collective intelligence ===
[[File:Computational collective intelligence.jpg|thumb|Computational Collective Intelligence, by Tadeusz Szuba]]
In 2001, Tadeusz (Tad) Szuba from the [[Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza|AGH University]] in Poland proposed a formal model for the phenomenon of collective intelligence. It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.&lt;ref name="szuba"&gt;Szuba T., ''Computational Collective Intelligence'', 420 pages, Wiley NY, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Thus, a non-[[Alan Turing|Turing]] model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of [[social structure]] and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as "the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure".&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies.&lt;ref name="szuba"/&gt;

=== Collective intelligence quotient ===
One measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a "collective intelligence quotient"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tHmKrpSeEQC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=collective+intelligence+quotient#v=onepage&amp;q=collective%20intelligence%20quotient&amp;f=false|title=Computational Collective Intelligence.

== Applications ==
''Elicitation of point estimates'' – Here, we try to get an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as are seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.

''Opinion Aggregation'' – In this situation, we gather opinions from the crowd regarding some idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon’s star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users.

''Idea Collection'' – In these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a data science problem (as in Kaggle) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in Threadless) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk). Here, the objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas.

[[New media]] are often associated with the promotion and enhancement of collective intelligence. The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources {{Harv|Flew|2008}} resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users.

[[Francis Heylighen]], [[Valentin Turchin]], and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and [[cybernetics]]. In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a [[global brain]].
[[File:Global_brain.jpg|thumb|The makeup of a global brain]]
The developer of the World Wide Web, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. [[J.C.R. Licklider]], demanded more accessibility and utility.&lt;ref name="Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23"&gt;Weiss, A. (2005). The Power of Collective Intelligence. Collective Intelligence, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. [[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture {{Harv|Flew|2008}}. He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES?

[[Pierre Lévy|Lévy]] and [[Derrick de Kerckhove|de Kerckhove]] consider CI from a mass communications perspective, focusing on the ability of networked information and communication technologies to enhance the community knowledge pool. They suggest that these communications tools enable humans to interact and to share and collaborate with both ease and speed (Flew 2008). With the development of the [[Internet]] and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as [[Wikipedia]], is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to "harness the hive"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media: an introduction.|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Oxford University Press.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]] research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html MIT Center for Collective Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |date=11 June 2010 }}.

In this context collective intelligence is often confused with [[shared knowledge]]. The former is the sum total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture''. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Collective intelligence as represented by [[Web 2.0]] has less user engagement than [[collaborative intelligence]]. An art project using Web 2.0 platforms is "Shared Galaxy", an experiment developed by an anonymous artist to create a collective identity that shows up as one person on several platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and Second Life. The password is written in the profiles and the accounts named "Shared Galaxy" are open to be used by anyone. In this way many take part in being one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scardamalia|first=Marlene|last2=Bereiter|first2=Carl|date=1994-07-01|title=Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327809jls0303_3|journal=Journal of the Learning Sciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0303_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another art project using collective intelligence to produce artistic work is Curatron, where a large group of artists together decides on a smaller group that they think would make a good collaborative group.

Recent research using data from the social bookmarking website [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of [[complex system]]s (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]]) dynamics.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" &gt;Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proceedings 6th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211–220, ACM Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/1460563.1460600|last1=Fu|first1=Wai-Tat|title=Semantic imitation in social tagging|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|pages=229|year=2010|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1806926|isbn=9781605580074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fu|first1=Wai-Tat|title=A Semantic Imitation Model of Social Tagging.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE conference on Social Computing|pages=66–72|date=August 2009|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5283882&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5283882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" /&gt; Once such stable distributions form, examining the [[correlation]]s between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies.&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocabularies can be seen as a form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users.

==== P2P business ====
Research performed by Tapscott and Williams has provided a few examples of the benefits of collective intelligence to business:&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

;Talent utilization
:At the rate technology is changing, no firm can fully keep up in the innovations needed to compete. Instead, smart firms are drawing on the power of mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
;Demand creation
:Firms can create a new market for complementary goods by engaging in open source community. Firms also are able to expand into new fields that they previously would not have been able to without the addition of resources and collaboration from the community. This creates, as mentioned before, a new market for complementary goods for the products in said new fields.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
;Costs reduction
:Mass collaboration can help to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The results will be more personal, robust and error-free products created in a short amount of time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R&amp;D outside the confines of the company.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

==== Open source software ====
Cultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the [[Trainz]] product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon "the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software".&lt;ref name="jbanks"&gt;John A.L. Banks. ''Negotiating Participatory Culture in the New Media Environment: Auran and the Trainz Online Community&amp;nbsp;– An (Im)possible Relation'', The University of Queensland. School of English, Media Studies and Art History. MelbourneDAC2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in user created content and interactivity gives rise to issues of control over the game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig&lt;ref&gt;L, Lessig,(2006)Code Version 2.0 (2nd ed.). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bray and Konsynski,&lt;ref&gt;Bray, DA &amp; Konsynski, BR, 2007, ''Virtual Worlds, Virtual Economies, Virtual Institutions'', viewed 10 October 2008, p. 1-27 &lt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=962501&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[intellectual property]] and property ownership rights.

Gosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of [[alternate reality gaming]]. This genre, he describes as an "across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences"&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Gosney, J.W, 2005, ''Beyond Reality: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming'', Thomson Course Technology, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; as events that happen outside the game reality "reach out" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires "the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players"; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and "collective intelligence" in order to solve the mystery of the game.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Benefits of co-operation ====
Co-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co-operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits.

For example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves."&lt;ref name="Surowiecki"&gt;Surowiecki, J., 2007 'The Wisdom of crowds. Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few'&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Coordination ===
==== Ad-hoc communities ====
Military, trade unions, and corporations satisfy some definitions of CI – the most rigorous definition would require a capacity to respond to very arbitrary conditions without orders or guidance from "law" or "customers" to constrain actions. Online advertising companies are using collective intelligence to bypass traditional marketing and creative agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sang M., et al. "Success factors of platform leadership in web 2.0 service business." Service Business 4.2 (2010): 89–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://unu.ai/ UNU] open platform for "human swarming" (or "social swarming") establishes real-time closed-loop systems around groups of networked users molded after biological swarms, enabling human participants to behave as a unified collective intelligence.&lt;ref name="Human Swarms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/life/swarms-of-humans-power-a-i-platform-150603.htm|title=Swarms of Humans Power A.I.

Specialized information sites such as Digital Photography Review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/|title=Digital Photography Review|website=www.dpreview.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Camera Labs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameralabs.com/|title=Camera reviews, DSLR reviews, lens reviews, photography guides {{!}} Cameralabs|website=www.cameralabs.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of collective intelligence. Anyone who has an access to the internet can contribute to distributing their knowledge over the world through the specialized information sites.

In [[learner-generated context]] a group of users marshal resources to create an ecology that meets their needs often (but not only) in relation to the co-configuration, co-creation and co-design of a particular learning space that allows learners to create their own context.&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., du Boulay, B., Smith, H., Underwood, J., Fitzpatrick, G., Holmberg, J., Kerawalla, L., Tunley, H., Brewster, D. and Pearce, D. (2005), 'Using Mobile Technology to Create Flexible Learning Contexts '. Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R. (2006), Understanding Learning Contexts as Ecologies of Resources: From the Zone of Proximal Development to Learner Generated Contexts. Paper presented at the Proceedings of World Conference on Elearning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., Shurville, S. and Browne, T. (2007), 'Initiating elearning by stealth, participation and consultation in a late majority institution'. Organisational Transformation and Social Change, 3, 4, 317–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Learner-generated contexts represent an ''ad hoc'' community that facilitates coordination of collective action in a network of trust. An example of learner-generated context is found on the Internet when collaborative users pool knowledge in a "[[shared intelligence]] space". As the Internet has developed so has the concept of CI as a shared public forum. The global accessibility and availability of the Internet has allowed more people than ever to contribute and access ideas. (Flew 2008)

Games such as ''[[The Sims]]'' Series, and ''[[Second Life]]'' are designed to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations.&lt;ref name="Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23"/&gt; For them, collective intelligence has become a norm. In Terry Flew's discussion of '[[interactivity]]' in the online games environment, the ongoing interactive dialogue between users and game developers,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture" in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; he refers to [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]]'s concept of Collective Intelligence {{Harv|Lévy|1998}} and argues this is active in videogames as clans or guilds in [[MMORPG]] constantly work to achieve goals. [[Henry Jenkins]] proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new participatory culture arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Jenkins (2002) in Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) ''Games: Technology, Industry, Culture'' in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content. Secondly, the rise of subcultures promoting such creations, and lastly, the growth of value adding media conglomerates, which foster image, idea and narrative flow.

==== Coordinating collective actions ====
[[File:Improvisational_actors.jpg|thumb|The cast of After School Improv learns an important lesson about improvisation and life]]
Improvisational actors also experience a type of collective intelligence which they term "group mind", as theatrical improvisation relies on mutual cooperation and agreement,&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=Dusya|last2=Crossan|first2=Mary|date=2004-06-01|title=Theatrical Improvisation: Lessons for Organizations|url=http://oss.sagepub.com/content/25/5/727|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=25|issue=5|pages=727–749|doi=10.1177/0170840604042412}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the unity of "group mind".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=*|first=R.

Growth of the Internet and mobile telecom has also produced "swarming" or "rendezvous" events that enable meetings or even dates on demand.&lt;ref name="Wolpert arXiv:cs/9905004"/&gt; The full impact has yet to be felt but the [[anti-globalization movement]], for example, relies heavily on e-mail, cell phones, pagers, SMS and other means of organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vskz1poDuvoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=anti+globalization+collective+intelligence#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Globalization / Anti-Globalization: Beyond the Great Divide|last=Held|first=David|last2=McGrew|first2=Anthony|date=2007-11-19|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745639116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] organization does this in a more journalistic way.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2001/09/11129.html|title='Anti-Globals' Use Internet As Collective Intelligence – UK Indymedia|website=www.indymedia.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such resources could combine into a form of collective intelligence accountable only to the current participants yet with some strong moral or linguistic guidance from generations of contributors – or even take on a more obviously democratic form to advance shared goal.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==== Coordination in different types of tasks ====
Collective actions or tasks require different amounts of coordination depending on the complexity of the task. Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: "When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kittur, A., Lee, B. and Kraut, R. E. (2009) 'Coordination in collective intelligence: The role of team structure and task interdependence', Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1495–1504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group collective intelligence is a property that emerges through coordination from both bottom-up and top-down processes. In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work.&lt;ref&gt;[18] Woolley, A. W., Aggarwal, I. and Malone, T. W. (2015) 'Collective Intelligence and Group Performance', Current Directions in Psychological Science, 24(6), pp. 420–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative views ==
===A tool for combating self-preservation===

Tom Atlee reflects that, although humans have an innate ability to gather and analyze data, they are affected by culture, education and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YV4dCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|title=In Search of The Black Seed|last=Abdul-Karim|first=Kashif|date=2015-11-23|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329694897|language=en|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single person tends to make decisions motivated by self-preservation. Therefore, without collective intelligence, humans may drive themselves into extinction based on their selfish needs.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Atlee, T. (2008). [http://www.communicationagents.com/tom_atlee/2008/05/15/reflections_on_the_evolution_of_choice_and_collective_intelligence.htm Reflections on the evolution of choice and collective intelligence], Retrieved 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation from IQism===
Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder quotes Bowles and [[Herbert Gintis|Gintis]] (1976) that in order to truly define collective intelligence, it is crucial to separate 'intelligence' from IQism.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jun/18/socialsciences.highereducation1|title=Capitalism and Social Progress by Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder (cont... )|date=2001-06-18|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to argue that intelligence is an achievement and can only be developed if allowed to.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; For example, earlier on, groups from the lower levels of society are severely restricted from aggregating and pooling their intelligence. This is because the elites fear that the collective intelligence would convince the people to rebel. If there is no such capacity and relations, there would be no infrastructure on which collective intelligence is built {{Harv|Brown|Lauder|2000|p=230}}. This reflects how powerful collective intelligence can be if left to develop.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

===Artificial intelligence views===
Skeptics, especially those critical of artificial intelligence and more inclined to believe that risk of [[bodily harm]] and bodily action are the basis of all unity between people, are more likely to emphasize the capacity of a group to take action and withstand harm as one fluid [[mass mobilization]], shrugging off harms the way a body shrugs off the loss of a few cells.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnzerzan.net/radio/|title=John Zerzan: anti-civilization theorist, writer and speaker|website=www.johnzerzan.net|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jason W.|date=2001-01-01|editor-last=Arrighi|editor-first=Giovanni|editor2-last=Silver|editor2-first=Beverly J.|title=Globalization in Historical Perspective|journal=Science &amp; Society|volume=65|issue=3|pages=386–397|doi=10.1521/siso.65.3.386.17767|jstor=40403938}}&lt;/ref&gt;This strain of thought is most obvious in the [[anti-globalization movement]] and characterized by the works of [[John Zerzan]], [[Carol Moore]], and [[Starhawk]], who typically shun academics.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"/&gt; These theorists are more likely to refer to ecological and [[collective wisdom]] and to the role of [[consensus process]] in making ontological distinctions than to any form of "intelligence" as such, which they often argue does not exist, or is mere "cleverness".&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"/&gt;

Harsh critics of artificial intelligence on ethical grounds are likely to promote collective wisdom-building methods, such as the [[new tribalists]] and the [[Gaianism|Gaians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metamorphoptics.blogspot.com/|title=m e t a m o r p h o p t i c s|website=metamorphoptics.blogspot.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these can be said to be collective intelligence systems is an open question. Some, e.g. [[Bill Joy]], simply wish to avoid any form of autonomous artificial intelligence and seem willing to work on rigorous collective intelligence in order to remove any possible niche for AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us|last=Joy|first=Bill|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these views, Artificial Intelligence companies such as [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[CrowdFlower]] are using collective intelligence and [[crowdsourcing]] or [[consensus-based assessment]] to collect the enormous amounts of data for [[machine learning]] algorithms such as [[Keras]] and [[IBM Watson]].

=== Solving climate change ===
Global collective intelligence is also seen as the key in solving the challenges that the humankind faces now and in the future. [[Climate change]] is an example of a global issue which collective intelligence is currently trying to tackle. With the help of collective intelligence applications such as online [[crowdsourcing]] people across the globe are collaborating in developing solutions to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/crowdsourcing-climate-change-solutions/|title=How Millions of People Can Help Solve Climate Change — NOVA Next {{!}} PBS|date=2014-01-15|work=NOVA Next|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The Si2 '''Common Power Format''', or '''CPF''' is a [[file format]] for specifying power-saving techniques early in the design process.  In the design of [[integrated circuit]]s, saving power is a primary goal, and designers are forced to use sophisticated techniques such as [[clock gating]], multi-voltage logic, and turning off the power entirely to inactive blocks.  These techniques require a consistent implementation in the design steps of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|logic design]], implementation, and verification.  For example, if multiple different power supplies are used, then [[logic synthesis]] must insert level shifters, [[Placement (EDA)|place]] and [[Routing (EDA)|route]] must deal with them correctly, and other tools such as [[static timing analysis]] and [[formal verification]] must understand these components.  As power became an increasingly pressing concern, each tool independently added the features needed.  Although this made it possible to build low power flows, it was difficult and error prone since the same information needed to be specified several times, in several formats, to many different tools.  CPF was created as a common format that many tools can use to specify power-specific data, so that power intent only need be entered once and can be used consistently by all tools.  The aim of CPF is to support an automated, power-aware design infrastructure.

Associated with CPF is the [[Power Forward Initiative]] (PFI), a group of companies that collaborate to drive low-power design methodology and have contributed to the development of the CPF v1.0 specification. PFI membership spans [[Electronic Design Automation|EDA]], IP, library, foundry fabs, ASIC, IDM, and equipment companies. In March 2007, CPF v1.0 was contributed to the [[Silicon Integration Initiative]] (Si2) where it was ratified by Si2’s Low Power Coalition (LPC) as a Si2 standard. The LPC controls the ongoing evolution of the CPF v1.0 standard.

== Contents ==
Constructs expressing power domains and their power supplies:
* Logical design: hierarchical modules can be specified as belonging to specific power supply domains
* Physical design: explicit power/ground nets and connectivity can be specified per cell or block.
* Analysis: different timing library data for cases where the same cell is used in different power domains

Power control logic
* Specification of level shifter logic - special cells needed when signals traverse between blocks of different supply voltage.
* Specification of isolation logic - what special logic is needed for signals that traverse between blocks that can be powered up and down independently.
* Specification of state-retention logic - when blocks are switched off entirely, how is the state retained?
* Specification of switch logic and control signals - how are blocks switched on and off?

Definition and verification of power modes (standby, sleep, etc.)
* Mode definitions
* Mode transition expressions

== History and controversy ==

[[Cadence Design Systems]] designed the early versions of CPF,&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ping Hsu, [http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193600111 Pushing Power Forward with a Common Power Format - The Process of Getting it Right], EETimes, 5 Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt; then contributed it to Si2.  This was followed shortly by an alternative effort, the [[Unified Power Format]] or '''UPF''', proposed as an [[IEEE#Standards and the IEEE Standards Development Process|IEEE standard]] as opposed to an Si2 standard.  UPF has been driven mainly by [[Synopsys]], [[Mentor Graphics]] and [[Magma Design Automation|Magma]].  The technical differences between the two formats are relatively minor, but the political considerations are harder to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Goering, Richard, [http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;?articleID=198100646 IC power standards convergence falters], EETimes, 21 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goering, Richard, [http://www.industrialcontroldesignline.com/news/199202963; IEEE's patent policy fails to quell EDA standards row], EEtimes, 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not surprisingly, the Cadence Low-Power Solution supported Si2’s CPF very early on, as well as UPF as it emerged; whereas the Synopsys, and Mentor Graphics offerings all support UPF. Magma supports both CPF and UPF.

An attempt at convergence is taking place in the Low Power Coalition at Si2.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silicon Integration Initiative]], [http://www.si2.org/?page=984 CPF 1.2 Roadmap], 17 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coronal loops''' form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the [[Sun]]. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic flux]] within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the [[solar cycle]]; it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with [[sunspots]] at their footpoints. The upwelling magnetic flux pushes through the [[photosphere]], exposing a cooler plasma in footpoints. This plasma is cooler because of the magnetic field radially directed which stop the convective process in these regions. Then heat can't be transported toward the surface by convection, and the contrast between the photosphere and this cooler plasma gives the impression of dark spots, or sunspots.

==Physical features==
[[Image:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A diagram showing the evolution of the solar magnetic flux over one solar cycle.]]
[[Image:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of the low [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], where many scales of coronal loops can be observed.]]

A coronal loop is magnetic [[flux]] fixed at both ends, threading through the solar body, protruding into the solar atmosphere. They are ideal structures to observe when trying to understand the transfer of energy from the solar body, through the transition region and into the corona.

Many scales of coronal loops exist, neighbouring open flux tubes that give way to the [[solar wind]] and reach far into the corona and heliosphere. Anchored in the photosphere (a rigid, [[magnetohydrodynamics|line-tied]], anchor is assumed where the high-β, external plasma holds the loop footpoints in place), coronal loops project through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], extending high into the [[corona]].

Also, coronal loops have a wide variety of temperatures along their lengths. Loops existing at temperatures below 1&amp;nbsp;MK are generally known as cool loops, those existing at around 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as warm loops, and those beyond 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as hot loops. Naturally, these different categories radiate at different wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Location===
Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface. Active regions on the solar surface take up small areas but produce the majority of activity and are often the source of flares and [[Coronal Mass Ejection]]s due to the [[Magnetic reconnection|intense magnetic field]] present. Active regions produce 82% of the total coronal heating energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The quiet Sun makes up the rest of the solar surface. The quiet Sun, although less active than active regions, is awash with [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] processes and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] events (bright points, [[nanoflares]] and jets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, the quiet Sun exists in regions of closed magnetic structures, and active regions are highly dynamic sources of explosive events. It is important to note that observations suggest the whole corona is massively populated by open and closed magnetic fieldlines.

===Coronal loops and the coronal heating problem===
[[Image:Energyfig.png|thumb|A modelled example of a quiescent coronal loop (energy contributions).]]

A closed fieldline does not constitute a coronal loop; however, closed flux must be ''filled with plasma'' before it can be called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi = 10.1086/172927
| bibcode=1993ApJ...412..375L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism behind plasma filling, dynamic flows and coronal heating remains a mystery. The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000&amp;nbsp;K to well over 1&amp;nbsp;MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed by chromospheric plasma, protrude into the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.

The idea that the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating mechanism is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a ''chromospheric energization'' and ''coronal heating phenomenon'' possibly linked through a common mechanism.

==History of observations==

===1946–1975===
Many strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], MLSO, in [[Hawaii]]) and [[eclipse]] observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) [[Aerobee (rocket)|Aerobee]] rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, [[spectrogram]]s measured solar EUV and [[Lyman alpha|Lyman-α]] emissions. Basic [[X-ray]] observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The [[Skylark (rocket)|British Skylark rocket]] missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray [[spectrometer]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the period of 1962–1975, the satellite series [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, [[Skylab]] was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wealth of data was accumulated across the whole range of emission.

===1991–present day===
[[Image:Tracemosaic.jpg|thumb|Full-disk mosaic of the million-degree [[Sun]] by [[TRACE]].]]

The solar community was rocked by the launch of ''[[Yohkoh]]'' (Solar A) from [[Kagoshima Space Centre]] in August 1991. It was lost on 14 December 2001 due to battery failure but revolutionised X-ray observations in its decade of operations. ''Yohkoh'' (or ''Sunbeam'') orbited the Earth in an [[elliptical]] [[orbit]], observing X-ray and [[Gamma ray|γ-ray]] emissions from solar phenomena such as solar flares. ''Yohkoh'' carried four instruments. The Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), the Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS), the Soft X-Ray Telescope ([[Yohkoh|SXT]]) and the Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT) were operated by a consortium of scientists from Japan, the USA and the UK. Of particular interest is the [[Yohkoh|SXT]] instrument for observing X-ray-emitting coronal loops.

The SXT instrument observed X-rays in the 0.25–4.0&amp;nbsp;[[SI units|keV]] range, resolving solar features to 2.5 arc seconds with a temporal resolution of 0.5–2 seconds. SXT was sensitive to plasma in the 2–4&amp;nbsp;MK temperature range, making it an ideal observational platform to compare with data collected from [[TRACE]] coronal loops radiating in the EUV wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | volume = 188
  | pages = 1–9
  | year = 2002
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major step in solar physics came at the launch of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) in December 1995 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], USA. SOHO originally had an operational lifetime of two years. The mission was extended to March 2007 due to its resounding success, allowing SOHO to observe a complete 11-year solar cycle. SOHO continually faces the Sun holding a slow orbit around the First [[Lagrangian Point]] (L1), where the gravitational balance between the Sun and Earth provides a stable position for SOHO to orbit. SOHO is continually eclipsing the Sun from the Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometres.

SOHO is managed by scientists from the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and NASA. Containing more instruments than both TRACE and Yohkoh, this large solar mission was designed to look at the chain from the solar interior, the solar corona to the solar wind. SOHO has 12 instruments on board, including the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS), the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) and the UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS), which are all used extensively in the study of the transition region and corona.

The EIT instrument is used extensively in coronal loop observations. EIT images the transition region through to the inner corona by utilising four band passes, 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV and 304&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HeII, each corresponding to different EUV temperatures, probing the [[chromospheric network]] to the lower corona.

The [[TRACE|Transition Region And Coronal Explorer]] ([[TRACE]]) was launched in April 1998 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] as part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Small Explorer (SMEX) project. The small orbiting instrument has a 30×160&amp;nbsp;cm, 8.66&amp;nbsp;m focal length Cassegrain telescope with a 1200×1200px CCD detector. The timing of the launch was planned to coincide with the rising phase of the solar maximum. Observations of the transition region and lower corona could then be carried out in conjunction with SOHO to give an unprecedented view of the solar environment during this exciting phase of the solar cycle.

Due to the high spatial (1 arc second) and temporal resolution (1–5 seconds), TRACE has been able to capture highly detailed images of coronal structures, whilst SOHO provides the global (lower resolution) picture of the Sun. This campaign demonstrates the observatory's ability to track the evolution of steady-state (or [[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]) coronal loops. TRACE utilizes filters that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV, 1216&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HI, 1550&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;CIV and 1600&amp;nbsp;Å range. Of particular interest are the 171&amp;nbsp;Å, 195&amp;nbsp;Å and 284&amp;nbsp;Å band passes, as they are sensitive to the radiation emitted by quiescent coronal loops.

==Dynamic flows==
[[Image:SOLAR-B artists concept.jpg|thumb|The new solar observatory ''[[Hinode]]'' (Solar-B), launched September 2006, will observe the magnetic structure of the corona.]]

All of the above space missions have been highly successful in observing strong plasma flows and highly dynamic processes in coronal loops. For example, SUMER observations suggest flow velocities of 5–16&amp;nbsp;km/s in the solar disk, and other
joint SUMER/TRACE observations detect flows of 15–40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Cross-cultural psychiatry''' (also known as '''transcultural psychiatry''' or '''cultural psychiatry''') is a branch of [[psychiatry]] concerned with the [[cultural]] context of [[mental disorder]]s and the challenges of addressing [[ethnic]] diversity in psychiatric services. It emerged as a coherent field from several strands of work, including surveys of the [[prevalence]] and form of disorders in different cultures or countries; the study of [[immigrant|migrant]] populations and ethnic diversity within countries; and analysis of psychiatry itself as a cultural product.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirmayer LJ|chapter=Cultural psychiatry in historical perspective|editor1=Bhui, Kamaldeep|editor2=Bhugra, Dinesh|title=Textbook of cultural psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2007|pages= 3–19|isbn=0-521-85653-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early literature was associated with [[colonialism]] and with observations by asylum psychiatrists or anthropologists who tended to assume the universal applicability of Western psychiatric diagnostic categories. A seminal paper by [[Arthur Kleinman]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(77)90138-X|author=Kleinman AM|title=Depression, somatization and the "new cross-cultural psychiatry"|journal=Soc Sci Med|volume=11|issue=1|pages=3–10|date=January 1977|pmid=887955}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a renewed dialogue between [[anthropology]] and psychiatry, is seen as having heralded a "new cross-cultural psychiatry". However, Kleinman later pointed out that culture often became incorporated in only superficial ways, and that for example 90% of DSM-IV categories are culture-bound to North America and Western Europe, and yet the "[[culture-bound syndrome]]" label is only applied to "exotic" conditions outside Euro-American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/10673229709030563|author=Kleinman A|title=Triumph or pyrrhic victory?

==Definition==
Cultural psychiatry looks at whether psychiatric classifications of disorders are appropriate to different cultures or ethnic groups. It often argues that psychiatric illnesses represent social constructs as well as genuine medical conditions, and as such have social uses peculiar to the social groups in which they are created and legitimized. It studies psychiatric classifications in different cultures, whether informal (e.g. category terms used in different languages) or formal (for example the World Health Organization's [[ICD]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], or the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]]'s [[CCMD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70238-0|author=Lee S|title=From diversity to unity.

The field has increasingly had to address the process of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1363461506061761|author=Kirmayer LJ|title=Beyond the 'new cross-cultural psychiatry': cultural biology, discursive psychology and the ironies of globalization|journal=Transcult Psychiatry|volume=43|issue=1|pages=126–44|date=March 2006|pmid=16671396 |url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said every city has a different culture and that the urban environment, and how people adapt or struggle to adapt to it, can play a crucial role in the onset or worsening of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70249-5|vauthors=Caracci G, Mezzich JE|title=Culture and urban mental health|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=24|issue=3|pages=581–93|date=September 2001|pmid=11593865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some scholars developing an anthropology of mental illness (Lézé, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;* Lézé, Samuel (2014) "[https://www.academia.edu/3581444/Anthropology_of_mental_illness Anthropology of mental illness]", in : Andrew Scull (ed.), ''Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide'', Sage, pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; consider that attention to culture is not enough if it is decontextualized from historical events, and history in more general sense. An historical and politically informed perspective can counteract some of the risks related to promoting universalized 'global mental health' programs as well as the increasing hegemony of diagnostic categories such as PTSD (Didier Fassin and Richard Rechtman analyze this issue in their book 'The Empire of Trauma').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fassin|first1=Didier|last2=Rechtman|first2=Richard|title=The Empire of Trauma: An Inquiry into the Condition of Victimhood|year=2009|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691137537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Beneduce, who devoted many years to research and clinical practice in West Africa (Mali, among the Dogon) and in Italy with migrants, strongly emphasizes this shift. Inspired by the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]], Beneduce points to forms of historical consciousness and selfhood as well as history-related suffering as central dimensions of a 'critical ethnopsychiatry' or 'critical transcultural psychiatry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneduce|first=Roberto|title=Etnopsichiatria.

==History==
As a named field within the larger discipline of psychiatry, cultural psychiatry has a relatively short history.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1955, a program in transcultural psychiatry was established at McGill University in Montreal by Eric Wittkower from psychiatry and Jacob Fried from the department of anthropology. In 1957, at the International Psychiatric Congress in Zurich, Wittkower organized a meeting that was attended by psychiatrists from 20 countries, including many who became major contributors to the field of cultural psychiatry: Tsung-Yi Lin (Taiwan), Thomas Lambo (Nigeria), Morris Carstairs (Britain), Carlos Alberto Seguin (Peru) and Pow-Meng Yap (Hong Kong). The American Psychiatric Association established a Committee on Transcultural Psychiatry in 1964, followed by the Canadian Psychiatric Association in 1967. H.B.M. Murphy of McGill founded the [[World Psychiatric Association Section on Transcultural Psychiatry]] in 1970. By the mid-1970s there were active transcultural psychiatry societies in England, France, Italy and Cuba. There are several scientific journals devoted to cross-cultural issues: ''[[Transcultural Psychiatry]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/|title=Transcultural Psychiatry: SAGE Journals|website=tps.sagepub.com|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (est. 1956, originally as ''Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review'', and now the official journal of the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry), ''Psychopathologie Africaine'' (1965), ''Culture Medicine &amp; Psychiatry'' (1977), ''Curare'' (1978), and ''World Cultural Psychiatry Research Review'' (2006). [[The Foundation for Psychocultural Research|The Foundation for Psychocultural Research at UCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefpr.org|title=FPR|website=FPR|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published an important volume on psychocultural aspects of trauma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521854288|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Barad, Mark|title=Understanding Trauma|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=0-5218-5428-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently the landmark volumes entitled ''Formative Experiences: the Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and Developmental Psychobiology'' edited by Carol Worthman, Paul Plotsky, Daniel Schechter and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895033|editor1=Worthman, Carol|editor2=Plotsky, Paul|editor3=Schechter, Daniel|editor4=Cummings, Constance|title=Formative Experiences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521854283}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Re-Visioning Psychiatry: Cultural Phenomenology, Critical Neuroscience, and Global Mental Health'' edited by Laurence J. Kirmayer, Robert Lemelson and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781316382813|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Cummings, Constance|title=Re-Visioning Psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781316382813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that a cultural perspective can help psychiatrists become aware of the hidden assumptions and limitations of current psychiatric theory and practice and can identify new approaches appropriate for treating the increasingly diverse populations seen in psychiatric services around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kirmayer LJ, Minas H|title=The future of cultural psychiatry: an international perspective|journal=Can J Psychiatry|volume=45|issue=5|pages=438–46|date=June 2000|pmid=10900523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent revision of the nosology of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], [[DSM-5]], includes a Cultural Formulation Interview that aims to help clinicians contextualize diagnostic assessment. A related approach to cultural assessment involves cultural consultation which works with interpreters and cultural brokers to develop a cultural formulation and treatment plan that can assist clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirmayer|first1=Laurence|last2=Guzder|first2=Jaswant|last3=Rousseau|first3=Cécile|title=Cultural Consultation: Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care|year=2014|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-7614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The main professional organizations devoted to the field are the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry, the [[Society for the Study of Psychiatry and Culture]], and the [[World Association for Cultural Psychiatry]]. Many other mental health organizations have interest groups or sections devoted to issues of culture and mental health.

There are active research and training programs in cultural psychiatry at several academic centers around the world, notably the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych|title=Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry|publisher=[[McGill University]]|website=www.mcgill.ca|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Toronto]], and [[University College London]]. Other organizations are devoted to cross-cultural adaptation of research and clinical methods. In 1993 the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) was founded. The TPO has developed a system of intervention aimed at countries with little or no mental health care. They train local people to become mental health workers, often using people who previously have provided mental health guidance of some kind. The TPO provides training material that is adapted to local culture, language and distinct traumatic events that might have occurred in the region where the organization is operating. Avoiding Western approaches to mental health, the TPO sets up what becomes a local non-governmental organization that is self-sustainable, as well as economically and politically independent of any state. The TPO projects have been successful in both Uganda and Cambodia.

The '''emulation theory of representation''' postulates that there are multiple internal modeling circuitries in the brain referred to as emulators. These emulators mimic the input-output patterns of many cognitive operations including action, perception, and imagery.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grush |first=R. |year=2004 |title=The emulation theory of representation: Motor control, imagery, and perception |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |pages=377–422 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickle"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=J. |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often running in parallel, these emulators provide resultant feedback in the form of mock sensory signals of a motor command with less delay than sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Desmurget |first1=M. |last2=Grafton |first2=S. |year=2000 |title=Forward modeling allows feedback control for fast reaching movements |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |pages=423–431 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01537-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forward models receive efference copies of input motor commands being sent to the body and the resulting output sensory signals. Emulators are continually updating so as to give the most accurate anticipatory signal following motor inputs.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

== Mechanics and structure ==
Little is known about the overall structure of emulators. It could operate like a search glossary with a very large associative memory of input-output sequences. Under this system, the emulator receives a motor command input, finds the closest matching input from its database, and then sends the associated output in that sequence. The other model is an articulated emulator. This model requires that for each significant sensor of the [[human musculoskeletal system]] there is a group of neurons with a parallel firing frequency within the emulator.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kawato |first1=M. |last2=Furukawa |first2=K. |last3=Suzuki |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=A Hierarchical Neural-Network Model for Control and Learning of Voluntary Movement |journal=Biological Cybernetics |volume=57 |pages=169–185 |doi=10.1007/bf00364149}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups of neurons would receive the same input as that being sent to their corresponding part of the musculoskeletal system. For example, when raising one’s hand signals will be sent to neurons responsible for wrist, elbow, and shoulder angles and arm angular inertia.

Regardless of this structure both systems will grow and change over time. This is due to constant, fluctuating noise from the environment and the fact that the body changes over time. Growing limbs and muscles result in changes in both required input commands and the resulting output. This requires a degree of plasticity in the emulators. Emulators are thus continually updating, always receiving the resulting output from the musculoskeletal system from an inputted command and comparing it to its own output. It is likely that this is accomplished through [[Kalman Filter]]. Complete correction from the difference in outputs, however, is not applied to the emulators.

[[File:Basic concept of Kalman filtering.svg|800x405px|thumbnail|center|Basic Concept of a Kalman Filter]]

Noise is a constant, fluctuating variable affecting musculoskeletal sensory output. Thus, output differences are almost always greater than they actually should be. Consequently, an internal calculation is made; taking into account the relative reliability of the emulator’s output and if the situational conditions tend to result in very variable or stable sensory outputs, the correction is weighted and applied.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The location of these emulators have been found to be largely dependent on the motor system they provide processing and information for.

== Cognitive function ==
Emulators are helpful tools to the body. Sensory feedback naturally takes longer than a predetermined forward model that the brain can compute or access directly. This timing gap can be delayed further by other environmental or physical factors that often occur throughout life. Emulators allow a mock output signal that is often close to that of the real thing. It is further postulated that the emulator can be run independently thus allowing the brain see the likely outcome of a command without running it on the entire system. Furthermore, when returning sensory information has noise and\or holes, the emulator can be run in parallel, making corrections and filling in gaps.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=John |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor control ===
Experiments have found that the temporal length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ito |first=M. |year=1984 |title=The cerebellum and neural control |location=New York, NY |publisher=Raven Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor centers, however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=van der Meulen |first1=J.H.P. |last2=Gooskens |first2=R.H.J.M. |last3=Dennier van der Gon |first3=J.J. |last4=Gielen |first4=C.C.A.M. |last5=Wilhelm |first5=K. |year=1990 |title=Mechanisms Underlying Accuracy in Fast Goal-Directed Arm Movements in Man |journal=Journal of Motor Behavior |volume=22 |number=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1080/00222895.1990.10735502}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. Motor centers often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators motor centers can receive fast and reliable feedback in the form of a priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Motor imagery ===
It is possible that emulators are largely responsible for [[motor imagery]]. By running motor areas offline, emulators can receive hypothetical movement commands and provide the imagined likely sensory results. Much of this may be run without conscious awareness. For instance, when walking towards an object on the ground to grab it, the brain is running offline motor plans to determine the optimal hand positioning and grip strength to pick up the object.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Visual system ===
Visual modal specific emulators have been experimentally shown to exist in an experiment by Ernst Mach in 1896. In his experiment, the subjects’ eyes were prevented from moving and then they were exposed to a stimulus that would trigger a saccade. Most subjects reported experiencing their entire visual scene briefly being shift in the opposite direction of the stimulus. Mach thus inferred that there is a mechanism within the visual system producing an a priori estimate of future visual scenes based upon motor commands and current visual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mach |first=E. |year=1896 |title=Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations |translator= C. M. WIlliams |location=La Salle |publisher=Open Court Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment on monkeys, this particular emulator was found to exist within a group of neurons within parietal cortex. Furthermore, it was discovered that these neurons began firing before the eye even moved. They only fired, however, if the motor command would result in a visual saccade. This suggests that visual emulators are modally specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Duhamel |first1=J. |last2=Colby |first2=C. |last3=Goldberg |first3=M. |year=1992 |title=The Updating of the Representation of Visual Space in Parietal Cortex by Intended Eye Movements |journal=Science |volume=255 |pages=90–92 |doi=10.1126/science.1553535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications for emulators ==
Emulators can be useful in a variety of industries and systems. Many factories and plants have central control systems that cannot afford to wait for certain information or updates. For example, control systems in chemical plants and reactors cannot wait for correctional signals from target systems to make alterations to chemical and material distribution and flow, thus accurate a priori predictions are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=A. |year=2003 |title=Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence |location=New York |publisher=Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics ===
Emulator-like programming has already been applied to many [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]. systems. In 1988 [[Bartlett Mel]] created a robot he named Murphy. Murphy was a robot arm with three joints and whose main objective was to reach out and grasp an object while avoiding contact with several objects in the way. The robot could operate under two modes. Under the first mode, Murphy would simply move its arm around the workspace until it found a path of unobstructed movement to the intended object. After enough of these runs, Murphy learns to associate a motor command with a future visual output. This leads to its second mode of operation. Similar to an emulator, Murphy can solve the navigation problem offline. Receiving visual imagery of the workspace, Murphy can manipulate an internal visual grid with [[efference copy|efference copies]]. Consequently, the robot can navigate through the obstacles and grasp the intended object in only one run.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The [[Mars landing]] rovers have to utilize a similar manipulation of input. [[NASA]] has to overcome an approximately twenty-minute time delay in information exchange from Earth and the rover on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Mission Timeline: Surface Operations |url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/tl_surface_nav.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disconnect from money ==

[[Consumerism]] features an increasingly cashless society with payment options including checks, credit cards, debit cards, money orders, small dollar loans and store-value cards, as well as various direct deposit methods for income and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Raghubir, P., &amp; Srivastava, J.

== Determinants of financial behavior ==

Individuals' financial behavior is influenced by many internal and external factors. Internal elements include individual [[psychology]], family history and environment&lt;ref&gt;Nyhus, E. K., &amp; Webley, P. (2001). The role of personality in household saving and borrowing behaviour. European Journal of Personality, 15, s85–s103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shim, S., Xiao, J.

Denver: National Endowment for Financial Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, self-worth, net worth and social signaling play a role on individuals' purchasing habits. 
People with limited funds, or those trying to keep up with another's lifestyle often suffer from low self-esteem. This results in feeling unworthy of a better financial future and behaving in self-sabotaging ways such as overspending on high-status items.&lt;ref&gt;Sivanathan, N., &amp; Pettit, N. C. (2010). Protecting the self through consumption: Status goods as affirmational

Improved financial circumstances require increased self-awareness because every financial decision is impacted by an individual's thoughts, feelings and attitudes about money which are often more unconscious than conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, L. (2009). Values centered financial education: Understanding cultural influences on learners' financial behaviors. Denver: National Endowment for Financial Education. Retrieved from http://www.smartaboutmoney.org/Portals/0/lifevalue/financialeducation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Social Work model incorporates the [[transformative learning]] approach to expand self-awareness, sense of self and provide financial knowledge. As individuals gain more insight into why and how their thoughts and attitudes about money developed, they are more likely to make deep, long-lasting financial choices that positively impact their future.&lt;ref&gt;Lusardi, A., Clark, R.

They then pursue their individual path to financial wellbeing according to where they are in the life cycle and their readiness/willingness to change, as per the [[Transtheoretical Model]] of Behavior Change (TTM).  In addition, ongoing education, motivation and support are provided as part of the Financial Social Work package, thereby maximizing the likelihood of the optimal results.&lt;ref&gt;Ozmete, E., &amp; Hira, T.

In [[computer science]], a '''first-time user experience (FTUE)''' refers to the initial stages of using a piece of software. Of particular importance are the configuration steps, such as signing up for an email account, or configuring a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]. Every user of a service has his/her own FTUE, even if he/she has extensive experience with using a similar product. Patience, time investment, and intuitiveness are factors for a user's FTUE. Software services generally have different layouts, styles, graphics, and hotkeys which must be identified to contribute to a user's learning, mastery, and efficiency of the software. The FTUE is responsible for setting the stage for the experience of the user when interacting with a product down the line. This differs from the [[out-of-box experience]] (OOBE), which is specifically about packaging, information presentation, and setup of the system out of the box.

== Relation to the cold start problem ==
FTUEs are directly related to the well-known [[Cold start (computing)|cold start problem]] in [[recommender systems]], which attempts to balance the ease of the initial experience with the difficulty of gathering the needed information to make quality recommendations to the user. Generally, an effort is made to increase user retention by minimizing the [[barriers to entry]] while maximizing the quality of the recommendations for the user. For example, it was found that by changing the FTUE task from rating 15 ''individual'' items to rating a smaller number of ''groups'' of items, the time taken to complete the initial task was reduced by more than 50% and user satisfaction with the resulting recommendations increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~schang/papers/coldstart15.pdf|title = Using Groups of Items for Preference Elicitation in Recommender Systems|last = Chang|date = 2015|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 22, 2015|last2 = Harper|last3 = Terveen|authorlink3=Loren Terveen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is evidence that steeper entry requirements can lead to more dedicated users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Aronson_Mills_1959_The_effect_of_severity_of_initiation.pdf|title = THE EFFECT OF SEVERITY OF INITIATION ON LIKING FOR A GROUP|last = Aronson|first = Elliot|date = 1959|journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/h0047195|pmid = |access-date = April 22, 2015|last2 = Mills|first2 = Judson|volume=59|issue = 2|pages=177–181|citeseerx = 10.1.1.368.1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a study at the [[University of Minnesota]], it was found that increasing the barriers to entry can increase the amount of [[user-generated content]] produced during the FTUE without sacrificing the quality of the content. Users subjected to a more difficult FTUE may also be more likely to produce more content in the future. This comes at a tradeoff, as the user attrition rate gradually increases with a higher barrier to entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.grouplens.org/papers/p187-drenner.pdf|title = Crafting The Initial User Experience to Achieve Community Goals|last = Drenner|first = Sara|date = 2008|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 22, 2015|last2 = Sen|first2 = Shilad|last3 = Terveen|first3 = Loren|authorlink3=Loren Terveen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this light, the idea of the FTUE becomes one of maximizing the benefit to the online community and the quality of the recommendations while minimizing the increase in the rate of user attrition.

== User retention ==

Preventing customers from abandoning software after the initial exposure is a goal of good FTUE design. The following are examples of efforts in user retention.

*''Speed vs Quality'': First impressions on the initial user interface (UI) of an interactive application depend on multiple factors; most notably speed and quality. Speed and quality are not necessarily inversely related, but if there is a limit on the amount of development hours available for a project, one of the two will generally suffer. Depending on the application, a sacrifice in either speed or quality must usually be made. Sacrifices in quality can include fewer luxury features, less intuitive/advanced UI features, or minimal customization. Sacrifices in speed can result in overall sluggish performance or delayed responsiveness when interacting with external clients or servers. Both are important to the "feel" of the application, and thus factor into the FTUE.
*''Negative first time user experiences:'' Negative FTUEs can severely impact user retention. Negative experiences can be related to over-complicated initial registration procedures. Requiring multiple stages of registration and email/phone verification can result in users abandoning the registration completely.&lt;ref name="intercom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munger|first1=Nate|title=Onboarding is Harder Than You Think|url=https://blog.intercom.io/strategies-for-onboarding-new-users/|website=intercom|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Social login]]:'' This allows users to create an account based on pre-obtained information from [[social networking]] profiles such as [[Facebook]]. Popular applications such as [[Spotify]], [[Quora]], [[Pinterest]] and more offer this method of registration. Up to 92% of people have reported leaving websites permanently instead of recovering lost login information; [[social login]] can help combat this by converting monthly unique users to monthly active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://janrain.com/resources/industry-research/2013-consumer-research-value-of-social-login/|website = Janrain|accessdate = 22 April 2015|title = 2013 Consumer Research: The Value of Social Login}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social login also allows access to the user's friends or contacts. This offers up more opportunity personalization and potential virality considering up to 78% of people claim to have visited a website after seeing it mentioned on their social network, and that they heavily weigh their friends recommendations for purchases of products mentioned via [[social media]]. {{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}
*''Structured setup:'' A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key for a successful FTUE. For example, [[Facebook]] registration clearly displays the number of steps remaining before the creation of a new profile is complete. This type of transparency is favorable because “uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.” The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Maister|first1 = David H.|journal = Columbia|url = http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/4615S13/Psychology_of_Waiting_Lines.pdf|accessdate = 22 April 2015|title = The Psychology of Waiting Lines}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Paid upgrades:'' Offering an opportunity to purchase an upgrade in the FTUE process can be advantageous considering that new users tend to be more motivated or enthusiastic. They will thereby be more likely to become paying customers instead of [[freemium]] users.&lt;ref name=intercom/&gt; After spending the time to install software and register, a user has shown at least moderate dedication to the technology and may be invested enough to pay for an upgrade they had not originally considered.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}} [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] does this by offering more storage for a dollar amount per month with a simple, non-invasive question. [[Vimeo]] offers a professional package, as is common with many online services.

==Prolonged user experience==

While desired early experiences commonly seem to relate to pleasant sensational aspects of software and product use, prolonged experiences are significantly more tied to aspects that reflect how the product may become meaningful in the user's life. Social products are not solely responsible for mediating goal achievement; they fulfill an inner need for personal growth and communicating messages about the user's self-identity in a social setting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/training/beforesept14/samwindows/pdf/belk-et-al-%281988%29-%27extended-self%27%281%29.pdf|title = Possessions and the Extended Self|last = Belk|first = Russell|date = 1988|journal = The Journal of Consumer Research |issue=2|doi = 10.1086/209154|pmid = |access-date = April 21, 2015|volume=15|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a user's familiarity with a product strengthens over time, it is expected that they would experience less frustration, as well as less excitement. As a result, the perceived quality of the product is expected to change, and therefore the relative importance of different qualities in the product can also change over time. It is widely accepted that learnability and novelty are critical during initial phases of product use, however, other aspects such as a product's [[social capital]] are likely to motivate prolonged use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&amp;context=hcii|title = Understanding Experience in Interactive Systems|last = Forlizzi|date = 2004|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 21, 2015|last2 = Battarbee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of a service or product's use is consistent of three main forces: ''familiarity'', ''functional dependency,'' and ''emotional attachment''. These three forces are responsible for shifting a users' experience across three phases: ''orientation'', ''incorporation'', and ''identification'', respectively. The incorporation factor is the most significant user experience phase of the three. Incorporation makes long-term usability become much more important than the initial learnability, and the product's usefulness becomes the main factor impacting the product's overall value in the eye of the user. As the user accepts the product into their lives, it participates in normal social interactions, and integrates with part of the users self-identity that connects to others and creates a sense of community, building identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ekarapanos.com/UXOT_CHI09.pdf|title = User Experience Over Time: An Initial Framework|last = Karapanos|date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 21, 2015|last2 = Zimmerman|last3 = Forlizzi|last4 = Martens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual experience with the product has been found to be more influential to users' satisfaction than their prior expectations, though the act of anticipation and creation of expectations is a crucial part of the primary [[user experience]]. Sometimes anticipating experiences with a product becomes even more important, emotional, and memorable than the experiences itself.

Effective and successful services and products are ''designed for daily rituals'' and ''designed for the self''. Users become attached to products that support a self-identity that they wish to communicate in certain settings. Products and self-identity have been a major part of consumer behavior research, but still remain largely unexplored in CHI and design research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{tone|date=March 2016}}
{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''Form of life''' ({{lang-de|Lebensform}}) is a technical term used by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and others in the [[continental philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science]] traditions. Wittgenstein himself used the term consistently in his works ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]'', but other writers have sometimes used it in very different and often mutually incompatible ways.

==Description==
Comments about a form of life are not explanations meant to comprehend the concept as a whole. The view that stringing together simple, non-controversial statements of ordinary understanding will illuminate something that is supposedly already understood is, in Wittgenstein's view, quite nonsensical. The concept of 'form of life' itself, for example, is extremely difficult to get right, as is indicated by the widely divergent things that have been said about it since Wittgenstein introduced it in the books cited above.

In response to a question from an imagined interlocutor, Wittgenstein notes the following:

: "So you are saying that human agreement decides what is false and what is true?" – It is what human beings ''say'' that is false and true; and they agree in the ''language'' they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. (Wittgenstein, ''Philosophical Investigations'', para. 241 [emphasis not in original])

Ordinarily, humans do not step away from their activities in order to justify how or why they say and do what they say and do. However, their activities, when investigated in an historical way, will be found to reflect a particular form of life.

When such questions do arise, a philosophical investigation will involve reminding the questioner of certain things he or she takes for granted and which, when noted, can help dissolve the question. We do what we do because we assume a given form of life, which gives our actions, ourselves, and the world meaning. Form of life is what makes meaning itself possible.

==Use by Agamben==
Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes up the intersecting concepts of form-of-life, rule-following and use, but besides attempting to deconstruct what Wittgenstein meant, traces these concepts genealogically, in the manner of Stirner or Rousseau. In ''The Highest Poverty – Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life'', Agamben looks at the emerging genre of written rules starting in the 9th century, and its development into both law and something beyond law in the Franciscan form-of-life, in which the Franciscans replaced the idea that we possess our life (or objects generally) with the concept of 'usus', that is 'use'. Agamben finds earlier versions of form-of-life in monastic rules, developing from 'vita vel regula', 'regula et vita', 'forma vivendi', and 'forma vitae'. Thus Agamben takes Wittgenstein's concepts and applies them to the history of Western monasticism in order to rethink the consequences of these concepts for doing (contemporary) politics — the main goal of his ''Homo Sacer''-project, which started with ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' and to which ''The Highest Poverty'' belongs.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used to model direct competition and [[trophic network|trophic relationships]] between an arbitrary number of species.  Their dynamics can be analysed analytically to some extent.  This makes them useful as a theoretical tool for modeling [[food web]]s.  However, they lack features of other ecological models such as [[predator preference]] and nonlinear [[functional response]]s, and they cannot be used to model mutualism without allowing indefinite population growth.

The generalised Lotka-Volterra equations model the dynamics of the populations &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; biological species.  Together, these populations can be considered as a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  They are a set of [[ordinary differential equation]]s given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_i f_i(\mathbf{x}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{r} + A\mathbf{x},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and A is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] known as the [[community matrix]].

==Meaning of parameters==

The generalised Lotka-Volterra equations can represent competition and predation, depending on the values of the parameters, as described below.  They are less suitable for describing mutualism.

The values of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; are the intrinsic birth or death rates of the species.  A positive value for &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; means that species i is able to reproduce in the absence of any other species (for instance, because it is a plant), whereas a negative value means that its population will decline unless the appropriate other species are present (e.g. a herbivore that cannot survive without plants to eat, or a predator that cannot persist without its prey).

The values of the matrix A represent the relationships between the species.  The value of &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the effect that species j has upon species i.  The effect is proportional to the populations of both species, as well as to the value of &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, if both &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; are negative then the two species are said to be in direct competition with one another, since they each have a direct negative effect on the other's population.  If &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt;a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; is negative then species i is considered to be a predator (or parasite) on species j, since i's population grows at j's expense.

Positive values for both &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; would be considered mutualism.  However, this is not often used in practice, because it can make it possible for both species' populations to grow indefinitely.

Indirect negative and positive effects are also possible.  For example, if two predators eat the same prey then they compete indirectly, even though they might not have a direct competition term in the community matrix.

The diagonal terms &lt;math&gt;a_{ii}&lt;/math&gt; are usually taken to be negative (i.e. species i's population has a negative effect on itself).  This self-limitation prevents populations from growing indefinitely.

==Dynamics and solutions==

The generalised Lotka-Volterra equations are capable of a wide variety of dynamics, including [[limit cycle]]s and [[Chaos theory|chaos]] as well as point attractors (see Hofbauer and Sigmund).  As with any set of ODEs, fixed points can be found by setting &lt;math&gt;dx_i/dt&lt;/math&gt; to 0 for all i, which gives, if no species is extinct, i.e., if  &lt;math&gt;x_i \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; i&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x} = -A^{-1}\mathbf{r}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This may or may not have positive values for all the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;; if it does not then there is no stable attractor for which the populations of all species are positive.  If there is a fixed point with all positive populations it may or may not be [[Lyapunov stability|stable]]; if it is unstable then there may or may not be a periodic or chaotic [[attractor]] for which all the populations remain positive.  In either case there can also be attractors for which some of the populations are zero and others are positive.  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=(0,0,\dots 0)&lt;/math&gt; is always a fixed point, corresponding to the absence of all species. For &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; species, a complete classification of this dynamics, for all sign patterns of above coefficients, is available,&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Bomze|Bomze, I.M.]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: a two-dimensional classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 48, 201–211 (1983); [[Immanuel Bomze|Bomze, I.M.]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 72, 447–453 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; which is based upon equivalence to the 3-type [[replicator equation]].

==Alternative views==

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator–prey model and their common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator–prey dynamics: ratio dependence].  ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012.

== 18th and 19th century  Ecological murmurs ==

===Arcadian and Imperial Ecology===

{{Main|Arcadian Ecology|}}
In the early Eighteenth century, preceding Carl Linnaeus, two rival schools of thought dominated the growing scientific discipline of ecology. First, [[Gilbert White]] a “parson-naturalist” is attributed with developing and endorsing the view of [[Arcadian Ecology|Arcadian ecology]]. Arcadian ecology advocates for a “simple, humble life for man” and a harmonious relationship with humans and nature.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Opposing the Arcadian view is Francis Bacon's ideology, “imperial ecology”. Imperialists work “to establish through the exercise of reason and by hard work, man’s dominance over nature”.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Imperial ecologists also believe that man should become a dominant figure over nature and all other organisms as “once enjoyed in the Garden of Eden”.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Both views continued their rivalry through the early eighteenth century until Carl Linnaeus's support of imperialism; and in short time due to Linnaeus's popularity, imperial ecology became the dominant view within the discipline.

===Carl Linnaeus and Systema Naturae===

{{Main|Carl Linnaeus|Systema Naturae|}}
Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist, is well known for his work with [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] but his ideas helped to lay the groundwork for modern ecology. He developed a two part naming system for classifying plants and animals. Binomial Nomenclature was used to classify, describe, and name different genera and species. The compiled editions of ''Systema Naturae'' developed and popularized the naming system for plants and animals in modern biology. Reid suggests "Linnaeus can fairly be regarded as the originator of systematic and ecological studies in biodiversity," due to his naming and classifying of thousands of plant and animal species. Linnaeus also influenced the foundations of Darwinian evolution, he believed that there could be change in or between different species within fixed genera. Linnaeus was also one of the first naturalists to place men in the same category as [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="Reid 18–31"/&gt;

===The botanical geography and Alexander von Humboldt===
Throughout the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Age of Sail|great maritime powers]] such as Britain, Spain, and Portugal launched many world exploratory expeditions to develop [[maritime commerce]] with other countries, and to discover new natural resources, as well as to catalog them.  At the beginning of the 18th century, about twenty thousand plant species were known, versus forty thousand at the beginning of the 19th century, and about [[The Plant List|300,000]] today.

These expeditions were joined by many [[scientist]]s, including [[botany|botanists]], such as the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].  Humboldt is often considered a father of ecology.  He was the first to take on the study of the relationship between organisms and their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].  He exposed the existing relationships between observed plant species and [[climate]], and described vegetation zones using [[latitude]] and [[altitude]], a discipline now known as [[geobotany]]. Von Humboldt was accompanied on his expedition by the botanist [[Aimé Bonpland]].

In 1856, the [[Park Grass Experiment]] was established at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] to test the effect of fertilizers and manures on hay yields. This is the longest-running field experiment in the world.&lt;ref name="open.ac.uk"/&gt;

===The notion of biocoenosis: Wallace and Möbius===
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]], contemporary and colleague of Darwin, was first to  propose a "geography" of animal species.  Several authors recognized at the time that species were not independent of each other, and grouped them into plant species, animal species, and later into communities of living beings or [[biocoenosis]].  The first use of this term is usually attributed to [[Karl Möbius]] in 1877, but already in 1825, the French naturalist [[Adolphe Dureau de la Malle]] used the term ''societé'' about an assemblage of plant individuals of different species.

===Warming and the foundation of ecology as discipline===
While [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] focused exclusively on [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as a selective force, [[Eugenius Warming|Eugen Warming]] devised a new discipline that took abiotic factors, that is drought, fire, salt, cold etc., as seriously as biotic factors in the assembly of biotic communities. [[Biogeography]] before Warming was largely of descriptive nature – faunistic or floristic. Warming's aim was, through the study of organism (plant) [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[anatomy]], i.e. adaptation, to explain why a species occurred under a certain set of environmental conditions. Moreover, the goal of the new discipline was to explain why species occupying similar habitats, experiencing similar hazards, would solve problems in similar ways, despite often being of widely different phylogenetic descent. Based on his personal observations in [[Brazil]]ian [[cerrado]], in [[Denmark]], Norwegian [[Finnmark]] and [[Greenland]], [[Eugenius Warming|Warming]] gave the first university course in ecological plant geography. Based on his lectures, he wrote the book  [[Eugenius Warming#'Plantesamfund' or 'Oecology of Plants'|‘Plantesamfund’]], which was immediate translated to German, [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], later to English as [[Eugenius Warming#'Plantesamfund' or 'Oecology of Plants'|‘Oecology of Plants’]]. Through its German edition, the book had an immense effect on British and North American scientists like [[Arthur Tansley]], [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] and [[Frederic Clements]].&lt;ref name="Coleman1986"&gt;

=== Malthusian influence ===

{{Main|Thomas Robert Malthus|}}
[[Thomas Robert Malthus]] was an influential writer on the subject of population and population limits in the early 19th century. His works were very important in shaping the ways in which Darwin saw the world worked. Malthus wrote:
{{quote|That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,

That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,

That the superior power of population is repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', in Oxford World's Classics reprint. p 61, end of Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[An Essay on the Principle of Population]] Malthus argues for the reining in of rising population through 2 checks: Positive and Preventive checks. The first raising death rates, the later lowers birthing rates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus also brings forth the idea that the world population will move past the sustainable number of people.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Chapter 1, p 13 in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of thought still continues to influences debates on birth and marriage rates to this theory brought forth by Malthus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; The essay had a major influence on Charles Darwin and helped him to theories his theory of Natural Selection.&lt;ref&gt;van Wyhe, John (2008b). Darwin: The Story of the Man and His Theories of Evolution. London: Andre Deutsch Ltd (published 1 September 2008). {{ISBN|0-233-00251-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle proposed by Malthusian thought not only influenced the ecological work of Charles Darwin, but helped bring about an economic theory of world of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin's Malthusian Metaphor and Russian Evolutionary Thought, 1859-1917Author, Daniel P. Todes, p. 537-540&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwinism and the science of ecology===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|[[Julia Margaret Cameron]]’s portrait of Darwin]]
It is often held that the roots of scientific ecology may be traced back to Darwin.&lt;ref name="Stauffer1957"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Stauffer |first1=R. C.
 |year=1957
 |title=Haeckel, Darwin and Ecology

 |doi=10.1086/401754
 |pmid=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contention may look convincing at first glance inasmuch as ''On the Origin of Species'' is full of observations and proposed mechanisms that clearly fit within the boundaries of modern ecology (e.g. the cat-to-clover chain – an ecological cascade) and because the term ecology was coined in 1866 by a strong proponent of Darwinism, [[Ernst Haeckel]]. However, Darwin never used the word in his writings after this year, not even in his most "ecological" writings such as the foreword to the English edition of [[Hermann Müller (botanist)|Hermann Müller]]’s ''The Fertilization of Flowers'' (1883) or in his own treatise of earthworms and mull formation in forest soils ([http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2355 The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms], 1881). Moreover, the pioneers founding ecology as a scientific discipline, such as [[Eugen Warming]], [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|A. F. W. Schimper]], [[Gaston Bonnier]], [[François-Alphonse Forel|F.A. Forel]], [[Stephen Alfred Forbes|S.A. Forbes]] and [[Karl Möbius]], made almost no reference to Darwin’s ideas in their works.&lt;ref name="Acot1997"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was clearly not out of ignorance or because the works of Darwin were not widespread.  Some such as S.A.Forbes studying intricate food webs asked questions as yet unanswered about the instability of food chains that might persist if dominant competitors were not adapted to have self-constraint.&lt;ref name="Forbes1887"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others focused on the dominant themes at the beginning, concern with the relationship between organism morphology and physiology on one side and environment on the other, mainly abiotic environment, hence environmental selection. Darwin’s concept of natural selection on the other hand focused primarily on competition.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms other than competition that he described, primarily the divergence of character which can reduce competition and his statement that "struggle" as he used it was metaphorical and thus included environmental selection, were given less emphasis in the Origin than competition.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite most portrayals of Darwin conveying him as a non-aggressive recluse who let others fight his battles, Darwin remained all his life a man nearly obsessed with the ideas of competition, struggle and conquest – with all forms of human contact as confrontation.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormandy78"/&gt;

== Early 20th century ~ Expansion of ecological thought ==

=== The biosphere – Eduard Suess and Vladimir Vernadsky ===
By the 19th century, ecology blossomed due to new discoveries in [[chemistry]] by [[Lavoisier]] and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|de Saussure]], notably the [[nitrogen cycle]].  After observing the fact that life developed only within strict limits of each compartment that makes up the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[lithosphere]], the Austrian geologist [[Eduard Suess]] proposed the term [[biosphere]] in 1875.  Suess proposed the name biosphere for the conditions promoting life, such as those found on [[Earth]], which includes [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[mineral]]s, [[Biogeochemical cycle|matter cycles]], et cetera.

In the 1920s [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]], a Russian geologist who had defected to France, detailed the idea of the biosphere in his work "The biosphere" (1926), and described the fundamental principles of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s.  He thus redefined the biosphere as the sum of all [[ecosystem]]s.

First ecological damages were reported in the 18th century, as the multiplication of colonies caused [[deforestation]].  Since the 19th century, with the [[industrial revolution]], more and more pressing concerns have grown about the impact of human activity on [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]].  The term [[ecologist]] has been in use since the end of the 19th century.

===The ecosystem: Arthur Tansley===
Over the 19th century, botanical geography and zoogeography combined to form the basis of [[biogeography]]. This science, which deals with habitats of species, seeks to explain the reasons for the presence of certain species in a given location.

It was in 1935 that [[Arthur Tansley]], the British [[ecologist]], coined the term [[ecosystem]], the interactive system established between the [[biocoenosis]] (the group of living creatures), and their [[biotope]], the environment in which they live.  Ecology thus became the science of ecosystems.

Tansley's concept of the ecosystem was adopted by the energetic and influential biology educator [[Eugene Odum]].  Along with his brother, [[Howard T. Odum]], Eugene P. Odum wrote a textbook which (starting in 1953) educated more than one generation of biologists and ecologists in North America.

===Ecological Succession – Henry Chandler Cowles===
[[File:Indiana dunes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan, which Cowles referred to in his development of his theories of ecological succession.]]
{{Main|Ecological succession|}}
At the turn of the 20th century, [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] was one of the founders of the emerging study of "dynamic ecology", through his study of [[ecological succession]] at the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|Indiana Dunes]], sand dunes at the southern end of [[Lake Michigan]].  Here Cowles found evidence of [[ecological succession]] in the [[vegetation]] and the [[soil]] with relation to age. [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Cowles]] was very much aware of the roots of the concept and of his (primordial) predecessors.&lt;ref name="The causes of vegetational cycles"/&gt; Thus, he attributes the first use of the word to the French naturalist [[Adolphe Dureau de la Malle]], who had described the vegetation development after forest clear-felling, and the first comprehensive study of successional processes to the [[Finland|Finnish]] botanist [[Ragnar Hult]] (1881).

===Animal Ecology - Charles Elton===

20th century English zoologist and ecologist, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]], is commonly credited as “the father of animal ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;Southwood, R.; Clarke, J. R. (1999). "Charles Sutherland Elton. 29 March 1900 -- 1 May: Elected F.R.S. 1953".&lt;/ref&gt; Elton influenced by Victor Shelford's ''Animal Communities in Temperate America'' began his research on animal ecology as an assistant to his colleague, Julian Huxley, on an ecological survey of the fauna in Spitsbergen in 1921. Elton's most famous studies were conducted during his time as a biological consultant to the Hudson Bay Company to help understand the fluctuations in the company's fur harvests. Elton studied the population fluctuations and dynamics of snowshoe hare, Canadian lynx, and other mammals of the region. Elton is also considered the first to coin the terms, food chain and food cycle in his famous book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C.S. 1968 reprint. Animal ecology. Great Britain: William Clowes and Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Elton is also attributed with contributing to disciplines of: invasion ecology, community ecology, and wildlife disease ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ken. 2011. Animal Ecology - Legacy of Charles S Elton.http://www.journalofanimalecology.org/view/0/virtualissuelegacyofcharlesselton.html ed.Journal of Animal Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===G. Evelyn Hutchinson - Father of Modern Ecology===
{{Main|G. Evelyn Hutchinson|}}

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|George “G” Evelyn Hutchinson]] was a 20th-century ecologist who is commonly recognized as the “Father of Modern Ecology”. Hutchinson is of English descent but spent most of professional career studying in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale University. Throughout his career, over six decades, Hutchinson contributed to the sciences of limnology, entomology, genetics, biogeochemistry, mathematical theory of population dynamics and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slobodkin | first1 = L.B. | year = 1993 | title = An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 390–394 | jstor=5370 | doi = 10.2307/5370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson is also attributed as being the first to infuse science with theory within the discipline of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, T. E. (2011). "George Evelyn Hutchinson. 13 January 1903 -- 17 May 1991". Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society 57: 167–177. {{DOI|10.1098/rsbm.2010.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson was also one of the first credited with combining ecology with mathematics. Another major contribution of Hutchinson was his development of the current definition of an organism's “niche” – as he recognized the role of an organism within its community. Finally, along with his great impact within the discipline of ecology throughout his professional years, Hutchinson also left a lasting impact in ecology through his many students he inspired.

== Ecological Influence on the Social Sciences and Humanities ==

===Human ecology===
{{Main|Human ecology}}
[[Human ecology]] began in the 1920s, through the study of changes in [[ecological succession|vegetation succession]] in the city of [[Chicago]].  It became a distinct field of study in the 1970s.  This marked the first recognition that humans, who had colonized all of the Earth's [[continent]]s, were a major [[ecological factor]].  Humans greatly modify the environment through the development of the habitat (in particular [[urban planning]]), by intensive exploitation activities such as [[logging]] and [[fishing]], and as side effects of [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[industry]]. Besides ecology and biology, this discipline involved many other natural and social sciences, such as [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], [[economics]], [[demography]], [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]], [[medicine]] and [[psychology]], and many more. The development of human ecology led to the increasing role of ecological science in the design and management of cities.

In recent years human ecology has been a topic that has interested organizational researchers. Hannan and Freeman (''Population Ecology of Organizations (1977)'', American Journal of Sociology) argue that organizations do not only adapt to an environment. Instead it is also the environment that selects or rejects populations of [[organizations]]. In any given environment (in [[Homeostasis#Ecological|equilibrium]]) there will only be one form of organization ([[isomorphism]]). [[Organizational ecology]] has been a prominent theory in accounting for diversities of organizations and their changing composition over time.

===James Lovelock and the Gaia hypothesis===
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia theory]], proposed by [[James Lovelock]], in his work ''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', advanced the view that the Earth should be regarded as a single living macro-organism.  In particular, it argued that the ensemble of living organisms has jointly evolved an ability to control the global environment — by influencing major physical parameters as the composition of the atmosphere, the evaporation rate, the chemistry of soils and oceans — so as to maintain conditions favorable to life. The idea has been supported by [[Lynn Margulis]] who extended her [[endosymbiotic theory]] which suggests that cell organelles originated from free living organisms to the idea that individual organisms of many species could be considered as symbionts within a larger metaphorical "super-organism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Ecosystems| year=1998| volume =1|issue=5|pages=431–436| title=Ecosystems and the Biosphere as Complex Adaptive Systems|first=Simon A.|last=Levin |doi=10.1007/s100219900037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision was largely a sign of the times, in particular the growing perception after the [[Second World War]] that human activities such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[industrialization]], [[pollution]], and [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resource]]s, fueled by [[exponential population growth]], were threatening to create catastrophes on a planetary scale, and has influenced many in the environmental movement since then.

===History and Relationship between Ecology and Conservation and Environmental movements===
[[environmentalism|Environmentalists]] and other [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] have used ecology and other sciences (e.g., [[climatology]]) to support their [[environmental movement|advocacy positions]]. Environmentalist views are often controversial for political or economic reasons. As a result, some scientific work in ecology directly influences policy and political debate; these in turn often direct ecological research.

The history of ecology, however, should not be conflated with that of environmental thought. Ecology as a modern science traces only from Darwin's publication of [[Origin of Species]] and Haeckel's subsequent naming of the science needed to study Darwin's theory. Awareness of humankind's effect on its environment has been traced to [[Gilbert White]] in 18th-century Selborne, England.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"/&gt; Awareness of nature and its interactions can be traced back even farther in time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esapubs.org"/&gt; Ecology before Darwin, however, is analogous to medicine prior to Pasteur's discovery of the infectious nature of disease. The history is there, but it is only partly relevant.

Neither [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] nor [[Haeckel]], it is true, did self-avowed ecological studies. The same can be said for researchers in a number of fields who contributed to ecological thought well into the 1940s without avowedly being ecologists.&lt;ref name="McIntosh1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

When the [[Ecological Society of America]] (ESA) was chartered in 1915, it already had a conservation perspective.&lt;ref name="Robert A. Coker 1991"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ecology had also been a visible part of the ESA at its inception, as evident by publications such as: "The Control of Pneumonia and Influenza by the Weather," "An Overlook of the Relations of Dust to Humanity," "The Ecological Relations of the Polar Eskimo," and "City Street Dust and Infectious Diseases," in early pages of Ecology and Ecological Monographs. The ESA's second president, Ellsworth Huntington, was a human ecologist. Stephen Forbes, another early president, called for "humanizing" ecology in 1921, since man was clearly the dominant species on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This auspicious start actually was the first of a series of fitful progressions and reversions by the new science with regard to conservation. Human ecology necessarily focused on man-influenced environments and their practical problems. Ecologists in general, however, were trying to establish ecology as a basic science, one with enough prestige to make inroads into Ivy League faculties. Disturbed environments, it was thought, would not reveal nature's secrets.

Interest in the environment created by the American Dust Bowl produced a flurry of calls in 1935 for ecology to take a look at practical issues. Pioneering ecologist C. C. Adams wanted to return human ecology to the science.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II, perhaps, caused the issue to be put aside.

The tension between pure ecology, seeking to understand and explain, and applied ecology, seeking to describe and repair, came to a head after World War II. Adams again tried to push the ESA into applied areas by having it raise an endowment to promote ecology. He predicted that "a great expansion of ecology" was imminent "because of its integrating tendency."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists, however, were sensitive to the perception that ecology was still not considered a rigorous, quantitative science. Those who pushed for applied studies and active involvement in conservation were once more discreetly rebuffed. Human ecology became subsumed by sociology. It was sociologist [[Lewis Mumford]] who brought the ideas of [[George Perkins Marsh]] to modern attention in the 1955 conference, "Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth." That prestigious conclave was dominated by social scientists. At it, ecology was accused of "lacking experimental methods" and neglecting "man as an ecological agent." One participant dismissed ecology as "archaic and sterile."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ESA, a frustrated Shelford started the Ecologists’ Union when his Committee on Preservation of Natural Conditions ceased to function due to the political infighting over the ESA stance on conservation.&lt;ref name="Robert A. Coker 1991"/&gt; In 1950, the fledgling organization was renamed and incorporated as the Nature Conservancy, a name borrowed from the British government agency for the same purpose.

Two events, however, brought ecology's course back to applied problems. One was the [[Manhattan Project]]. It had become the Nuclear Energy Commission after the war. It is now the Department of Energy (DOE). Its ample budget included studies of the impacts of nuclear weapon use and production. That brought ecology to the issue, and it made a "Big Science" of it.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem science, both basic and applied, began to compete with [[theoretical ecology]] (then called evolutionary ecology and also mathematical ecology). [[Eugene Odum]], who published a very popular ecology textbook in 1953, became the champion of the ecosystem. In his publications, Odum called for ecology to have an ecosystem and applied focus.&lt;ref&gt;

The second event was the publication of [[Silent Spring]]. Rachel Carson's book brought ecology as a word and concept to the public. Her influence was instant. A study committee, prodded by the publication of the book, reported to the ESA that their science was not ready to take on the responsibility being given to it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silent Spring was also the impetus for the environmental protection programs that were started in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and passed into law just before the first Earth Day. Ecologists’ input was welcomed. Former ESA President Stanley Cain, for example, was appointed an Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Interior.

The environmental assessment requirement of the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), "legitimized ecology," in the words of one environmental lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;

Not enough ecologists were available to work on impact assessment, outside of the DOE laboratories, leading to the rise of "instant ecologists,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atonforest.org/HBtoESA24Mar71.htm&lt;/ref&gt; having dubious credentials and capabilities.

The controversy, whose history has yet to receive adequate treatment, lasted through the 1970s and 1980s, ending with a voluntary certification process by the ESA, along with lobbying arm in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;

Post-Earth Day, besides questions of advocacy and professionalism, ecology also had to deal with questions having to do with its basic principles. Many of the theoretical principles and methods of both ecosystem science and evolutionary ecology began to show little value in environmental analysis and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;

Conservation for ecologists created travails paralleling those nuclear power gave former Manhattan Project scientists. In each case, science had to be reconciled with individual politics, religious beliefs, and worldviews, a difficult process. Some ecologists managed to keep their science separate from their advocacy; others unrepentantly became avowed environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;

===Roosevelt &amp; American Conservation===

Theodore Roosevelt was interested in nature from a young age. He carried his passion for nature into his political policies. Roosevelt felt it was necessary to preserve the resources of the nation and its environment. In 1902 he created the federal reclamation service, which reclaimed land for agriculture. He also created the Bureau of Forestry. This organization, headed by Gifford Pinchot, was formed to manage and maintain the nations timberlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt and the Environment|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tr-environment/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906. This act allowed for him to "declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be [[National Monument (United States)|National Monuments]]." Under this act he created up to 18 national monuments. During his presidency, Roosevelt established 51 Federal [[Bird reserve|Bird Reservations]], 4 National [[Game Preserves]], 150 [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s, and 5 [[National Parks]]. Overall he protected over 200 million acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt and conservation|url=http://www.nps.gov/thro/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecology and global policy===
Ecology became a central part of the World's politics as early as 1971, [[UNESCO]] launched a research program called ''[[Man and Biosphere]]'', with the objective of increasing knowledge about the mutual relationship between humans and nature.  A few years later it defined the concept of [[Biosphere Reserve]].

In 1972, the [[United Nations]] held the first international [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]], prepared by [[Rene Dubos]] and other experts.  This conference was the origin of the phrase "[[Think Globally, Act Locally]]".  The next major events in ecology were the development of the concept of biosphere and the appearance of terms "biological diversity"—or now more commonly [[biodiversity]]—in the 1980s.  These terms were developed during the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, where the concept of the biosphere was recognized by the major international organizations, and risks associated with reductions in biodiversity were publicly acknowledged.

Then, in 1997, the dangers the biosphere was facing were recognized all over the world at the conference  leading to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].  In particular, this conference highlighted the increasing dangers of the [[greenhouse effect]] – related to the increasing concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere, leading to [[Climate change|global changes in climate]]. In [[Kyoto]], most of the world's nations recognized the importance of looking at ecology from a global point of view, on a worldwide scale, and to take into account the impact of humans on the Earth's environment.

'''Institut Pasteur Korea''' is an infectious disease-focused research institute located in [[Gyeonggi Province]], Rep. of Korea. Its [http://www.pasteur.or.kr/profile/index.php?mNum=0&amp;c_seq=0 mission]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.or.kr/ Official website of Institut Pasteur Korea]. Retrieved 7 October 2010.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03Tba1Q?url=http://www.pasteur.or.kr/ |date=15 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to identify novel molecular targets and discover small molecules by utilizing its proprietary platforms to diagnose, treat and address serious unmet global public health needs.

It was inaugurated as a nonprofit private research institute on 12 April 2004&lt;ref&gt;“Conclusion on General Agreement for Establishment of Institut Pasteur Korea”
KIST Newsletter No. 294, January 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as a collaboration between the [[Institut Pasteur]] in Paris and [[Korea Institute of Science and Technology]] (KIST) in Seoul and it is supported by the Korean government through the [[Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning]]  (former Ministry of Science and Technology)&lt;ref name="Jae-Eun Lee 2004"&gt;Jae-Eun Lee, Gi-jung Chun, "The Key Success Factors of the Policy Implementation for the Government Innovation: Inducing Policy of the French Institute Pasteur", Korean Policy Sciences Review, Vol. 8, Nov.4 (December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and Gyeonggi Province.

Institut Pasteur Korea has been a key driver of early drug discovery among the 33 members of the Institut Pasteur International Network located in 26 countries on 5 continents, including China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Korea within Asia.

Institut Pasteur Korea provides fundamental technologies and tools to bridge between Korean and international bio-pharma science. For more than a decade, it has integrated [[biology]], [[IT]] and [[chemistry]] to develop innovative imaging technologies for [[high-throughput screening]]; resulting in discovery of a new best-in-class molecule to fight [[tuberculosis]] (TB). Institut Pasteur Korea is also focused on discovery biology to study and understand TB and on the development of new and more effective ways to diagnose and treat the disease. Leveraging its unique drug discovery capabilities and global partnerships, Institut Pasteur Korea also tackles antibacterial resistance, [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]], [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], [[influenza]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[dengue fever]] and [[cancer]].

The Institute is housed in a purpose-built facility in the city of [[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]] in Gyeonggi Province, 20&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Seoul]].

==Origins==

Institut Pasteur Korea was established by collaboration between [[Institut Pasteur]]  and [[Korea Institute of Science and Technology|KIST]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/03_IPKorea_E.html Creation of the Institut Pasteur of Korea]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03UfCJe?url=http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/03_IPKorea_E.html |date=December 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institut Pasteur is a private foundation dedicated to the study of biology, [[microorganisms]], diseases and vaccines. It is named after [[Louis Pasteur]], its founder and first director, who successfully developed the first anti-rabies serum in 1885. KIST, founded in 1966, was the first multi-disciplinary scientific research institute in Korea and has contributed significantly to the economic development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Moo-Young Han, "Annotated Chronology of Korea's Science and Technology: From Rice Paddies to Flat Panel Displays" {{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/~myhan/kaf0401.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v03VQJHW?url=http://www.duke.edu/~myhan/kaf0401.html |archivedate=December 15, 2010 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, two major agreements between Institut Pasteur Paris and KIST paved the way for the launch of Institut Pasteur Korea. One established financial arrangements for the operation of the institute; the other was a general agreement on its foundation and management. Institut Pasteur Korea was mandated to expand the reach of Institut Pasteur by moving [[basic research]] toward [[therapy]] development and to introduce the “Pasteurian” research mission, management and culture to Korea.&lt;ref name="Jae-Eun Lee 2004"/&gt; Over its 130-year history, the Institut Pasteur in Paris has combined scientific achievements with their application in public health.

Institut Pasteur Korea was inaugurated in April 2004. Operations began at the start of 2005 under the motto “From Drug to Genes”, with the mission of turning basic research into pharmaceuticals using “target-free” drug discovery. Using this approach, drugs are sought in a cellular context, with no preconceived notions of what targets within the cell are relevant.

Institut Pasteur Korea joined the [http://www.web.pasteur.fr/ip/easysite/pasteur-international-en/institut-pasteur-international-network/the-network Institut Pasteur International Network] in November 2004 as a private foundation recognized as working toward the public good through biomedical research.

Until April 2009 Institut Pasteur Korea was located in a small facility on the campus of KIST. It then moved into a new 15,199 square meter facility in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province.  The institute is one of the few in the world that contains robotic, high throughput optical imaging capacity within [[biosafety level]] 2 and 3 facilities.

==Vision and Strategy==

With the excellence of its multinational scientists and staff, the cutting-edge translational-driven research innovations, the strong affiliation with Institut Pasteur Paris and its global network of 33 institutes, and the commitment to making a difference in people's lives according to the teachings of Dr. Louis Pasteur, Institut Pasteur Korea aims to be one of the premier research institutions in Korea.

Institut Pasteur Korea focuses on five key objectives to accelerate the discovery phase for a multitude of infectious diseases:

1) Build a fundamental understanding of the biology of the disease.

2) Deploy discovery platforms to search for novel host molecular target(s) for intervention and diagnosis; and identify novel compounds to treat the disease.

3) Facilitate the transition from discovery to translation through chemistry optimization and asset valorization efforts.

4) Identify the right industrial partner for further development and commercialization of diagnostic kits for earlier detection and prevention; and novel small molecule therapies for immediate treatment and disease spread control.

5) Develop and mentor the research leaders of tomorrow through targeted recruitment and retention of rising stars, combined with academic outreach programs, such as Pasteur Jr. and Institut Pasteur Korea Life Science programs.

==Organization==

Institut Pasteur Korea is organized into four divisions, Research Technology Management, Discovery Biology, Discovery Chemistry and Administration. These functional units collaborate across disciplines and classical research boundaries, providing an effective operational organization to meet the strategic goals of the institute.

==Research and Technology==

Institut Pasteur Korea’s research groups study infectious diseases including [[tuberculosis]], antibacterial resistance, [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]], [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], [[influenza]], [[leishmaniasis]], and [[dengue fever]], as well as [[cancer]].

For over a decade, Institut Pasteur Korea has focused on technology development to build the best drug discovery platform for high-content screening performed in BSL level 2 and 3 environments. Its innovative screening platform utilizes target-free, visual high-content screening using large compound libraries or siRNA libraries to identify chemical compounds that prevent or slow disease progression in live, physiologically relevant disease models. Its core technology features automated cellular imaging-based, high-content screening facilities with a capacity to screen up to 2 million points (independent compounds or [[RNAi]]) per year.

Institut Pasteur Korea’s target identification technology uses high-content, genome-wide visual arrays to identify targets of interest in live cellular disease models. By screening with siRNA libraries, researchers can identify genes that alter drug sensitivity in the cellular disease model, thereby providing a way to quickly close in on the molecular targets.

Institut Pasteur Korea’s Discovery Chemistry group applies new concepts of drug design to optimize hit-to-lead identification. Its drug discovery technology platforms have led to the first-ever TB chemical screen performed using primary macrophages and resulting in a new best-in-class molecule to fight TB, referred to as Q203.

==Business Development==

Institut Pasteur Korea actively promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration with international and domestic scientific communities and it is committed to sharing the fruits of our research, technologies and expertise with partners and young scientists.

The positive reputation of Institut Pasteur Korea and its technology in the international pharmaceutical community has led to collaborations with multiple global partners. Also of significance, Institut Pasteur Korea entered the Korean market by establishing a privileged partnership with major pharmaceuticals. The formation of these collaborations is an important milestone for the development of further business relationships in the pharmaceutical arena.

Additionally, [http://www.qurient.com, Qurient, Co. Ltd.] is a spinoff company that serves as a virtual drug development center, using [[contract research organization]]s to bring small molecules generated by Institut Pasteur Korea into [[clinical trials]]. The goal of Qurient is to license out lead compounds discovered at Institut Pasteur Korea for clinical development and commercialization by larger partners in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sector.

==Financial Support==

Institut Pasteur Korea is funded through Korean government subsidies from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and Gyeonggi Province, domestic and international grants, revenues from industry sponsored research and license agreements, and donations.

[[Image:Front Entrance to ISAS.jpeg|200px|thumb|Entrance to the ISAS [[Sagamihara Campus]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'''|宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}} (ISAS) is a [[Japan]]ese national research organization of [[astrophysics]] using [[rocket]]s, [[astronomy|astronomical]] satellites and [[interplanetary probe]]s which played a major role in [[Japan's space development]].  Since 2003, it is a division of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAXA History|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/about/history/index_e.html|publisher=JAXA Official Website (English)|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISAS originated as part of the [[Institute of Industrial Science]] of the [[University of Tokyo]], where [[Hideo Itokawa]] experimented with miniature [[solid-fuel rocket]]s ([[Pencil Rocket]] and [[Baby Rocket]]) in the 1950s.  This experimentation eventually led to the development of the [[Kappa_(rocket)|Κ (''Kappa'')]] [[sounding rocket]], which was used for observations during the [[International Geophysical Year]].  By 1960, the Κ-8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km.

In 1964, the rocket group and the ''Institute of Aeronautics'', along with [[high altitude balloon|scientific ballooning]] team&lt;!--from Kobe Univ?--&gt;, were merged to form {{nihongo|''Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science''|宇宙航空研究所|Uchū kōkū kenkyūjo}} within the University of Tokyo.  The rocket evolved into the [[Lambda (rocket)|L (''Lambda'')]] series, and, in 1970, L-4S-5 was launched as Japan's first artificial satellite [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]].

Although ''Lambda'' rockets were only sounding rockets, the next generation of [[Mu (rocket family)|M (''Mu'') rocket]]s was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start.  Beginning in 1971, ISAS launched a series of [[scientific satellites]] to observe the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].  Since the launch of [[Hakucho]] in 1979, ISAS has had [[X-ray astronomy]] satellites consecutively in orbit, until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of [[ASTRO-E]].

In 1981, as a part of university system reform, and for the mission expansion, ISAS was spun out from University of Tokyo as an inter-university national research organization, ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science''.

In 2003, three national aerospace organizations including ISAS were merged to form [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).  The English name ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'' is still used, although the Japanese name was changed to 宇宙科学研究本部, (literally, ''Space Science Research Division'', whereas the previous name's literal translation was ''Space Science Laboratory'').  In 2010, the name was changed back to the previous {{nihongo||宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}}.

'''International Winter University (IWU) Kassel''' is a short-term program that is held during the winter season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. The IWU inspired from the international short-term programs held in Germany, then [[International Summer University (ISU) Kassel]] began the establishment of IWU in response to growing interest of international students to study in Germany. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Uni Kassel organizes both of ISU and IWU as one of its internationalization strategies. The program of IWU Kassel is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971.

The uniqueness of IWU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and cultural heritage. While IWU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program has been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, IWU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and Development of the Programme==
Following the success of ISU, the International Winter University (IWU) was established in 2005/06 to offer international students an alternative time frame to experience [[education in Germany]]. It is a pioneer of short-term winter programs in Germany and is one of the short-term programs bearing the DAAD&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.germany.daad.org/ DAAD] page.&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Seal.

Besides, IWU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of Uni Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, IWU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to IWU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, IWU has received on average some 50 international students each year. The number of students is on the rise with its growing popularity among partnering universities. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries. 

==Program of Study==
The study program of IWU Kassel includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in '''teaching German as a foreign language'''. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for engineering module usually cover the following topics: an introduction to international climate policy, renewable energy and energy systems from a German and European perspective, environment protection measures, solar-thermal technologies and systems, [[photovoltaic]], the history and future of wind energy, [[wind farm management]], [[biomass]], [[natural gas storage]], and rational and efficient energy usage: low energy housing and sustainable building. Seminar for German culture module usually covers topics such as German history, literature, and art of the 19th and 20th centuries, which all activities will explore how contemporary German culture has been shaped by historical developments in the past 200 years, the "Age of Goethe" (Goethe-Zeit), the end of the 19th century ([[nietzsche]]), and the [[revolutionary]] [[art movement]] ([[bauhaus]] and [[expressionism]]).

Students will be awarded 6 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [https://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


Kassel is a mid-sized city located in northern Hesse in the centre of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000 which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interpersonal communication''' is an exchange of information between two or more people.&lt;ref name="berger_iec_2008"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-1-4051-3199-5| pages = 3671–3682| editor = Wolfgang Donsbach| last = Berger| first = Charles R.| title = Interpersonal communication| encyclopedia = The International Encyclopedia of Communication| location = New York, New York| date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an area of study and research that seeks to understand how humans use verbal and nonverbal cues to accomplish a number of personal and relational goals.&lt;ref name="berger_iec_2008" /&gt; Generally, interpersonal communication research has contributed to at least six distinct categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adjust and adapt their [[verbal communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]] during [[face-to-face communication]], 2) the processes of message production, 3) how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) [[Interpersonal deception theory|deceptive communication]], 5) [[relational dialectics]], and 6) social interaction that is [[Computer-mediated communication|mediated by technology]].&lt;ref name="berger_joc_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x| issn = 1460-2466| volume = 55| issue = 3| pages = 415–447| last = Berger| first = Charles R.| title = Interpersonal communication: Theoretical perspectives, future prospects| journal = Journal of Communication| accessdate = 2017-11-04| date = 2005-09-01| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of scholars collectively identify with and use the term interpersonal communication to describe their own work. These scholars, however, also recognize that there is considerable variety in how they and their colleagues conceptually and operationally define this area of study. In some regards, the construct of interpersonal communication is like the phenomena it represents- that is, it is dynamic and changing. Thus, attempts to identify exactly what interpersonal communication is or is not are often frustrating and fall short of consensus.&lt;ref name="Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011"&gt;Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many who research and theorize about interpersonal communication do so from across many different research paradigms and theoretical traditions.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manning | first1 = J. | year = 2014 | title = A Constitutive Approach to Interpersonal Communication Studies | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10510974.2014.927294#abstract | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 432–440 | doi = 10.1080/10510974.2014.927294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are many definitions available, interpersonal communication is often defined as the communication that takes place between people who are interdependent and have some knowledge of each other. Interpersonal communication includes what takes place between a son and his father, an employer and an employee, two sisters, a teacher and a student, two lovers, two friends, and so on. Although largely dyadic in nature, interpersonal communication is often extended to include small intimate groups such as the family. Interpersonal communication can take place in face-to-face settings, as well as through media platforms, such as social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpersonal Messages|chapter=Foundations of interpersonal communication (from Part I: Preliminaries to Interpersonal Messages)|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205943608.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807092332/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205943608.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2015|deadurl=yes|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of interpersonal communication looks at a variety of elements that contribute to the interpersonal communication experience. Both quantitative/social scientific methods and qualitative methods are used to explore interpersonal communication. Additionally, a biological and physiological perspective on interpersonal communication is a growing field. Within the study of interpersonal communication, some of the concepts explored include the following: personality, knowledge structures and social interaction, language, nonverbal signals, emotion experience and expression, supportive communication, social networks and the life of relationships, influence, conflict, computer-mediated communication, interpersonal skills, interpersonal communication in the workplace, intercultural perspectives on interpersonal communication, escalation and de-escalation of romantic or platonic relationships, interpersonal communication and healthcare, family relationships, and communication across the life span.&lt;ref name="Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011"/&gt;

==Role==
The role of interpersonal communication has been studied as a mediator for mass media effects. Since Katz and introduced their ‘filter hypothesis’, maintaining that personal communication mediates the influence of mass communication on individual voters, many studies have repeated this logic when combining personal and mass communication in effect studies on election campaigns (Schmitt-Beck, 2003). Although some research exists that examines the activities of social networking and the potential effects, both positive and negative, on its users, there is a gap in the empirical literature. Social networking relies on technology and is conducted over specific devices with no presence of face-to-face interaction, which results in an inability to access interpersonal behavior and signals to facilitate communication. (Drussel, 2012) As many positive advances we’ve seen come from the latest web innovations, can it be said that there are negative ones as well? Interpersonal communication is defined as what one uses with both spoken and written words as the basis to form and maintain personal relationships with others (Heil 2010). As technological advancements are made, the residual impact of social networking on society's young generation is of valuable importance to researchers in the social work field. Left unattended, the lack of skills to effectively communicate and resolve conflicts in person may negatively affect behavior and impair the ability to develop and maintain relationships. (Drussel,2012)

Technological side effects may not always be apparent to the individual user and, combined with millions of other users, may have large-scale implications. Therefore, each participant has a dual role—as an individual who may be affected by the social environment and as a participant who is interacting with others and co-constructing the same environment (Greenfield &amp; Yan, 2006).  Berson, Berson and Ferron (2002) believe that benefits of online interaction included learning relational skills, expressing thoughts and feelings in a healthy way, and practicing critical thinking skills.  However, there are some problems with this because one important negative point of interpersonal communication through social network is that people who rely on social networking lose their ability to communicate with others face-to-face. On the other hand, positive and negative effects of using interpersonal communication vary and depends on individual point of view.  In which case, it makes it challenging to give this question a specific answer.

== Context ==
Context generally refers to the environmental factors that influence the outcomes of communication. This includes the time and place as well as the background of the participants.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"&gt;Corbin, C. White, D. (2008). "Interpersonal Communication: A Cultural Approach." Sydney, NS. Cape Breton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In any given environment/situation a conversation takes place in, many contexts may be interacting at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHugh Schuste|first1=Pamela|title=Communication for Nursing: How to Prevent Harmful Events and Promote Patient Safety|date=2010|publisher=F. A. Davis Company|location=USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=communication+context+includes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mNXXrV05tQ&amp;sig=ZYceN4YJIrV9KOetfyBr_5UdWSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uYw0VN6lNNH_yQSxsoKYBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20context%20includes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have an in-depth understanding of the interpersonal interaction, the retrospective context and the emergent context must be examined and considered.  The retrospective context is defined as everything that comes before a particular behavior that might help understand and interpret that behaviour. The emergent context is described as all events that come after the said behavior and which may also contribute to understanding the behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Mark L.|last2=Daly|first2=John A.|title=Handbook of interpersonal communication|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publ.|location=Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.]|isbn=0-7619-2160-5|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Context in regards to interpersonal communication refers to the establishment and control of formal and informal relationships.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ackerson | first1 = L. | last2 = Viswanath | first2 = K. | year = 2009 | title = The Social Context Of Interpersonal Communication And Health | url = | journal = Journal of Health Communication | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 517–517 | doi = 10.1080/10810730902806836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the focus has been on "[[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] communication" meaning face to face mutual ideas between two individuals in health communication research with a focus on the patient and the provider.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Additionally, interest in the role of families, and occasionally among other key roles in the health care system are all factors on the context of interpersonal communication. Context can include all aspects of social channels and situational milieu.

=== Situational milieu ===

Situational [[Social environment|milieu]] can be defined as the combination of the social and physical environments in which something takes place. For example, a classroom, a military conflict, a supermarket checkout, and a hospital would be considered situational milieus. Similarly, this includes the season, weather, current physical location and environment.

In order to understand the meaning of what is being communicated, context must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knapp |first1= M.L. |last2=Daly |first2=J.A. |last3=Albada |first3=K.F. |last4=Miller |first4=G.R. |title= Handbook of interpersonal communication |date=2002 |publisher= Sage Publ. |location= Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.] |isbn= 0-7619-2160-5 |pages=2–21|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hospital context, internal and external noise can have a profound effect on interpersonal communication.  External noise consists of influences around the recetion that distract from the communication itself.&lt;ref name="Adler, R.B. 2012"&gt;Adler, R.B., Rosenfeld, L.B., Proctor II, R.F., Winder, C. (2012). ocess of Interpersonal Communication''. Don Mills: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In hospitals, this can often include the sound made by medical equipment or conversations had by team members outside of patient's rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Costa |first1= G.L. |last2= Lacerda |first2= A.B. |last3= Marques |first3= J. |year= 2013 |title= Noise on the hospital setting: impact on nursing professionals' health |url= |journal= EFAC |volume= 15 |issue=3 |pages= 642–652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal noise is described as [[cognitive]] causes of interference in a communication transaction.&lt;ref name="Adler, R.B. 2012"/&gt; Internal noise in the hospital setting could be health care professionals' own thoughts distracting them from a present conversation with a client.

Channels of communication also contribute to the effectiveness of interpersonal communication. A communication channel can be defined as the medium through which a message is transmitted. There are two distinct types of communication channels: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous channels involve communica are present. Examples of synchronous channels include face-to-face co chats, and telephone conversations. Asynchronous communication can be sent and received at different points in time. Examples of this type of channel are text serve as reminders of what has been done and what needs to be done, which can prove to beneficial in a fast-paced health care setting. Some of the disadvantages associated with communication through asynchronous channels are that the sender does not know when the other person will receive the message. Mix-ups and errors can easily occur when clarification is not readily available. On the other hand, when an urgent situation arises, as they commonly do in a hospital environment, communication through synchronous channels is ideal. Benefits of synchronous communication include immediate message delivery, and fewer chances of misunderstandings and miscommunications. A disadvantages of synchronous communication is that it can be difficult to retain, recall, and organize the information that has been given in a verbal message. This is especially true when copious amounts of data has been communicated in a short amount of time. When used appropriately, synchronous and asynchronous communication channels are both efficient ways to communicate and are vital to the functioning of hospitals.&lt;ref name="Parker 2000 453–461"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Julie|last2=Coiera|first2=Enrico|date=2000|title=Improving Clinical Communication A View From Psychology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|publisher=American Medical Informatics Association|volume=7|issue=5 |pages=453–461|doi=10.1136/jamia.2000.0070453|pmc=79040|pmid=10984464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When mistakes occur in hospitals, more often than not, they are a result of communication problems rather than just errors in judgment or negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=T.L.|last2=Parrott|first2=R.|title=Handbook of interpersonal communication|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publ.|location=Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.]|isbn=0-7619-2160-5|pages=680–725|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when there is a lack of understanding and cooperation, due to a breakdown in communication in the hospital milieu, it is the patient who suffers the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kron|first1=Thora|title=Communication in nursing|date=1972|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7216-5521-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is essential to cultivate an environment conducive to effective communication, through appropriate use of communication channels, as well as the elimination, when possible, of distracting internal and external noise.

=== Cultural and linguistic backgrounds ===

[[Linguistics]] is primarily the study of language that is divided into three broad aspects including the form of language, the meaning of language, and the context or function of language. The first aspect, form is based on the words and sounds of language and uses the words to make sentences that make sense. The second aspect, meaning, focuses on the meaning and significance of the words and sentences that human beings have put together. The third aspect, function, or context is based on recognizing the meaning of the words and sentences being said and using them to understand why a person is communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, L. Goodman, J.E. (2007). ''A Cultural Approach to Interpersonal Communication''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] is a human made concept that helps to define the beliefs, values, attitudes, and customs of a group of people that have similarities to one another in relation to language and location that have helped the people to survive more throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Samovar, L.A. Porter, R.E. McDaniel, E.R. (2009). ''Communication Between Cultures''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two subcultures, which include high-culture and low-culture. [[High culture|High-culture]] is seen as the part of culture that includes a set of cultural aspects mainly focusing on the arts, such as music, drama and others. Those that are of higher esteem and can access these aspects mostly are a part of this. [[Low culture|Low-culture]] in contrast, has a massive audience and is a term more for popular culture.

Culture has a strong dependence on communication because of the help it provides in the process of exchanging information in the objective to transmit ideas, feelings, and specific situations present in the person's mind.&lt;ref name="Fleischer, S. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleischer | first1 = S. | last2 = Berg | first2 = A. | last3 = Zimmermann | first3 = M. | last4 = Wüste | first4 = K. | last5 = Behrens | first5 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Nurse-patient interaction and communication: A systematic literature review | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 339–353 | doi = 10.1007/s10389-008-0238-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture influences our thoughts, feelings and actions, and when communication is occurring there should be an awareness of this.&lt;ref&gt;Intercultural communication: A contextual approach (4th ed.). Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; This means the more different an individuals cultural background is, the more different their styles of communication will be.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; Therefore, the first step before communicating with individuals of other cultures is the importance of being aware of a persons background, ideas and beliefs before there is interpretation of their behaviours in relation to communication. It is stressed that there is an importance of cultural safety which is the recognition of social, economic and political positions of individuals before beginning communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourque Bearskin | first1 = R. L. | year = 2011 | title = A critical lens on culture in nursing practice | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 548–559 | doi = 10.1177/0969733011408048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 5 major elements related to culture that affect the communication process:&lt;ref name="Samovar, L. A. 2010"&gt;Samovar, L. A., Porter, R. E., &amp; McDaniel, E. R. (2010). Communication between cultures. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, c2010&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                                                                             [[File:Communication Diagram.png|thumb|This is a Communication Diagram showing the two different types of communication that can be done between cultures. It is then further broken down into how you appropriately communicate verbally or non verbally with individuals of different cultures.]]

#[[Cultural history]]
#[[Religion]]
#[[Value (personal and cultural)]]
#[[Social organization]]
#[[Language]]

After the initial understanding of culture then communication takes place. Communication between cultures can be done through [[Verbal communication]] or [[Nonverbal communication]] with a sender and a receiver present. There is emphasis on acknowledgement and understanding of values, beliefs, emotions and behaviours of culturally competent individuals so you are able to adapt and decode the message and respond appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. S. | year = 2014 | title = Reaching for cultural competence | url = | journal = Plastic Surgical Nursing | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 120–126 | doi = 10.1097/PSN.0000000000000059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influences in Verbal Communication'''

Culture has influenced [[Verbal communication]] in a variety of ways. [[Linguistics]] is a large factor in relation to this because different cultures have different language barriers.&lt;ref name="Muñoz, C. C. 2005"&gt;Muñoz, C. C., &amp; Luckmann, J. (2005). Transcultural communication in nursing. Clifton Park, NY : Thomson/Delmar Learning, c2005&lt;/ref&gt; When communicating verbally with individuals of different cultures it is important to respond appropriately and withhold any judgment.  If there is a [[language barrier]] between the sender and receiver attempt to seek clarification, do not try not to interpret the meanings of the message.&lt;ref name="Muñoz, C. C. 2005"/&gt; There must be sensitivity present for individuals who are expressing opinions on culture and language. We live in a multicultural time, and this plays an important factor in considering that each individual has their own languages, beliefs and values that are allowed to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; When a verbal response is cultivated, it must be sensitive to another individuals culture.&lt;ref&gt;Neuliep, J. (2009). Intercultural communication: A contextual approach (4th ed.). Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influences in Nonverbal Communication'''

Culture has an influence on our [[Nonverbal communication]] in a variety of different factors. For example, in some cultures eye contact is not essential, therefore those who do use eye contact may find it hard to talk or listen to someone who is not looking at them.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; Another example is touching as a form of greeting may be perceived as impolite to some cultures whereas it is seen as a norm to others.&lt;ref name="Samovar, L. A. 2010"/&gt; It is important to acknowledge these cultural differences, and be understanding of them so better non verbal communication can be established.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, C. C., &amp; Luckmann, J. (2005). Transcultural communication in nursing. Clifton Park, NY : Thomson/Delmar Learning, c2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is that culture has a strong process of dependence on communication in the professional field.&lt;ref name="Fleischer, S. 2009"/&gt; Therefore, communication constitutes an important part of the quality of care and predominantly influences client and resident satisfaction; it is a core element of care and is a fundamentally required skill. Still, language can be expressed in different aspects although the most common process is the verbal and nonverbal communication. Hence, body language does a key factor in the process to communicate and interact which other. For example, the nurse-patient relationship is primarily mediated by verbal and nonverbal communication, so both aspects need to be understood.

=== Developmental Progress (maturity) ===

[[File:Constituents of Communication.png|thumb|This pie chart shows that 80% of communication is non-verbal and 20% of communication is verbal. This demonstrates how important non-verbal communication is in infants.]]
[[File:Stages of Development in Interpersonal Communication.png|thumb|This pyramid demonstrates the relationship between interpersonal communication and the stages of development. The downward formation of the triangle represents how much language is developed during that growth stage. The greatest amount of development occurs in the stage of infancy. As the triangle gets smaller, the development occurs less frequently and in a lesser amount.]]
The development of communication throughout one's lifetime is crucial because it is required in almost every aspect of human life. Majority of [[language development]] happens during infancy and early childhood. It is very important that infants learn the principles of communication earlier on in their development. The following information can be used to adapt to the specific attributes in each level of development in order to effectively communicate with an individual of these ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Abigail Peterson|title=The Communication Game|date=1980|publisher=Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Products Company|location=United States of America|isbn=0-931562-05-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of communication and language development that happen in different stages of life include:

''0-1 Years of Age:''
:During the period of infancy, an [[infant]] mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly [[gestures]]) to effectively communicate with others. In the first period of a newborn's life crying is the only means of communication, which is used to demonstrate their needs and wants. Infants, 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Also, within the 1 to 5 month stage the newborn begins laughing. When the infants are 6-7 months old they begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example "mama" and "dada". These words are simply babbled by the infant, lacking meaning and significance. When the infant turns 12 months of age they start to put meaning behind those once babbled words and can start imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. [[Linguistics|Verbal]] communication begins to occur at the age of 10-12 months. It starts with the act of imitating adult language and slowly developing the words "mama" and "dada". They can also respond to simple commands. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning, this enables them to communicate without the use of language yet displays effectively what they are trying to convey to others. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ateah|first1=Christine A.|last2=Kyle|first2=Terri|last3=Scott|first3=Shannon D.|title=Canadian Essentials of Pediatric Nursing|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=China|isbn=978-1-60913-707-6|pages=82–84, 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Nonverbal communication]] begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to breakdown what adults and others are saying to them, they then use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own.&lt;ref name="Haslett &amp; Samter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haslett|first1=B|last2=Samter|first2=W|title=Children communicating: the first 5 years|date=1997|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their own behaviour in social interactions. Infant's readiness to communicate completely effects their language development. Variations in the amount of interaction between a mother and her child will effect certain aspects of the infant's language performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Abigail Peterson|title=The Communication Game|date=1980|publisher=Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Products Company|location=United States of America|isbn=0-931562-05-8|pages=1–18, 49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1-2 Years of Age:''
:Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. The parental role is a large influence on the development of communication in children. Adults are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation etiquette. The vocabulary of a 1-2 year old should consist of 50 words yet can hold up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crais|first1=Elizabeth|title=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|journal=Use of Gesture Development in Profiling Children's Prelinguistic Communication Skills.|date=February 2009|volume= 18|issue=1|pages=95–108|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5040224c-8845-40e1-9be4-3475ec28057f%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=38&amp;hid=4105|accessdate=28 September 2014|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/07-0041)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''2-3 Years of Age:''
:Children ages 2-3 experience something known as the turn-taking style. In this stage, children communicate best in a turn-taking style as it brings cohesive interaction into their channel of communication and a conversational structure is in place, which makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. This also teaches them skills of patience, kindness, and respect early on as they learn from the direction of elders that one person is able to speak at a given time. This creates biological patterns for the child and creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines which shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"&gt;Haslett, B., &amp; Samter, W. (1997). Developing verbal communication. In Children communicating: The first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver because this is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child and taking ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"/&gt;

''3-5 Years of Age:''
:This age group can also be classified as the [[pre-school]] age group as children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent while connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. [[Stuttering]] can be an effect of newly acquired verbal communication for children when they are around the age of three and can generally result in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z).&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"&gt;Ateah, Christine A.; Kyle, Terri; Scott, Shannon D. (2008). Canadian Essentials of Pediatric Nursing. China: Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. pp. 82–84, 108–109, 136–137, 160, 183. {{ISBN|978-1-60913-707-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use the correct tenses when they are communicating. As they continue to develop their communication skills they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conti-Ramsden | first1 = Gina | year = 2012 | title = Jun 17). "Human Communication and Deafness" | url = | journal = Language development and assessment in the preschool period | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 384–401 | doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conversing with adults, this is the stage when most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of the conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and an understanding of the verbal and nonverbal cues that the child is now aware of and will avoid in the future. They learn skills like taking turns and ideas of when communication is acceptable. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response.

''5-10 Years of Age:''
:A lot of language development that happens during this time period takes place in a school setting. During the beginning of the school age years, children’s vocabulary expands through increases in reading. Increased exposure to reading also helps school-aged children learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. These changes improve their communication skills because the message of what they are trying to say will become clearer. They also begin to develop [[metalinguistic awareness]] which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. This ability helps them understand jokes and riddles because they can comprehend the differences in the words. Having the skills to read well is a gateway for learning new [[vernacular]] at a young age and having the confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental part socially and physiologically for the child.&lt;ref name="Strom, R. 1987 pp. 270-278"&gt;Strom, R., Bernard, H., &amp; Strom, S. (1987). Fostering effective communication. In Human Development and Learning (pp. 270-278). New York, NY: Human Sciences Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures.&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"/&gt; As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. This new form of message complexity shows growth in a child's interpersonal communication and how they interpret language of others.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"/&gt;

''10-18 Years of Age:''
:By the age of 10, individuals can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During the end of this period the individual reaches maturity influencing their cognitive potential, affecting their communication. During this time, there are rises in the sophistication and effectiveness for communication skills. [[Adolescence|Adolescents]] go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development which influences the way they communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Martine (March 2005). "AAC: Augmentative &amp; Alternative Communication". The Dual Challenges of Aided Communication and Adolescence. Vol. 21 (1): 67-79. Retrieved 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The individual has reached a higher level of education which has increased their vocabulary and grammar. However, adolescents tend to use [[Colloquialism|colloquial speech]] (slang) which can increase confusion and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"/&gt; Also, an individual’s interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development.&lt;ref name="Strom, R. 1987 pp. 270-278"/&gt; The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage.

== Theories ==

===Uncertainty reduction theory===
{{Main|Uncertainty reduction theory}}
Uncertainty reduction theory comes from the sociopsychological perspective. It addresses the basic process of how we gain knowledge about other people. According to the theory, people have difficulty with uncertainty. They want to be able to predict behavior, and therefore, they are motivated to seek more information about people.&lt;ref name="Berger Calabrese 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Calabrese | first2 = R. J. | year = 1975 | title = Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 99–112 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory argues that strangers, upon meeting, go through certain steps and checkpoints in order to reduce uncertainty about each other and form an idea of whether one likes or dislikes the other. As we communicate, we are making plans to accomplish our goals.
At highly uncertain moments, we become more vigilant and rely more on data available in the situation. When we are less certain, we lose confidence in our own plans and make contingency plans. The theory also says that higher levels of uncertainty create distance between people and that non-verbal expressiveness tends to help reduce uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"&gt;Foss, K. &amp; Littlejohn, S. (2008). Theories of Human Communication, Ninth Edition. Belmont, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructs include level of uncertainty, nature of the relationship and ways to reduce uncertainty. Underlying assumptions include that an individual will cognitively process the existence of uncertainty and take steps to reduce it. The boundary conditions for this theory are that there must be some kind of outside social situation trigger and internal cognitive process.

According to the theory, we reduce uncertainty in three ways:

#Passive strategies: observing the person.
#Active strategies: asking others about the person or looking up info.
#Interactive strategies: asking questions, self-disclosure.

Uncertainty Reduction Theory is most applicable to the initial interaction context, and in response to this limited context, scholars have extended the uncertainty framework with theories that describe [[Anxiety/uncertainty management|uncertainty manangement]], more broadly, and [[Theory of Motivated Information Management|motivated information management]]. These subsequent theories give a broader conceptualization of how uncertainty operates in interpersonal communication as well as how uncertainty motivates individuals to seek information.

=== Social exchange theory ===
{{Main|Social exchange theory}}
[[Social exchange theory]] falls under the symbolic interaction perspective. The theory predicts, explains, and describes when and why people reveal certain information about themselves to others. The [[social exchange theory]] uses Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) theory of interdependence. This theory states that "relationships grow, develop, deteriorate, and dissolve as a consequence of an unfolding social-exchange process, which may be conceived as a bartering of rewards and costs both between the partners and between members of the partnership and others" (Huston &amp; Burgess, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;4). Social exchange theory argues the major force in interpersonal relationships is the satisfaction of both people's self-interest. Theorists say self-interest is not necessarily a bad thing and that it can actually enhance relationships.&lt;ref name="Homas 1958"&gt;{{cite journal
 | doi= 10.1086/222355
 | last= Homans | first=George C.
 | author-link=George C. Homans
 | year= 1958
 | title=Social Behavior as Exchange
 | journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]
 | volume= 63 | issue=6
 | pages=597–606
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, human interaction is like an economic transaction, in that you may seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. You will reveal information about yourself when the cost-rewards ratio is acceptable to you. As long as rewards continue to outweigh costs, a couple will become increasingly intimate by sharing more and more personal information. The constructs of this theory include discloser, relational expectations, and perceived rewards or costs in the relationship. Levinger (1965, 1976) discussed marital success as dependent on all the rewarding things within the relationship, such as emotional security and sexual fulfillment. He also argued that marriages either succeed or fail based on the barriers to leave the relationship, like financial hardships, and the presence of alternative attractions, like infidelity. Levinger stated that marriages will fail when the attractions of the partners lessen, the barriers to leave the spouse are weak, and the alternatives outside of the relationship are appealing.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"/&gt;

The underlying assumptions include that humans weigh out rewards versus costs when developing a relationship. The boundary conditions for this theory are that at least two people must be having some type of interaction.

Social exchange also ties in closely with social penetration theory.

=== Symbolic interaction ===
{{main|Symbolic interaction}}
Symbolic interaction comes from the sociocultural perspective in that it relies on the creation of shared meaning through interactions with others. This theory focuses on the ways in which people form meaning and structure in society through interactions. People are motivated to act based on the meanings they assign to people, things, and events.&lt;ref name="Mead 1934"&gt;Mead, G. H. (1934). Mind, self and society Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic interaction argues the world is made up of social objects that are named and have socially determined meanings. When people interact over time, they come to shared meaning for certain terms and actions and thus come to understand events in particular ways.
There are three main concepts in this theory: society, self, and mind.

;Society: Social acts (which create meaning) involve an initial gesture from one individual, a response to that gesture from another and a result.
;Self: Self-image comes from interaction with others based on others perceptions.&lt;br&gt;A person makes sense of the world and defines their "self" through social interactions. One ’s self is a significant object and like all social objects it is defined through social interactions with others.
;Mind: Your ability to use significant symbols to respond to yourself makes thinking possible. You define objects in terms of how you might react to them. Objects become what they are through our symbolic minding process.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"/&gt;

Constructs for this theory include creation of meaning, social norms, human interactions, and signs and symbols. An underlying assumption for this theory is that meaning and social reality are shaped from interactions with others and that some kind of shared meaning is reached. The boundary conditions for this theory are there must be numerous people communicating and interacting and thus assigning meaning to situations or objects.

=== Relational dialectics theory ===
{{main|Relational dialectics}}

A dialectical approach to interpersonal communication was developed by scholars Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery. Their dialectical approach revolves around the notions of contradiction, change, praxis, and totality. Influenced by Hegel, Marx, and Bakhtin, the dialectical approach is informed by an epistemology that refers to a method of reasoning by which one searches for understanding through the tension of opposing arguments. Utilizing the dialectical approach, Baxter and Montgomery developed two types of dialectics that function in interpersonal relationships: internal and external. These include autonomy-connection, novelty-predictability, openness-closedness.

In order to understand relational dialectics theory, we must first understand specifically what encompasses the term ''discourse''. Therefore, discourses are "systems of meaning that are uttered whenever we make intelligible utterances aloud with others or in our heads when we hold internal conversations".&lt;ref name="Baxter Braithwaite 2008"/&gt; Now, taking the term ''discourse'' and coupling it with Relational Dialectics Theory, it is assumed that this theory "emerges from the interplay of competing discourses".&lt;ref name="Baxter Braithwaite 2008"&gt;Baxter, L., Braithwaite, D. (2008). Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory also poses the primary assumption that, "Dialogue is simultaneously unity and difference".&lt;ref name="Anderson Baxter Cissna 2004"&gt;Anderson, R., Baxter, L., Cissna, K., (2004). Dialogue: Theorizing difference in communication studies. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these assumptions insinuate the concept of creating meaning within ourselves and others when we communicate. However, it also shows how the meanings within our conversations may be interpreted, understood, and of course misunderstood. Hence, the creation and interpretations we find in our communicative messages may create strains in our communicative acts that can be termed as ‘dialectical tensions.’

So, if we assume the stance that all of our discourse, whether in external conversations or internally within ourselves, has competing properties, then we can take relational dialectics theory and look at what the competing discourses are in our conversations, and then analyze how this may have an effect on various aspects of our lives.
Numerous examples of this can be seen in the daily communicative acts we participate in. However, dialectical tensions within our discourses can most likely be seen in interpersonal communication due to the close nature of interpersonal relationships. The well known proverb "opposites attract, but birds of a feather flock together" exemplifies these dialectical tensions.&lt;ref name="Baxter Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L., Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating: Dialogues and dialectics. New York City: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The three relational dialectics====
In order to understand relational dialectics theory, one must also be aware of the assumption that there are three different types of relational dialectics. These consist of connectedness and separateness, certainty and uncertainty, and openness and closedness.

====Connectedness and separateness====
Most individuals naturally desire to have a close bond in the interpersonal relationships we are a part of. However, it is also assumed that no relationship can be enduring without the individuals involved within it also having their time alone to themselves. Individuals who are only defined by a specific relationship they are a part of can result in the loss of individual identity.

====Certainty and uncertainty====
Individuals desire a sense of assurance and predictability in the interpersonal relationships they are a part of. However, they also desire having a variety in their interactions that come from having spontaneity and mystery within their relationships as well. Much research has shown that relationships which become bland and ..monotonous are not desirable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

====Openness and closedness====
In close interpersonal relationships, individuals may often feel a pressure to reveal personal information. This assumption can be supported if one looks at the postulations within social penetration theory, which is another theory used often within the study of communication. This tension may also spawn a natural desire to keep an amount of personal privacy from other individuals. The struggle in this sense, illustrates the essence of relational dialectics.

=== Coordinated management of meaning ===
{{main|Coordinated management of meaning}}
Coordinated management of meaning is a theory assuming that two individuals engaging in an interaction are each constructing their own interpretation and perception behind what a conversation means. A core assumption within this theory includes the belief that all individuals interact based on rules that are expected to be followed while engaging in communication. "Individuals within any social situation first want to understand what is going on and apply rules to figure things out."&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"&gt;Littlejohn, S. (1996). Theories of human communication (Ed 5). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different types of rules that individuals can apply in any communicative situation. These include constitutive and regulative rules.

;Constitutive rules: "are essentially rules of meaning used by communicators to interpret or understand an event or message".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt;
;Regulative rules: "are essentially rules of action used to determine how to respond or behave".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt;

An example of this can be seen if one thinks of a hypothetical situation in which two individuals are engaging in conversation. If one individual sends a message to the other, the message receiver must then take that interaction and interpret what it means. Often, this can be done on an almost instantaneous level because the interpretation rules applied to the situation are immediate and simple. However, there are also times when one may have to search for an appropriate interpretation of the ‘rules’ within an interaction. This simply depends on each communicator's previous beliefs and perceptions within a given context and how they can apply these rules to the current communicative interaction.
Important to understand within the constructs of this theory is the fact that these "rules" of meaning "are always chosen within a context".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt; Furthermore, the context of a situation can be understood as a framework for interpreting specific events.

The authors of this theory believe that there are a number of different context an individual can refer to when interpreting a communicative event. These include the relationship context, the episode context, the self-concept context, and the archetype context.

;Relationship context: This context assumes that there are mutual expectations between individuals who are members of a group.
;Episode context: This context simply refers to a specific event in which the communicative act is taking place.
;Self-concept context: This context involves one's sense of self, or an individual's personal ‘definition’ of him/herself.
;Archetype context: This context is essentially one's image of what his or her belief consists of regarding general truths within communicative exchanges.

Furthermore, Pearce and Cronen believe that these specific contexts exist in a hierarchical fashion. This theory assumes that the bottom level of this hierarchy consists of the communicative act. Next, the hierarchy exists within the relationship context, then the episode context, followed by the self-concept context, and finally the archetype context.

=== Social penetration theory ===

{{main|Social penetration theory}}

Developed by Irwin Altman and Dallas Taylor, the social penetration theory was made to provide conceptual framework that describes the development in interpersonal relationships. This theory refers to the reciprocity of behaviors between two people who are in the process of developing a relationship. These behaviors can vary from verbal/nonverbal exchange, interpersonal perceptions, and one's use of the environment around them. The behaviors vary based on the different levels of intimacy that a relationship encounters.&lt;ref name= "Altman"&gt;Altman, Irwin; Taylor, Dalmas A. (1973). Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, p. 3, {{ISBN|978-0030766350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Onion Theory"'''

This theory is best known as the "onion theory". This analogy suggests that like an onion, personalities have "layers" that start from the outside (what the public sees) all the way to the core (one's private self). Often, when a relationship begins to develop, it is customary for the individuals within the relationship to undergo a process of [[self-disclosure]].&lt;ref name= "Baack"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baack | first1 = Donald | last2 = Fogliasso | first2 = Christine | last3 = Harris | first3 = James | year = 2000 | title = The Personal Impact of Ethical Decisions: A Social Penetration Theory | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 39–49 | doi=10.1023/a:1006016113319}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people divulge information about themselves, their "layers" begin to peel, and once those "layers" peel away they cannot go back; just like you can't put the layers back on an onion.&lt;ref name= "Griffin"&gt;Griffin, E. (2012). A First Look at Communication Theory (9th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. pp. 115-117, {{ISBN|978-0-07-353430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four different stages that social penetration theory encompasses. These stages include the orientation, exploratory affective exchange, affective exchange, and stable exchange.&lt;ref name= "Mongeau"&gt;Mongeau, P., and M. Henningsen. "Stage theories of relationship development." Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (2008): 363-375.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Orientation stage: At first, strangers exchange very little amounts of information and they are very cautious in their interactions. 
;Exploratory affective stage: Next, individuals become somewhat more friendly and relaxed with their communication styles.
;Affective exchange: In the third stage, there is a high amount of open communication between individuals and typically these relationships consist of close friends or even romantic or platonic partners.
;Stable stage: The final stage, simply consists of continued expressions of open and personal types of interaction.&lt;ref name= "Mongeau" /&gt;

If a person speeds through the stages and happens to share too much information too fast, the receiver may view that interaction as negative and a relationship between the two is less likely to form.

'''Example'''- Jenny just met Justin because they were sitting at the same table at a wedding. Within minutes of meeting one another, Justin engages in small talk with Jenny. Jenny decides to tell Justin all about her terrible ex-boyfriend and all of the misery he put her through. This is the kind of information you wait to share until stages three or four, not stage one. Due to the fact that Jenny told Justin much more than he wanted to know, he probably views her in a negative aspect and thinks she is crazy, which will most likely prevent any future relationship from happening.

Altman and Taylor believed the social exchange theory principles could accurately predict whether or not people will risk self-disclosure. The principles included, relational outcome, relational stability, and relational satisfaction. This theory assumes that the possible outcome is the stance that which the decision making process of how much information an individual chooses to self disclose is rooted by weighing out the costs and rewards that an individual may acquire when choosing to share personal information. Due to '''ethical egoism''', individuals try to maximize their pleasure and minimize their pain; acting from the motive of self-interest.&lt;ref name= "Ethical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/ethical_ego.html|title=Ethics - Ethical Egoism N.p. |date= 9 October 2009|accessdate=4 December 2012|website=philosophy.lander.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is more of a hassle to you than an asset, it is more likely that you will dispose of them as a friend because it is decreasing the amount of pleasure in your life.

An example of the social penetration theory can be seen when one thinks of a hypothetical situation such as meeting someone for the first time. The '''depth of penetration''' is the degree of intimacy a relationship has accomplished. When two individuals meet for the first time, it is the cultural expectation that only impersonal information will be exchanged. This could include information such as names, occupations, age of the conversation participants, as well as various other impersonal information. However, if both members participating in the dialogic exchange decide that they would like to continue or further the relationship, with the continuation of message exchanges, the more personal the information exchanged will become. Altman and Taylor defined these as the depth and breadth of self-disclosure. According to Griffin, the definition of '''depth''' is "the degree of disclosure in a specific area of an individuals life" and the definition of '''breadth''' is "the range of areas in an individual's life over which disclosure takes place."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Altman and Taylor discussed the process of four observations that are the reasons a relationship occurs:
;1. Peripheral items are exchanged more frequently and sooner than private information
;2. Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially in the early stages of relationship development
;3. Penetration is rapid at the start but slows down quickly as the tightly wrapped inner layers are reached
;4. Depenetration is a gradual process of layer-by-layer withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;

"'''Computer Mediated Social Penetration'''"

Also important to note, is the fact that due to current communicative exchanges involving a high amount of computer mediated contexts in which communication occurs, this area of communication should be addressed in regard to social penetration theory as well. Online communication seems to follow a different set of rules. Because much of online communication between people occurs on an anonymous level, individuals are allowed the freedom of foregoing the interpersonal ‘rules’ of self disclosure. Rather than slowly disclosing personal thoughts, emotions, and feelings to others, anonymous individuals online are able to disclose personal information immediately and without the consequence of having their identity revealed. Ledbetter notes that Facebook users self-disclose by posting personal information, pictures, hobbies, and messages. The study finds that the user's level of self-disclosure is directly related to the level of interdependence on others. This may result in negative psychological and relational outcomes as studies show that people are more likely to disclose more personal information than they would in face to face communication, primarily due to the heightened level of control within the context of the online communication medium. In other words, those with poor social skills may prefer the medium of Facebook to show others who they are because they have more control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ledbetter | first1 = Andrew M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2011 | title = Attitudes Toward Online Social Connection And Self-Disclosure As Predictors Of Facebook Communication And Relational Closeness | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 27–53 | doi=10.1177/0093650210365537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to an avoidance of face-to-face communication, which is undoubtedly harmful to interpersonal relationships. The reason that self disclosure is labeled as risky, is because, individuals often undergo a sense of uncertainty and susceptibility in revealing personal information that has the possibility of being judged in a negative way by the receiver. Hence, the reason that face-to-face communication must evolve in stages when an initial relationship develops.

===Relational patterns of interaction theory===

Relational patterns of interaction theory of the cybernetic tradition, studies how relationships are defined by peoples’ interactions during communication.&lt;ref name="Watzlawick Beavin Jackson 1967"&gt;Watzlawick, P., Beavin, J., &amp; Jackson, D. (1967). Pragmatics of Human Communication: A Study of Interactional Patterns, Pathologies, and Paradoxes (pp. 120 – 121). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Bateson, Paul Watzlawick, et al. laid the groundwork for this theory and went on to become known as the [[Palo Alto Group]]. Their theory became the foundation from which scholars in the field of communication approached the study of relationships.

====Ubiquitous communication====
The Palo Alto Group maintains that a person's presence alone results in them, consciously or not, expressing things about themselves and their relationships with others (i.e., communicating).&lt;ref name="Beavin 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beavin | first1 = J | year = 1990 | title = Behaving and communicating: a reply to Motley | url = | journal = Western Journal of Speech Communication | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 593–602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person cannot avoid interacting, and even if they do, their avoidance may be read as a statement by others. This ubiquitous interaction leads to the establishment of "expectations" and "patterns" which are used to determine and explain relationship types.

====Expectations====
Individuals enter communication with others having established expectations for their own behavior as well as the behavior of those they are communicating with. These expectations are either reinforced during the interaction, or new expectations are established which will be used in future interactions. These new expectations are created by new patterns of interaction, established expectations are a result of established patterns of interaction.

====Patterns of interaction====
Established patterns of interaction are created when a trend occurs regarding how two people interact with each other. There are two patterns of particular importance to the theory which form two kinds of relationships.

===== Symmetrical relationships =====
These relationships are established when the pattern of interaction is defined by two people responding to one and other in the same way. This is a common pattern of interaction within power struggles.

===== Complementary relationships =====
These relationships are established when the pattern of interaction is defined by two people responding to one and other in opposing ways. An example of such a relationship would be when one person is argumentative while the other is quiet.

====Relational control====
Relational control refers to who, within a relationship, is in control of it. The pattern of behavior between partners over time, not any individual's behavior, defines the control within a relationship. Patterns of behavior involve individuals’ responses to others’ assertions.

There are three kinds of responses:
* One-down responses are submissive to, or accepting of, another's assertions.
* One-up responses are in opposition to, or counter, another's assertions.
* One-across responses are neutral in nature.

Seth Weiss and Marian Houser add to relational control in a teacher/student context. "Students communicating with instructors for relational purposes hope to develop or maintain a personal relationship; functional reasons aim to seek more information presented and discussed by instructors; students communicating to explain a lack of responsibility utilize an excuse-making motive; participatory motives demonstrate understanding and interest in the class or course material; and students communicating for sycophantic purposes hope to make a favorable impression on their instructor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Seth|author2=Marian Houser|title=Student Communication Motives and Interpersonal Attraction Toward Instructor|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=August 2007|volume=24|series=3|pages=215–224|doi=10.1080/08824090701439091}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complementary exchanges====
A complementary exchange occurs when a partner asserts a one-up message which the other partner responds to with a one-down response. When complementary exchanges are frequently occurring within a relationship, and the parties at each end of the exchange tend to remain uniform, it is a good indication of a complementary relationship existing.

====Symmetrical exchanges====
Symmetrical exchanges occur when one partner's assertion is countered with a reflective response. So, when a one-up assertion is met with a one-up response, or when a one-down assertions is met with a one-down response, a symmetrical exchange occurs. When symmetrical exchanges are frequently occurring within a relationship, it is a good indication of a symmetrical relationship existing.

=== Theory of intertype relationships ===

{{main|Socionics}}

[[Socionics]] has proposed a theory of intertype relationships between psychological types based on a modified version of [[C.G. Jung]]'s theory of [[psychological types]]. Communication between types is described using the concept of [[information metabolism]] proposed by [[Antoni Kępiński]]. Socionics allocates 16 types of the relations — from most attractive and comfortable up to disputed. The understanding of a nature of these relations helps to solve a number of problems of the interpersonal relations, including aspects of psychological and sexual compatibility. The researches of married couples by [[Alexander Bukalov|Aleksandr Bukalov]] et al.,  have shown that the family relations submit to the laws, which are opened by socionics. The study of socionic type allocation in casually selected married couples confirmed the main rules of the theory of intertype relations in socionics.&lt;ref&gt;Bukalov A.V., Karpenko O.B., Chykyrysova G.V. [http://socionic.info/pdf/couples.pdf "Statistics of intertype relationships in married couples"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukalov A.V., Karpenko O.B., Chykyrysova G.V. [http://socionic.info/pdf/Socionics.pdf "Socionics: the effective theory of the mental structure and the interpersonal relations forecasting"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity management theory ===

{{main|Identity management theory}}

Falling under the socio-cultural tradition and developed by Tadasu Todd Imahori and William R. Cupach, identity-management theory explains the establishment, development, and maintenance of identities within relationships, as well as changes which occur to identities due to relationships.&lt;ref name="Imahori Cupach 1993"&gt;Imahori, T. &amp; Cupach, W. (1993). Identity management theory: communication competence in intercultural episodes and relationships. In Wiseman, R. L. &amp; Koester, J., (Eds.), Intercultural Communication Competence (pp. 112 – 31). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Establishing identities====
People establish their identities (or faces), and their partners, through a process referred to as "facework".&lt;ref name="Domenici Littlejohn 2006"&gt;Domenici, K. &amp; Littlejohn, W. (2006). Facework: Bridging Theory and Practice. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone has a desired identity which they’re constantly working towards establishing. This desired identity can be both threatened and supported by attempting to negotiate a relational identity (the identity one shares with their partner). So, our desired identity is directly influenced by our relationships, and our relational identity by our desired individual identity.

====Cultural influence====
Identity-management pays significant attention to intercultural relationships and how they affect the relational and individual identities of those involved. How partners of different cultures negotiate with each other, in an effort to satisfy desires for adequate autonomous identities and relational identities, is important to identity-management theory. People take different approaches to coping with this problem of cultural influence.

====Tensions within intercultural relationships====
Identity freezing occurs when one partner feels like they’re being stereotyped and not recognized as a complex individual. This tends to occur early on in relationships, prior to partners becoming well acquainted with each other, and threatens individuals’ identities. Showing support for oneself, indicating positive aspects of one's cultural identity, and having a good sense of humor are examples of coping mechanisms used by people who feel their identities are being frozen. It is also not uncommon for people in such positions to react negatively, and cope by stereotyping their partner, or totally avoiding the tension.

When tension is due to a partner feeling that their cultural identity is being ignored, it is referred to as a nonsupport problem. This is a threat to one's face, and individuals often cope with it in the same ways people cope with identity freezing.

Self-other faceground, giving in, alternating in their support of each identity, and also by avoiding the issue completely.

====Relational stages of identity management====
Identity management is an ongoing process which Imahori and Cupach define as having three relational stages.&lt;ref name="Imahori Cupach 1993"/&gt; Typically, each stage is dealt with differently by couples.

The trial stage occurs at the beginning of an intercultural relationship when partners are beginning to explore their cultural differences. During this stage, each partner is attempting to determine what cultural identities they want for the relationship. At this stage, cultural differences are significant barriers to the relationship and it is critical for partners to avoid identity freezing and nonsupport. During this stage, individuals are more willing to risk face threats to establish a balance necessary for the relationship.

The enmeshment stage occurs when a relational identity emerges with established common cultural features. During this stage, the couple becomes more comfortable with their collective identity and the relationship in general.

The renegotiation stage sees couples working through identity issues and drawing on their past relational history while doing so. A strong relational identity has been established by this stage and couples have mastered dealing with cultural differences. It is at this stage that cultural difference become part of the relationships and not a tension within them.

=== Communication privacy management theory ===
{{main|Communication privacy management theory}}
Of the socio-cultural tradition, communication privacy management theory is concerned with how people negotiate openness and privacy in concern to communicated information. This theory focuses on how people in relationships manage boundaries which separate the public from the private.&lt;ref name="Petronio 2002"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boundaries====
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever changing, and allow certain parts of the public, access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. This sharing occurs only when the individual has weighed their need to share the information against their need to protect themselves. This risk assessment is used by couples when evaluating their relationship boundaries. The disclosure of private information to a partner may result in greater intimacy, but it may also result in the discloser becoming more vulnerable.

====Co-ownership of information====
When someone chooses to reveal private information to another person, they are making that person a co-owner of the information. Co-ownership comes with rules, responsibilities, and rights which the discloser of the information and receiver of it negotiate. Examples of such rules would be: Can the information be disclosed? When can the information be disclosed? To whom can the information be disclosed? And how much of the information can be disclosed? The negotiation of these rules can be complex, the rules can be explicit as well as implicit, and they can be violated.

====Boundary turbulence====
What Petronio refers to as "boundary turbulence" occurs when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners, and when a co-owner of information deliberately violates the rules. This usually results in some kind of conflict, is not uncommon, and often results in one party becoming more apprehensive about future revelation of information to the violator.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
{{main|Cognitive dissonance}}
The theory of cognitive dissonance, part of the Cybernetic Tradition, explains how humans are consistency seekers and attempt to reduce their dissonance, or discomfort, in new situations.&lt;ref name="Festinger 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed in the 1950s by Leon Festinger.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang (2008). Cognitive Dissonance Theory. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' Donsbach, Wolfgang (ed). Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals encounter new information or new experiences, they categorize the information based on their preexisting attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs. If the new encounter does not coincide with their preexisting assumptions, then dissonance is likely to occur. When dissonance does occur, individuals are motivated to reduce the dissonance they experience by avoiding situations that would either cause the dissonance or increase the dissonance. For this reason, cognitive dissonance is considered a drive state that encourages motivation to achieve consonance and reduce dissonance.
An example of cognitive dissonance would be if someone holds the belief that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important, but they don't regularly work out or eat healthy. They may experience dissonance between their beliefs and their actions. If there is a significant amount of dissonance, they may be motivated to change their attitudes and work out more or eat healthier foods. They may also be inclined to avoid situations that will point out the fact that their attitudes and beliefs are inconsistent, such as avoiding the gym or not reading health reports.

====The selection process====
;Selective exposure: is a method for reducing dissonance that only seeking information that is consonant with one's current beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective attention: is a method for reducing dissonance by only paying attention to particular information or parts of information that is consonant with current beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective interpretation: is a method for reducing dissonance by interpreting ambiguous information so that it seems consistent with one's beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective retention: when an individual only remembers information that is consistent with their current beliefs.

====Types of cognitive relationships====
According to cognitive dissonance theory, there are three types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant relationships. Consonant relationships are when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant relationships are when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant relationships are when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.

===Attribution theory===
{{main|Attribution theory}}
Attribution theory is part of the sociopsychological tradition and explains how individuals go through a process that makes inferences about observed behavior. Attribution theory assumes that we make attributions, or social judgments, as a way to clarify or predict behavior. Attribution theory assumes that we are sense-making creatures and that we draw conclusions of the actions that we observe.

====Steps to the attribution process====

#The first step of the attribution process is to observe the behavior or action.
#The second step is to make judgments of interactions and the intention of that particular action.
#The last step of the attribution process is making the attribution which will be either internal, where the cause is related to the person, or external, where the cause of the action is circumstantial.

An example of this process is when a student fails a test, an observer may choose to attribute that action to 'internal' causes, such as insufficient study, laziness, or have a poor work ethic. The action might also be attributed to 'external' factors such as the difficulty of the test, or real-world stressors that led to distraction.

We also make attributions of our own behavior. Using this same example, if it were you who received a failing test score you might either make an internal attribution, such as "I just can’t understand this material", or you could make an external attribution, such as "this test was just too difficult."

====Fundamental attribution error====
As we make attributions, we may fall victim to the fundamental attribution error which is when we overemphasize internal attributions for others and underestimate external attributions.

====Actor-observer bias====
Similar to the fundamental attribution error, we may overestimate external attributions for our own behavior and underestimate internal attributions.

=== Expectancy violations theory ===
{{main|Expectancy violations theory}}
Expectancy violations theory is part of the sociopsychological tradition, and explains the relationship between non-verbal message production and the interpretations people hold for those non-verbal behaviors. Individuals hold certain expectations for non-verbal behavior that is based on the social norms, past experience and situational aspects of that behavior. When expectations are either met or violated, we make assumptions of the behavior and judge them to be positive or negative.

====Arousal====
When a deviation of expectations occurs, there is an increased interest in the situation, also known as arousal. There are two types of arousal:
;Cognitive arousal: our mental awareness of expectancy deviations
;Physical arousal: challenges our body faces as a result of expectancy deviations.

====Reward valence====
When an expectation is not met, we hold particular perceptions as to whether or not that violation is considered rewarding. How an individual evaluates the interaction will determine how they view the positive or negative impact of the violation.

====Proxemics====
The study of proxemics was originated by Edward T. Hall. The study of proxemics focuses on the use of space to communicate. According to Edward T. Hall's Theory of Personal Space, there are four spaces in which we situate our bodies to communicate.

;Intimate distance: 0&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;inches. This is often reserved for intimate relationships with significant others. It is also reserved for the parent-child relationship (hugging, cuddling, kisses, etc.)
;Personal distance: 38&amp;nbsp;inches &amp;ndash; 64&amp;nbsp;feet. This is often reserved for close friends and acquaintances, such as significant others and close friends. For instance, sitting close to a friend or family member on the couch.
;Social distance: 54&amp;ndash;82&amp;nbsp;feet. This is often reserved for professional situations, such as interviews and meetings.
;Public distance: 32&amp;nbsp;feet or more. This is often reserved for public spaces, such as waiting in an airport, sitting in a waiting room at a doctor's office, or choosing a seat in the movie theater.

====Dyadic communication and Relationships====
Dyadic communication is the part of a relationship that calls for "something to happen". Partners will either talk or argue with one another during this point of a relationship to bring about change. When partners talk or argue with one another, the relationship may still survive at this point.

Bochner (2000) stresses inherent dialectic in interpersonal communication as the key to healthy marital dyads. He proposes that people in intimate relationships are looking to find an equilibrium point between needing to be open with their partner and needing to protect their partner from the consequences of this openness. Therefore, the communication in romantic, long-term relationships can be viewed as a balance between hiding and revealing. Taking this theory even further, communication within marriages can be viewed as a continuing refinement and elimination of conversational material. The partners of the marriage will still have things to discuss, but as their relationship and communication grows, they can decide when to not speak about an issue, because in complex relationships like marriage, anything can become an issue.

;Conflict resolution
Sillars (1380) and Roloff (1876) expressed that conflict resolution strategies can be categorized as pro-social or anti-social in nature. When an individual is presented with an interpersonal conflict, they can decide how they want to deal with it. They can avoid (anti-social), compete (anti-social), or cooperate (pro-social). It has been learned that one who avoids conflict is less capable of solving problems because they are more constricted. Avoidance has negative effects on dyads.

;The Couples Coping Enhancement Training (CCET)
This program is based on stress, coping, and research on dyads (Bodenmann, 1997a; 2000b). The focus is on individual and dyadic coping to help promote satisfaction within marriage and to help reduce distress within marriages. CCET states three important factors for dyads being successful when they enter counseling programs. Firstly, the dyad's ability to cope with daily stress is a main factor in determining the success or failure of their relationship. Couples need to be educated about ways to manage daily stress so that this stress is not placed on their partner or on their relationship. Secondly, couples who enter counseling to help their relationship must stay in counseling to continue to get reinforcement and encourage about practicing their new methods of communication. Continued counseling will help the couple to maintain their new strategies. Lastly, couples should make use of technology within their counseling. They should use the Internet and seek help online in addition to their counseling program. Having technology that can help couples with immediate problems is a very useful thing.

;Parenting
Many theorists have studied how the relationship between the husband and wife greatly affects the relationship between the parent and child (Belsky, 1990; Parke &amp; Tinsley, 1987). There have been numerous studies done that show how difficult it is to maintain a positive and healthy parent-child relationship when the marriage between the parents is failing. "Spillover," emotional transmission from one family relationship to another, is a likely explanation as to why parents have trouble fostering a good relationship with their children when there are problems within their marriage (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, &amp; Wethington, 1989; Repetti, 1987).

New Parenthood and Marital Quality:

New parenthood is a time where there are many adjustments within a family and these adjustments can put a lot of stress on marital dyads. How a couple deals with first-time parenthood directly correlates to their marital satisfaction, amount of conflict within their marriage, and the perceptions of themselves (Glade, Bean, &amp; Vira, 2005). Studies show that transitioning into parenting leads to more marital conflicts and less marital satisfaction. When marital dyads have a child, their once dyadic dynamic relationships quickly changes to a triadic relationship, creating a shift in roles. New topics for discussion between the married couple, such as household labor, finances, and child care responsibilities, can lead to major conflicts. It is important for couples to identify ways that may help them maintain marital satisfaction while coping with becoming parents.

===Pedagogical communication===
{{Main|Pedagogical communication}}

Pedagogical communication is an action in which the body, being a part of a relational whole, performs a fundamental role. As such, instructional communication (pedagogical communication) is often conceptualized as a form of interpersonal communication. Various studies on the interaction between teacher and student confirms that there is a strong correlation between the teacher's nonverbal behavior (such as immediacy), as well as verbal behavior (such as out of class communication (OCC)) and the students' level of motivation and proficiency. Nonverbal communication serves as a vehicle for the teacher's affections, intentions, and attitudes towards students, and vice versa. For this reason, the concept of "immediacy" is often studied in pedagogical communication. Immediacy is the perception of physical, emotional, or psychological proximity created by positive communicative behaviors – in the pedagogical relationship, it refers specifically to the communication between teachers and students (Richmond, 2002 ; Sibii, 2010). Studies examining interpersonal communication in instructional communication are published in ''Communication Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rced20/current|title=Communication Education|work=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good communication between teachers and young students is thought to improve the test scores of the students. Some parents of students at The William T. Harris School were interviewed and stated that they can tell how good a teacher is just by watching them in the classroom setting. Observing how teachers talk to their students and how they promote communication between their students can lead to conclusions about how well these students will score on standardized tests. Parents of students at The William T. Harris School have admitted that they do not always trust the publicized rankings of teachers; however, they stated that there are strong similarities between their children's grades and their impressions of their children's teachers.

===Social networks===
{{Main|Social networks}}
According to Malcolm R. Parks (2011) in the SAGE Handbook of Interpersonal Communication, interest in social networks has increased over the past decade among scholars in a variety of disciplines. Networks of all kinds consist of nodes and links. The way these concepts are defined varies across disciplines. Interpersonal communication researchers define nodes as individuals and links are conceptualized as the content or frequency of their interaction or the overall strength of their relationship.

The value of network analysis resides in the identification of the larger patterns or structures created by the way network members are connected to one another. The structures both create and reflect a wide range of social phenomena. Interpersonal communication research has traditionally focused on the attributes of message or communicators, as well as attributes of the relationship between the communicators. Taking a network perspective, however, involves focusing on structures of connections among communicators. Rather describing individuals and their personalities, individuals are described in terms of their relative location within a larger social network structure.

===Hurt===
The topic of hurt in interpersonal relationships has received attention in the study of interpersonal communication. Important to the study of hurt is the concept of "devaluation". Devaluation means feeling unappreciated and unimportant. A person can feel devalued at the individual and relational level. At the individual level, individuals can feel devalued when someone insults their intelligence, appearance, personality, life decisions, etc. At the relational level, individuals can feel devalued when there is a perception that one's partner does not perceive the relationship to be close, important, or as valuable as one would like.

The concept of relational transgressions is also important in understanding hurt. Relational transgressions occur when people violate implicit or explicit relational rules. For instance, if someone believes that their romantic partner should be sexually faithful and emotionally faithful, loyal, and honest, then when someone violates one or more of these standards, they have committed a relational transgression.

Additionally, hurtful messages are communicative messages that inflict psychological pain. According to Vangelisti (1994), words "have the ability to hurt or harm in every bit as real away as physical objects. A few ill-spoken words (e.g. "You're worthless," "You'll never amount to anything," "I don't love you anymore") can strongly affect individuals, interactions, and relationships." (p. 53). Studies have shown that hurtful words and events have negative effects on the relationship. In friendships, studies have found that betrayal leads to less acceptance, trust, and respect, according to Davis and Todd (1985).

Infidelity is a form of hurt that can have particularly strong negative effects on relationships. According to a study by Afifi, Falnto, and Weiner (2001), the methods of discovery of infidelity include: 1) Discovering from a third party; 2) witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as walking in on your partner with someone else; 3) having the partner admit to infidelity after confronting them; 4) having the partner tell you on their own. People who discovered their partner's infidelity first hand were least likely to forgive their partner. Individuals were most likely to forgive their partners when they confessed on their own.

Infidelity can take place in the form of sexual and/or emotional infidelity. Sexual infidelity refers to "sexual activity with someone other than one's long-term partner" (Shackelford &amp; Buss, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1035). Several studies show that most individuals disapprove of sexual infidelity; however, several studies also show that sexual infidelity is quite common (Thompson, 1984). Some studies have found that 30%-40% of dating relationships and 40%-60% of marriages are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity (Guerrero, Spitzberg, &amp; Yoshimura, 2004). Men are more likely than women to have a sexual affair, regardless of whether they are dating or married or dating (Sprecher &amp; McKinney, 1993). In an older study by Blumenstein and Schwartz (1983), 82% of gay male couples reported having an affair, compared to about 28% of lesbian couples and 27% of heterosexual couples. This study is quite dated, so it may not hold true today.

Emotional infidelity refers to emotional involvement with another person, who leads one's partner to channel "emotional resources such as romantic love, time, and attention to someone else" (Shackelford &amp; Buss, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1035). There is less information available on emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity. Reasons for committing infidelity vary. Research on sexual infidelity suggests that dissatisfaction with a current relationship may be the leading cause (Sheppard, Nelson, &amp; Andreoli-Mathie, 1995). Other common causes include boredom, the need for excitement and variety, wanting to feel attractive, sexual incompatibility, and revenge (Fleischman et al., 2005).

Another important element of hurt and infidelity is jealousy. Jealousy involves a reaction to an imagined or actual threat. When people suspect or discover infidelity, jealousy is a common reaction. Jealousy is often the result of a relational transgressions, such as an affair. Jealousy is also seen as a transgression in itself when it is perceived by one's partner to be unwarranted. In interpersonal scholarship, there are numerous kinds of jealousy: romantic, platonic, sexual, friend, family, activity, and intimacy jealousy.

===Conflict===

Many interpersonal communication scholars have sought to define and understand interpersonal conflict. As a result, there are numerous definitions of conflict available. Although these varying perspectives highlight something unique about interpersonal conflict, they also cause some confusion. This has resulted in difficulty in establishing uniform methods of operationalization for those who use social scientific (quantitative) methods of analysis. This means that it is difficult to generalize findings across studies.

According to Barcki and Harwick (2004), who consolidated several definitions across the discipline, conflict can be defined as "a dynamic process that occurs between interdependent parties as they experience negative emotional reactions to perceived disagreements and interference with the attainment of their goals" (p.&amp;nbsp;234). With this definition, conflict has three properties:

#disagreement
#negative emotion
#interference

The disagreement property demonstrates the element of perception in conflict. The negative emotion component demonstrates the affect characteristic. The behavioral element demonstrates the interference characteristic of conflict. Within this definition, conflict can be focused on task or relational issues. Task issues involve events, plans, behaviors, etc. Relational conflict involves dispute over personal issues, attitudes, values, beliefs, behaviors, relationship status, etc.

===Technology and Interpersonal Communication Skills===

Technology has provided the opportunity for quick worldwide access, but individuals who heavily depend on it as their primary method of communication are hindering their own development of interpersonal communication skills (Johnson). Only seven percent of communication is written or verbal, whereas ninety-three percent is nonverbal (Tardanico). Nonverbal communication skills cannot be learned, nor be further developed if there is too much interaction through electronics because there is no way to see facial expressions, body language, or hear tone or inflection in the voice (Johnson). According to psychologists and communication experts, listening and comprehending conversations play a huge role in effective interpersonal communication skills (Robinson, Segal, and Smith). Communication experts suggest handling conflict face to face only because it lessens the potential for miscommunication (Wimer). Research has shown that when children interact too often on electronic devices the proper stimulation and development of the neurotransmitter pathways do not occur and so neuropathways are forced to change in order to adapt. Potential risks consist of inability to have profoundly personal relationships, unable to concentrate accurately, causes issues with self-esteem, or they might not be able to develop the much needed empathetic and sympathetic skillset (Johnson). Worldwide employer surveys indicate one in every five companies have chosen to not fill positions because the candidates do not have the much desired interpersonal communication skills, but most of them are very comfortable navigating social media websites (White).

The '''''Journal of Contemporary Religion''''' is a triannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, and philosophical aspects of religion.

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 1985 as ''Religion Today'' by the Centre for New Religions at [[King's College London]]. Its founding [[editor-in-chief|editor]] was [[Peter B. Clarke]] (later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, Elisabeth. ''Researching new religious movements: responses and redefinitions'', p. ix, Routledge 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-27755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Finke, Roger. ''Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion''. University of California Press 2000, p. 16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard. ''New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World'', Routledge 2006, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal, which changed its name to the current title in 1995,&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew /&gt; is published by [[Routledge]]. Its current editor is [[Elisabeth Arweck]] ([[University of Warwick]]); Peter B. Clarke, who died in June 2011, will remain listed as co-editor until the end of the year out of respect for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peter B. Clarke (1940–2011) |first= Elisabeth |last=Arweck |journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion |volume=26|issue=3 |pages = 353|year=2011 |doi=10.1080/13537903.2011.620796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=cjcr20 Editorial Board], Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THE&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Lipner, Julius]] (1997-10-17). [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159825&amp;sectioncode=26 "Social science &amp; humanities journals: Prayers for today"], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue of the triannual journal typically features five or six major articles.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; Other content includes conference reports, research notes, book reviews and review articles, and articles are sometimes illustrated with graphics or photographs.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' stated in a 1997 review of the journal that "The contributors are invariably academics, mainly from North America and Europe. The style ranges from the homely, almost chatty at times, to the more formal. The articles, however, are on the whole scholarly and, as advertised, treat of a wide range of subjects, from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]] to [[Sahaja Yoga]], from the '[[Toronto Blessing]]' to the nature of [[fundamentalism]], from 'The Protestant eruption into modern Brazilian politics' to 'Deconfessionalisation in the Netherlands' (in the last three decades or so). There are fieldwork reports, ethnographic accounts, and historical and conceptual studies. The standard of research and analysis is what one would expect from a good academic journal."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; The review criticised the small number and seemingly arbitrary selection of book reviews, but concluded by stating that "On the whole, then, the journal is a valuable research tool and source of new knowledge for scholars, teachers and others interested in studying the phenomenon of contemporary religion. With nothing really comparable available in the field, it is highly recommended."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts]], [[British Humanities Index]], [[CSA (database company)|Worldwide Political Science Abstracts]], [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCOhost]], [[Educational Research Abstracts Online]], [[Multicultural Education Abstracts]], [[New Testament Abstracts]], [[Religious &amp; Theological Abstracts]], [[CSA (database company)#CSA Sociological Abstracts|Sociological Abstracts]], and [[Studies on Women and Gender Abstracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=abstractingIndexing&amp;journalCode=cjcr20|title=Journal of Contemporary Religion|work=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable [[16-bit]] [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#Regular RGB palettes|RGB]] [[palette (computing)|color palettes]], which were primarily manufactured from 1985 to 1995. Due to mixed-bit architectures, the ''n''-bit distinction is not always a strict categorization.

==Atari==

===ST series===
The [[Atari ST]] series has a [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] of 3-bits, eight levels per RGB channel, featuring a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB palette (512 colors)]].
The [[Atari ST#STE|STE]] series has a [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] of 4-bits, sixteen levels per RGB channel, featuring a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB palette (4096 colors)]].

Depending on the (proprietary) monitor type attached, it displays one of the 320×200, 16-colors and 640×200, 4-colors modes with the color monitor, or the high resolution 640×400 black and white mode with the [[monochrome monitor]].

==Commodore==

===Amiga OCS===
The Original Chip Set (OCS) of the [[Commodore Amiga]] features a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB, 4,096-color palette]]. As the Amiga [[Original_Chip_Set#Copper|Copper]] programmable graphics coprocessor is capable of changing color lookup table entries on the fly during display, in practice the number of distinct colors visible on-screen may have exceed static color lookup table sizes documented here.

====5-bit====
The graphic surface is divided in a series of [[Bit-plane|bit planes]], between 1 and 6 for horizontal resolutions of 320 (or up to 384 with overscan), and between 1 and 4 for horizontal resolutions of 640 (or up to 768 with overscan). For either horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution is either 200 (or up to 240 with overscan), or 400 (or up to 480 with overscan) if interlaced, for [[NTSC]]-compatible video modes; or 256 (or up to 288 with overscan), or 512 (or up to 576 with overscan) if interlaced, for [[PAL]]-compatible video modes. The [[CLUT|color lookup table]] has up to 32 entries. So the different indexed color modes are from 1 to 5 bits pixel depth, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16- or 32-color out of 4,096.

|[[Image:Screen color test Amiga 32colors.png]]
|}

====6-bit====
When the sixth bit-plane is used, two extra color modes can be set: [[Extra Half-Brite]] (EHB) and [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM).

In the EHB mode, 6-bits pixel points to one of the 32 colors in the palette with their lower 5-bits, and if the 6th bit is on, the bright of the color is halved (hence the name of this mode). So there are a total of 64 visible colors: the user chooses light versions of the first 32 colors and the system already provides their darker versions.

In the HAM mode, the two higher bits of the 6-bits pixels are used as a four state command. Three of the states changes only the red, green or blue component of the pixel respect of the precedent in the scan line, and hold the other two RGB components. The new value for the modified color component is in the four lower bits. The remaining command state forces the pixel value to be one of the 16 first values of the palette, whose indice is in the four lower bits of the pixel. So it is very important to have a well selected palette, or the color will spread easily among consecutive pixels in the scan line of the image. This mode can display all of the 4,096 colors simultaneously.

==Apple==

===Apple IIgs===
[[Apple IIgs]], along with full compatible graphic modes with the [[Apple II]], features a custom Video Graphics Chip (VGC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byte.com/art/9610/sec4/art2.htm BYTE.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010202554/http://www.byte.com/art/9610/sec4/art2.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB, 4,096-color palette]]. It has an extended set of 320×200 and 640×200 graphic modes, (called Super High-Res modes by Apple) with different (and a bit complex) color modes:
* 320×200 with 16 palettes of 16 selected colors out of 4,096 each. Every single scan line can be assigned to one of the sixteen palettes, so it can have up to 16×16=256 different simultaneous colors (although some common colors like black and white are usually shared among the different palettes, giving fewer than 256 total different colors). The most simple way to use this mode is having a unique 16-color selection for the entire screen and assign it to all scan lines. Here are shown the sample image both using a single shared palette and using all the 16 palettes (in this case, by dividing the image into 16 strips):

:[[Image:Screen color test AppleIIgs 16colors.png]] [[Image:Screen color test AppleIIgs 16x16colors.png]]
* 640×200 with 16 palettes of 8 selected colors out of 4,096 each. Every single scan line can be assigned to one of the sixteen palettes, so it can be have up to 8×16=128 different simultaneous colors (usually less due to shared colors). In a single scan line, even column pixels can have one of the first four colors of the line's assigned palette, and odd column pixels one of the last four colors of the eight. The most simple way to use this mode is having a unique 8-color selection for the entire screen with four duplicate colors (the same to both even and odd pixel columns) and assign it to all scan lines. Here are shown the sample image both with a single shared custom 4-color palette and with a single 8-color palette (black, blue, yellow, white, black again, red, green, white again) to produce 13 dithered-by-hardware colors, ("dark blue" "dark yellow" "gray" "dark red" "magenta" "orange" "light red" "dark green" "cyan" "lime green" "light green" "light blue" and "light yellow") plus pure black and white. The last was the [[Apple GS/OS|Apple IIgs Finder]] default mode and palette.

Also, along with the one of 16 palettes, to each scan line the Apple IIgs VGC is able to assign individual 320 or 640 horizontal resolution independently.

==IBM PC/AT and compatible systems==
:''For the palettes of previous original [[IBM PC]], [[IBM XT]] and [[IBM PCjr]]/[[Tandy 1000]] series hardware displays, please visit [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#IBM PC/XT and compatible systems|IBM PC/XT and compatible systems]] in the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]] article.''

===EGA===
The [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) supports all [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#CGA|CGA modes]] and add three more: two 320×200 and 640×200 graphic modes, both with the full CGA 16-color palette (intended to be used with the same "digital RGB" CGA color monitor of 200 scan lines) and an extra 640×350 graphic mode with 16 colors chosen from a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB (64 colors) palette]] for what IBM then called an "analog RGB" type monitor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"&gt;Richard Wilton, Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, 1987, Microsoft Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''[[analog signal|analog]]'' means here that the RGB signals can have more than the bare two possible levels 0 and 1; (as the so-called —by IBM— "digital RGB" CGA monitor type has) despite of its name, colors are produced digitally, so there exists binary (quantized) steps for every primary RGB signal (two bits, four levels per primary, in this case). Thus, the EGA signal from the computer to this kind of monitor had two wires for each primary red, green and blue. Later, true analog connectors were developed by IBM for the more advanced MCGA and VGA display adapters and monitors, (see the next section) which are unrelated to (and incompatible with) the EGA "analog" monitors.

Some early EGA cards shipped only 64 KiB of video memory, (the nominal was 128KiB, up to a maximum of 256 KiB to allow more screen pages in memory) so the 640×350 graphic mode provides only four colors. This was never a proper mode by itself, and therefore was not popular.

Monochrome "analog" monitors also existed for EGA. The colors are then mapped internally to the correspondent [[Luminance (relative)|luminance]] gray, (the sum of the 30% of the red signal, the 59% of the green and the 11% of the blue) giving a 16-shades from a 64-grayscale palette. "Positive" class monitors inverts the signal, providing that the default EGA colors for text modes (black background and white foreground) displays reversed, (white background and black foreground) as if were a printed document.

===MCGA and VGA===
The [[IBM Multicolor Graphics Adapter|Multicolor Graphics Array]] (MCGA) and [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) used a 6-bits per channel, 64 levels [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] (DAC) to give an [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB palette (262,144 colors)]], from which can be selected any 2, 16, or 256 at a time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"/&gt; They both provided full compatibility with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] modes, while VGA included all the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] modes as well as the MCGA modes. When connected to analog monochrome monitors, they offered 64 levels of grey. Some of the first [[Portable computer|portable PCs]] featured a flat monochrome [[plasma display]] with a VGA in shades of red.

===8514/A and XGA===
The IBM [[8514|8514/A]] uses the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB palette]] from which the user could select any 256 at a time in both 640×480 and 1024×768 graphic modes. It does not support compatibility with VGA modes, but a VGA card is usually already installed and ''bridged'' to the 8514/A to provide a single output cable for a single monitor which can display any of all VGA and 8514/A possible modes.

The [[XGA|eXtended Graphics Array]] (XGA) supports all 8514/A modes plus an 800×600 [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] [[Highcolor]] mode, with 65,536 simultaneous colors on screen.

===Super VGA (SVGA)===
Enhanced clones of the IBM VGA, known as [[Super VGA]], (SVGA) support 256 simultaneous colors in 640×480 and higher pixel resolutions (800×600, 1024×768) in both 16 and 256 picked colors from the VGA [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB palette]], depending on the model and the manufacturer. Also, some SVGA cards support [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] [[Highcolor]] modes, with 32,768 or 65,536 simultaneous colors on screen in 640×480 and higher resolutions. Some later models reach the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] [[True Color|True color]] modes.

In the 1990s, most manufacturers adhered to the [[VESA BIOS Extensions]] (VBE), used for enabling standard support for advanced video modes (at high resolutions and color depths).

They are the direct predecessors, not the IBM 8514/A nor XGA, of actual graphic display PC hardware.

{{homicide}}
 
A '''lust murder''' is a [[homicide]] in which the offender searches for erotic satisfaction by killing someone. ''Lust murder'' is synonymous with the [[paraphilic]] term '''erotophonophilia''', which is [[sexual arousal]] or gratification contingent on the death of a human being. The phrase "lust killing" stems from the original work of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1898 discussion of [[sexual sadism|sadistic]] homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, this type of crime is manifested either by murder during [[sexual activity]], by [[Mutilation|mutilating]] the [[sexual organ]]s or areas of the victim's body, or by murder and mutilation. The mutilation of the victim may include [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], displacement of the sexual organs, or both.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutilation usually takes place postmortem.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010" /&gt; Although the killing sequence may include an act of sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse does not always occur, and other types of sexual acts may be part of the homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Characteristics==
Lust murder sometimes includes activities such as removing clothing from the body, posing and propping of the body in different positions (generally sexual ones), insertion of objects into bodily orifices, [[Cannibalism|anthropophagy]] (the consumption of human blood and/or flesh) and [[necrophilia]] (the performing of sex acts on a human corpse).

Most cases of lust murder involve male perpetrators, although accounts of female lust murderers do exist.&lt;ref name="Female_Lust_Kill"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Women Kill Together. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |work=The Forensic Examiner |publisher=American College of Forensic Examiners Institute (ACFEI) |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829110653/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lust murder is a phenomenon most common among [[serial killers]]. These offenders have made a connection between murder and sexual gratification. When this type of offender chooses a victim there must be something about that victim that the offender finds sexually attractive. This attractive trait might be common among all of the offender's victims and is called the offender's Ideal Victim Type (IVT). There might be many potential targets that an offender passes by because they do not meet their IVT. Once the offender has found a victim who is ideal, they might engage in stalking or other predatory behaviors before acting out their fantasy on their victim. Fantasies are a key component in lust murders and can never be completely fulfilled. The lust killer will have a fantasy that continues to evolve over time and becomes increasingly violent as they struggle to fulfill it.&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Ronald | last1=Holmes | first2= Stephen | last2=Holmes | title=Serial Murder (3rd edition) | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | year=2010 | pages=107–121 |isbn=978-1-4129-7442-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical component in the psychological development of a serial killer is violent fantasy, especially in the lust murderer.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2010). Serial Murderers and Their Victims (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies accompany "intrusive thoughts about killing someone that are associated with other distressing [[psychopathological]] processes".&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Peter B. (2000). The Material Culture of Homicidal Fantasies. Aggressive Behavior, 26, 225-234&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies can never be completely fulfilled; sometimes the experience of killing can generate new fantasies of violence, creating a repetitive cycle. The purpose of fantasy is total control of the victim, whereas a [[sexual assault]] can be used as a vehicle for control. Sexual [[torture]] becomes a tool to degrade, humiliate, and subjugate the victim.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Often victims are selected by the killer to stand as a proxy, resulting from childhood trauma. Fantasies may be fueled by pornography and facilitated by alcohol or other causes.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Typically, fantasies involve one or several forms of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"/&gt;

The term ''lust murder'' is also used in a related, but slightly different sense, to refer to an individual who gains ''[[sexual arousal]]'' from the act of committing murder, or has persistent ''[[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]]'' of committing murder, even if the murder itself does not involve the genital mutilation or other aforementioned characteristics. As such, it is a type of [[paraphilia]].

Although the dynamic of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual's violence fantasy alone is not enough to determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder. Moreover, to conclude that an individual is the murderer because they have drawn multitudes of violent images is overreaching.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2009). “[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/criminal-profiling.pdf When Worlds Collide: Criminal Investigative Analysis, Forensic Psychology And the Timothy Masters Case].” Forensic Examiner, 18:2 NCJ # 226972&lt;/ref&gt; The Perri and Lichtenwald article illustrates the critical importance of homicide detectives employing the Criminal Investigative Analysis model developed by Roy Hazelwood FBI (ret.), profiler and one of the top researchers in the field of lust murders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3810">In [[programming language theory]], a '''non-local variable''' is a variable that is not defined in the local scope. While the term can refer to global variables, it is primarily used in the context of [[nested function|nested]] and [[anonymous function]]s where some variables can be neither in the [[local scope|local]] nor the [[global scope]].

In [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] they are called the ''upvalues'' of the function.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html  Programming in Lua (first edition)],'' "[http://www.lua.org/pil/27.3.3.html 27.3.3 – Upvalues]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples == &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These examples suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
=== Nested functions === &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These two examples  suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
In the Python 3 example that follows there is a nested function &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; defined in the scope of another function &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is local to &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt;, but non-local to &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; (nor is it global):
&lt;source lang=python3&gt;
def outer():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x += 1
        print(x)
    return inner
&lt;/source&gt;

In Javascript, the locality of a variable is determined by the closest &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; statement for this variable. In the following example, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is local to &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt; as it contains a &lt;code&gt; var x&lt;/code&gt; statement, while &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; doesn't. Therefore, x is non-local to &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
function outer() {
    var x = 1;
    function inner() {
        x += 1;
        console.log(x);
    }
    return inner;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Anonymous functions === &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These examples suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
In the Haskell example that follows the variable &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is non-local in the anonymous function &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; x + c&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
outer = let c = 1 in map (\x -&gt; x + c) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Implementation issues ==
{{see also|Nested function#Implementation|Man or boy test}}
Non-local variables are the primary reason it is difficult to support nested, anonymous, [[higher-order function|higher-order]] and thereby [[first-class function]]s in a programming language.

If the nested function or functions are (mutually) [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]], it becomes hard for the [[compiler]] to know exactly where on the [[call stack]] the non-local variable was allocated, as the [[frame pointer]] only points to the local variable of the nested function itself and there can be an arbitrary number of [[activation record]]s on the stack in between. This is generally solved using [[access link]]s or [[display register]]s.

If the nested function is passed as an argument to a higher-order function a [[closure (computer science)|closure]] needs to be built in order to locate the non-local variables. If the nested function is returned as a result from its outer function (or stored in a variable) the non-local variables will no longer be available on the stack. They need to be heap allocated instead, and their lifetime extend beyond the lifetime of the outer function that declared and allocated them. This generally requires garbage-collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">The '''patriarchal age''' is the era of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], according to the narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the [[primeval history]] and followed by [[The Exodus]].

==Jewish tradition==
The Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] date the birth of [[Abraham]] to 1948 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] (c. 1813 BCE)&lt;ref name="abraham_jvl"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/abraham.html Jewish Virtual Library: Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; and place the death of [[Jacob]] in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).

==Biblical criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
History known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of [[biblical criticism]] in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] existed before then, but with the development of the [[documentary hypothesis]] – the theory that the [[Pentateuch]], including the [[Book of Genesis]], was composed not by [[Moses]] but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.

==Early biblical archaeology==
Out of this heated debate between the various theories of [[biblical criticism]] and traditional, religious interpretations was born [[biblical archaeology]], a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.

The most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was [[William F. Albright]], who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate [[Bronze Age]], the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient [[Canaan]]. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|sudden collapse]] of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the northeast whom he identified with the [[Amorites]] mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, [[E. A. Speiser]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]] argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: "We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, "History of Israel", 1972, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblical archaeology==
Albright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent [[anachronism]]s in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters [[Philistines]], who (according to archaeology{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.&lt;ref name="rashi_ber2"&gt;For instance, the classic tenth-century commentator [[Rashi]] notes that the Bible sometimes refers to places according to the names that later peoples created for them, as in his comment on Gen. 2:14: "Cush and Assyria: As yet they did not exist and Scripture wrote [using] their future names." Similarly in chapter 21, the Bible never actually calls Abimelech and his subjects "Philistines," but only says that they returned to "the land [that would become that] of the Philistines."&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated [[camel]] bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news| last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–285 |url= http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014 |doi= 10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;Heide, Martin. 2011 "The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">The '''Pickering series''' (also known as the '''Pickering&amp;ndash;Fowler series''') consists of three lines of singly [[ionized]] [[helium]] found, usually in absorption, in the spectra of hot stars like [[Wolf-Rayet star]]s. The name comes from [[Edward Charles Pickering]]&lt;ref name = Robotti /&gt; and [[Alfred Fowler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|first = Imre|last = Lakatos|authorlink = Imre Lakatos|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1980|isbn = 9780521280310|editor1-first = John|editor1-last = Worrall|editor2-first = Gregory|editor2-last = Currie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C&amp;pg=PA62|chapter = Bohr: A Research Programme Progressing on Inconsistent Foundations|pages = 55-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The lines are produced by transitions from a higher energy level of an electron to a level with [[principal quantum number]] ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4. The lines have wavelengths:

*4551&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)
*5411&amp;nbsp;Å (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)
*10123&amp;nbsp;Å (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)

The transitions from the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 states overlap with [[hydrogen]] lines and are not seen in stellar spectra.

In 1896, Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star [[Puppis|&amp;zeta;-Puppis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Pickering|first = E.

'''ProLiteracy''', also known as '''ProLiteracy Worldwide''', is an international [[nonprofit]] organization based in [[Syracuse, N.Y.]], that supports programs that help adults learn to read and write. It is the largest adult literacy and basic education membership organization in the United States. ProLiteracy has over 800 member programs in the U.S. and is active in 20 developing countries&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: Get Involved. [https://www.proliteracy.org/Get-Involved/Become-a-Member/ProLiteracy-Member-Organizations "ProLiteracy Member Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: What We Do.

==History==
[[File:George W. Bush and Ruth Johnson Colvin.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Ruth Johnson Colvin with President [[George W. Bush]] receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on Friday, Dec. 15, 2006]]

ProLiteracy was formed when Laubach Literacy International and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged in 2002.

Laubach Literacy International’s history began in 1930, when [[Frank Laubach|Dr. Frank C. Laubach]] was a [[missionary]] among the [[Maranao]] people of the [[Philippines]]. His concern about their poor living conditions led him to conclude that the ability to read and write was essential for them to begin to solve their problems. As the Maranaos learned to read, they would, in turn, teach other adults on a one-to-one basis that became known as “Each One Teach One.” From 1935 to 1967, Dr. Laubach visited 105 countries answering calls for literacy help and created reading lessons in 315 languages. He founded Laubach Literacy International in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1955.

For years, [[literacy]] as a global mission interested [[Ruth Johnson Colvin]]. She had heard Dr. Laubach speak about [[literacy|illiteracy]] in faraway countries, but she didn’t consider it a problem in [[United States|America]]. So she was shocked when she read a 1961 Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper article that stated there were over 11,000 people in her county who could not read or write well (based on 1960 U.S. Census figures). She began speaking with local [[social service]] agencies, community leaders, and church groups about the problem. With the help of reading experts, she developed a means to train volunteers to tutor adults. In 1962, she started Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc.&lt;ref name="proliteracy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proliteracy.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=3 |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |title=Ruth J.

== Mission==
ProLiteracy believes every adult has a right to literacy. ProLiteracy develops and promotes adult literacy learning, content, programs and advocacy to help adult learners.

==Overview==
ProLiteracy’s Programs division works in the U.S. and around the world. ProLiteracy has [[grassroots]] partner programs in developing countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Middle East]]. ProLiteracy provides training, technical assistance, and targeted local grants to support tailored programs that combine literacy with economic self-reliance, [[health]], [[education]], [[peace]], [[human rights]], and [[environmental sustainability]] projects.

In the U.S., ProLiteracy represents over 800 community-based [[Volunteering|volunteer]] and adult basic education affiliates in 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. ProLiteracy accredits programs and supports them with technical assistance and program and professional development services online, in regional trainings, and at a biennial conference. ProLiteracy also serves as an advocate for issues related to adult literacy and lifelong learning.

New Readers Press, ProLiteracy’s publishing house, generates $7 million in revenue annually through the sale of materials used in teaching adults and older teens. Proceeds from these sales support the services that ProLiteracy offers to literacy practitioners. News for You, published by New Readers Press, is a weekly online and print news source for English language learners and basic literacy students.

==Programs==
The National Book Fund (NBF) gives grants of New Readers Press books and materials directly to local literacy service providers. The NBF provides books for family literacy programs that work with parents and children, English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) programs, adult basic education initiatives, and women-focused programming.

ProLiteracy began its Women In Literacy (WIL) initiative in 1991 in response to the particular needs of women. Cultural traditions and local laws often favor men, allowing them access to education, property, employment, health care, and participation in government that is denied to women. ProLiteracy's Women in Literacy initiative gives women the literacy skills they need to understand and change their daily lives. Women hold key leadership positions in more than 80 percent of WIL partner programs.

==Funding==
About 60 percent of ProLiteracy’s funding comes from sales of its educational materials. About 35 percent comes from private sources, including individuals, corporations, and foundations. The remainder comes from affiliate dues and investment income.

In 2011, more than 81 percent of donor contributions were allocated to program expenses.

==Accountability Standards==
A 2017 report by the [[Better Business Bureau|Better Business Bureau's]] [[Wise Giving Alliance]] (WGA) found that ProLiteracy met all of its standards for charity accountability. The WGA found that ProLiteracy is truthful in its representations of how money is spent, does not allocate an excessive part of its budget for fundraising or administrative expenses, and makes its financial statements readily available to the public.

==Financial Turmoil, Downsizing, and Recovery==
From 2009 to 2013, under then-President and CEO David C. Harvey, ProLiteracy faced severe financial issues, with a $1.8 million shortfall and a $1.7 million loss in net assets in 2012&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moving their headquarters to a revitalized warehouse and investing in the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community were contributing factors in the shortfall, including its newly-opened Ruth J. Colvin Center for Innovation and Excellence in Adult Literacy, a public computer lab designed to teach adults computer literacy&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Maureen (28 May 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/proliteracy_moves_into_new_dig.html "ProLiteracy moves into new digs on Syracuse's Near West Side"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Six months after the move to ProLiteracy's new headquarters, Harvey resigned as President and CEO. Kevin J. Morgan, Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2009, stated that Harvey "went on to pursue other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area, and let's leave it at that"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/proliteracy_ceo_resigns_chairm.html "ProLiteracy CEO leaves; chairman of the board named interim director"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite likely being a significant contributing factor to the financial mismanagement leading to the crisis, Harvey himself purported to have "Led a turn-around operation for a $9 million international organization" during said pursuit of "other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (28 May 2013). Blogspot.com. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140210231628/http://davidharveyproliteracy.blogspot.com "David C. Harvey: Seeking Interim Executive Positions, Consultancies"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Harvey has been the Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors since 2016&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition of STD Directors (2018). [http://www.ncsddc.org/about/our-staff/ "Our Staff"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Morgan, who received his graduate degree in marketing from [[DeVry University]], was appointed Interim President and CEO, dividing his time between ProLiteracy and Full Suspension Marketing, a small, Utah-based startup and marketing agency he founded in 2007&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-morgan-280b28/ "Kevin Morgan, President and CEO at ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UtahDB. [https://utahdb.com/company/6468908-0142/full-suspension-marketing-inc.html "Full Suspension Marketing"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utah's Right to Know. [http://www.utahsright.com/employers.php?county=summit&amp;order=Industry&amp;oType=ASC&amp;page=28 "Utah's Largest Employers"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ProLiteracy Board of Directors then "formed a search committee for a new president and CEO," said Morgan, concluding that "sometimes it happens quickly, other times it may take some time, depending on who you talk to"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite raising over $1 million in charitable donations to refurbish ProLiteracy's new headquarters in the midst of the crisis, it faced yet another shortfall of $1.2 million in 2013, receiving a 1-star rating on [[Charity Navigator]] following nearly a decade of fluctuating between 1- and 2-stars, prompting Harvey's 2010 public criticism of the charity watchdog as an "imperfect way to assess" &lt;ref&gt;Salt District (11 Jul 2012). [http://www.saltdistrict.com/2012/07/wcny/ "ProLiteracy Moves to Case Supply"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&amp;orgid=4007 "Historical Records for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (31 Oct 2010). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2010/10/new_york_post-standard_endorse.html "New York, Post-Standard endorsements, United Way, Charity Navigator, ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During the following fiscal year, ProLiteracy downsized considerably, laying off the majority of its full-time staff and shutting down budding investments into the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/company/proliteracy-worldwide/ "ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, ProLiteracy significantly reduced its international involvement from 30 to 20 countries&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (01 Apr 2012). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2012/04/ubuntu_on_the_near_west_side_l.html "Ubuntu on the Near West Side: 'Literacy for Social Change' comes home to Syracuse"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: What We Do. [https://www.proliteracy.org/What-We-Do/Programs-Projects/International "International Programs"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, ProLiteracy ended its 2014 fiscal year with $3 million in revenues less expenses and nearly double their net assets, from $3.3 to $6.3 million&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The search committee dissolved, as did Morgan's marketing agency, and he remains President and CEO to this day&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (2018). [https://proliteracy.org/About-Us/Leadership/Staff "About Us: Leadership"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, ProLiteracy was awarded its first 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, a composite of a 3-star rating in financial health and 4-star rating in accountability and transparency&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4007 "Rating for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Public Analysts''' are scientists in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] whose principal task is to ensure the safety and correct description of food by testing for compliance with legislation.&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;[http://www.publicanalystdublin.ie/en/ Public Analyst's Laboratory, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Public Analysts are also Agricultural Analysts who carry out similar work on animal feedingstuffs and fertilisers.&lt;ref name=AgAct&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1970/pdf/ukpga_19700040_en.pdf Agriculture Act 1970, CHAPTER 40]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays this includes checking that the food labelling is accurate. They also test drinking water, and may carry out chemical and biological tests on other consumer products.&lt;ref name=UKPAS&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/News/Adjournment_Debate/The_Public_Analyst_Service_April_2009.pdf The Public Analyst Service]&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the work is done by other scientists and technicians in the laboratory, the Public Analyst has legal responsibility for the accuracy of the work and the validity of any opinion expressed on the results reported. There is an [http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts], which includes members with similar roles if different titles in other countries.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The office of Public Analyst was established in 1860, with the Act for Preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food and Drink, the first three appointments being in [[London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;  Since the separation of the UK and Ireland, they operate under different legislation, but the term and general duties are the same.  The original work was chemical testing, and this is still a major part, but nowadays microbiological examination of food is an important activity, particularly in Scotland, where Public Analyst laboratories also carry out a statutory Food Examiner role.

==UK==
The primary UK legislation is the [[Food Safety Act 1990]].   All local authorities are required to appoint a Public Analyst,&lt;ref name=FSA1990S27&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/ukpga_19900016_en_5#pt3-pb1-l1g27]&lt;/ref&gt; although there have always been fewer Public Analysts and their laboratories than local authorities, most being shared by a number of local authorities. On the UK mainland there has always been a mixture of public sector and private sector laboratories. This remains the case today - but they all provide an equivalent service, and avoidance of conflicts of interest are ensured by the statutory terms of appointment. There is a statutory qualification requirement&lt;ref name=SI2463&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902463_en_1.htm Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2463 The Food Safety (Sampling and Qualifications) Regulations 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; for Public Analysts, known as the Mastership in Chemical Analysis (MChemA), awarded by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].  This is a specialist postgraduate qualification by examination that verifies knowledge and understanding of food and its potential defects, interpretation of food law, and the application and interpretation of chemical analysis for food law enforcement.

The Public Analysts’ laboratories must be third-party accredited to [[British Standard]] ISO 17025.&lt;ref name=ISO17025&gt;International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 - ''General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories''  [[British Standards Institution|BSI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1980s there were some 40 Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK with over 100 appointed Public Analysts.  By 1993 that had reduced to 34 Laboratories and around 80 Public Analysts, and by 2010 the number of Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK had reduced to 22&lt;ref name=PALabs&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/The_Laboratories/the_laboratories.html]&lt;/ref&gt; with only about 26 Public Analysts.

Enforcement of food law in the UK is by local authorities, principally their [[environmental health|environmental health officers]] and [[Trading Standards Institute|trading standards officers]].  Whilst these officers are empowered to take samples of food, the actual assessment in terms of chemical analysis or microbiological examination and subsequent interpretation that are necessary to determine whether a food complies with legislation is carried out by Public Analysts and Food Examiners respectively, scientists whose qualifications and experience are specified by regulations.

==Ireland==
Public Analyst Laboratories in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Dublin and [[Galway]] provide an analytical service to the Food Safety Authority.&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;

==Practice==
The Public Analyst runs a laboratory which will:
* Analyse food:
** for composition: many foods have legally defined, customary or expected  compositions
** for [[food additive|additives]]: which must be legally permitted and within prescribed concentrations
** for [[Food contaminants|contamination]]: chemical, [[Microbiology|microbiological]]
** to assess the accuracy of labelling
** to investigate whether complaints by the public are justified
* Interpret relevant law passed by the [[European Union|EU]] and UK or Ireland:
** act as [[expert witness]] in prosecutions

In addition to their central rôle in relation to food law enforcement, Public Analysts provide expert scientific support to local authorities and the private sector in various other areas, for example they:
* analyse [[drinking water|drinking]], bathing water including swimming pools, industrial effluents, industrial process waters and other waters
* investigate environmental products and processes including assessing land contamination, building materials and examining fuels 
* advise on [[waste management]]
* investigate and monitor [[air pollution]]
* advise on consumer safety - in particular consumer products such as toys
* monitor asbestos and other hazards
* carry out toxicological work to assist HM Coroners

== Sampling ==
Sampling is largely outside the control of the Public Analyst.

Local authorities have a duty to check the safety of food and to provide adequate protection of the consumer. To achieve that they devise sampling plans, seeking to balance their need to monitor food against limited resources and other demands on their budgets. A typical sampling plan for a local authority might include samples of the following:

* samples from a particular source - a supermarket, manufacturer or caterer or country
* meat products - to check %meat or %fat or non-meat  or additives or species
* product marketing claims
* undeclared ingredients in prepared foods
* contaminated products
* nutritional content of prepared meals

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6114">The '''R* rule''' (also called the '''resource-ratio hypothesis''') is a hypothesis in [[community ecology]] that attempts to predict which species will become dominant as the result of [[competitive exclusion|competition for resources]].&lt;ref name=tilman1982&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilman|first1=David|title=Resource competition and community structure|date=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691083025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It predicts that if multiple species are competing for a single limiting resource, then whichever species can survive at the lowest equilibrium resource level (i.e., the R*) can outcompete all other species.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;  If two species are competing for two resources, then coexistence is only possible if each species has a lower R* on one of the resources.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;  For example, two [[phytoplankton]] species may be able to coexist if one is more limited by nitrogen, and the other is more limited by phosphorus.

A large number of experimental studies have attempted to verify the predictions of the R* rule.  Many studies have shown that when multiple plankton are grown together, the species with the lowest R* will dominate, or coexist if they are limited by multiple resources.&lt;ref name="grover1997" /&gt;  There are fewer tests of the R* rule in communities of larger organisms, in part because of the difficulty of creating a situation in which only a single resource is limiting.&lt;ref name="grover1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller_etal2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Burns|first2=Jean H.|last3=Munguia|first3=Pablo|last4=Walters|first4=Eric L.|last5=Kneitel|first5=Jamie M.|last6=Richards|first6=Paul M.|last7=Mouquet|first7=Nicolas|last8=Buckley|first8=Hannah L.|title=A Critical Review of Twenty Years’ Use of the Resource‐Ratio Theory|journal=The American Naturalist|date=April 2005|volume=165|issue=4|pages=439–448|doi=10.1086/428681|pmid=15791536}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some studies have used the R* rule with multiple resources to predict which groups of plants will be able to coexist.&lt;ref name=dybzinski2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dybzinski|first1=Ray|last2=Tilman|first2=David|title=Resource Use Patterns Predict Long‐Term Outcomes of Plant Competition for Nutrients and Light|journal=The American Naturalist|date=September 2007|volume=170|issue=3|pages=305–318|doi=10.1086/519857|pmid=17879183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical Derivation==
Consider a community with multiple species.  We will assume that each species competes for a single resource, and ignore the effects of interference or apparent competition.  Each population increases by consuming resources, and declines when resources are too scarce.  For example, we could model their population dynamics as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_j}{dt} = N_j(a_j R - d) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = r - R\sum_j a_jN_j &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of species ''j'', ''R'' is the density of the resource, ''a'' is the rate at which species ''j'' eats the resource, ''d'' is species ''j''s death rate, and ''r'' is the rate at which resources grow when not consumed.  It is easy to show that when species ''j'' is at equilibrium by itself (i.e., ''dN&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'' = 0), that the equilibrium resource density, ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', is

&lt;math&gt;R^*_j = d/a_j.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''R'' &gt; ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', species j's population will increase; when ''R'' is less than ''R*&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', species ''j''s population will decline.  Because of this, the species with the lowest ''R*'' will eventually dominate.  Consider the two species case, where ''R*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''R*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.  When species 2 is at equilibrium, ''R'' = ''R*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and species 1's population will be increasing.  When species 1 is at equilibrium, ''R'' = ''R*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and species 2's population will be decreasing.&lt;ref name="tilman1982" /&gt;

This method has been extended to analyze more complex models, such as species with a [[functional response|Type II functional response]].  Under many additional circumstances, the above result still holds: the species who can survive at the lowest resource levels will be the competitive dominant.&lt;ref name=grover1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grover|first1=James P.|title=Resource competition|date=1997|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|location=London|isbn=0412749300|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the CSR triangle theory==
Understanding the differences between the R* theory and its major alternative the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR triangle theory]] is a major goal in [[community ecology]] for many years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craine|first1=Joseph|title=Reconciling plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01043.x|volume=93|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=1041–1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jabot|title=general modelling framework for resource-ratio and CSR theories of plant community dynamics|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02024.x | volume=100|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=1296–1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the R* theory, the CSR theory predicts that competitive ability is determined by [[relative growth rate]] and other size related traits. While some experiments supported the R* predictions, other supported the CSR predictions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
The different predictions stem from different assumptions on the [[size-asymmetric competition|size asymmetry of the competition]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size symmetric (i.e. resource exploitation is proportional to individual biomass), the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric (i.e. large individuals exploit disproportional higher amounts of resources compared with smaller individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMalach|title=Size asymmetry of resource competition and the structure of plant communities|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12557 | volume=104|journal=Journal of Ecology|pages=899–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiometry''' is a set of techniques for [[measurement|measuring]] [[electromagnetic radiation]], including [[visible light]]. Radiometric techniques in [[optics]] characterize the distribution of the radiation's [[power (physics)|power]] in space, as opposed to [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] techniques, which characterize the light's interaction with the human eye. Radiometry is distinct from [[quantum optics|quantum]] techniques such as [[photon]] counting.

The use of [[radiometer]]s to determine the temperature of objects and gasses by measuring radiation flux is called [[pyrometry]].  Handheld pyrometer devices are often marketed as [[infrared thermometer]]s.

Radiometry is important in [[astronomy]], especially [[radio astronomy]], and plays a significant role in [[Earth remote sensing]]. The measurement techniques categorized as ''radiometry'' in optics are called [[Photometry (astronomy)|''photometry'']] in some astronomical applications, contrary to the optics usage of the term.

'''Spectroradiometry''' is the measurement of absolute radiometric quantities in narrow bands of wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=[[Focal Press]] | author=Leslie D. Stroebel | author2=Richard D. Zakia | last-author-amp=yes | date=1993 | edition=3rd|page=115 |isbn=0-240-51417-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=spectroradiometry+intitle:%22Focal+Encyclopedia+of+Photography%22#PPA115,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiometric quantities ==
{{SI radiometry units}}

== Integral and spectral radiometric quantities ==
[[Integral]] quantities (like [[radiant flux]]) describe the total effect of radiation of all [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], while [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] quantities (like [[spectral power]]) describe the effect of radiation of a single wavelength ''λ'' or frequency ''ν''. To each integral quantity there are corresponding spectral quantities, for example the radiant flux Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the spectral power Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; and Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Getting an integral quantity's spectral counterpart requires a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit transition]]. This comes from the idea that the precisely requested wavelength [[photon]] existence probability is zero. Let us show the relation between them using the radiant flux as an example:

Integral flux, whose unit is [[watt|W]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Spectral flux by wavelength, whose unit is {{nobreak|W/[[metre|m]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = {\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e} \over \mathrm{d}\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small wavelength interval [''λ'', ''λ'' + d''λ''].
The area under a plot with wavelength horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

Spectral flux by frequency, whose unit is {{nobreak|W/[[hertz|Hz]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = {\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e} \over \mathrm{d}\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small frequency interval [''ν'', ''ν'' + d''ν''].
The area under a plot with frequency horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

The spectral quantities by wavelength ''λ'' and frequency ''ν'' are related to each other, since the product of the two variables is the [[speed of light]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda \cdot \nu = c&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = {c \over \lambda^2} \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu},&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = {c \over \nu^2} \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda},&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \nu \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral quantity can be obtained by the spectral quantity's integration:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \int_0^\infty \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\, \mathrm{d}\lambda = \int_0^\infty \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}\, \mathrm{d}\nu = \int_0^\infty \lambda \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\, \mathrm{d} \ln \lambda = \int_0^\infty \nu \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}\, \mathrm{d} \ln \nu.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">'''Reading Specialist Certification''' is required to serve as a reading specialist in [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[high school]]s.  Reading specialists are professionals who aim to improve reading achievement in their district or school by serving as [[teacher]]s, coaches, or leaders of school reading programs.&lt;ref name="reading.org"&gt;http://www.reading.org/General/CurrentResearch/Standards/ProfessionalStandards2010/ProfessionalStandards2010_Role5.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The reading specialist is authorized to teach reading and to provide [[technical assistance]] and [[professional development]] to teachers.  The reading specialist also supports, supplements and extends classroom teaching, and works collaboratively to implement a quality reading program that is research-based and meets the needs of students.

== Individual state standards ==

Certification generally involves completing [[literacy]]-related [[coursework]] after one has obtained a [[bachelor's degree]].  Each state has different criteria for obtaining reading specialist certification.  Some states require general [[teacher certification]], and some require at least one year of teaching experience in a general [[classroom]], before obtaining reading specialist certification.   It may be issued as a full certificate or as an endorsement on an existing teaching certificate.   Some states require applicants to pass a reading specialist content area examination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isbe.state.il.us/certification/requirements/toc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Reading Association standards ==

The [[International Reading Association]] has its own standards for reading specialists, which they also term literacy coaches.  They posit that a reading specialist must have valid teaching certification, teaching experience, and a master's degree with concentration in reading and writing education.  The International Reading Association also believes that reading specialists should undergo coursework that builds skills and knowledge that would result in ability to take on [[leadership]] skills with the school reading program, fostering knowledge among staff and students.  In addition, the Association recommends that specialists seeking certification should complete 21–27 hours of [[language arts]], reading, and other related courses at the graduate level.  They state that the graduate-level coursework should include a [[practicum]] with a supervisor, recommended to be 6 semester hours.&lt;ref name="reading.org"/&gt; The supervised practicum experience should require working with students who struggle with reading, as well as collaborative and coaching experiences with teachers.

== U.S. Department of Education standards ==

The [[U.S. Department of Education]] facilitates learning more about state-specific certification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://teach.gov/become-teacher/licensing-and-certification&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of university standards ==

An alternate view of Reading Specialist Certification is provided by several universities.  At [[Northeastern Illinois University]] and [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicanu.com/reading-specialist-certificate-teacher-endorsement/&lt;/ref&gt; accredited by the International Reading Association, students undergo 36 graduate semester hours to earn a Master of Arts in Reading degree, along with reading specialist certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neiu.edu/~readdept/Graduate_Reading_Program.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], applicants must complete 39 [[course credit]] hours, resulting in a [[graduate degree]]: Language, Literacy, and Culture M.Ed. degree, along with reading specialist certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.uic.edu/llc-med/degreerequirements.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], a '''reduction''' is an [[arrangement]] or [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of an existing [[sheet music|score]] or [[musical composition|composition]] in which complexity is lessened to make [[musical analysis|analysis]], performance, or practice easier or clearer; the number of [[part (music)|parts]] may be reduced or [[rhythm]] may be simplified, such as through the use of [[block chord]]s.

==Orchestral==

An '''orchestral reduction''' is a [[sheet music]] arrangement of a work originally for full symphony [[orchestra]] (such as a symphony, overture, or opera), rearranged for a single instrument (typically [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]), a smaller orchestra, or a [[chamber ensemble]] with or without a keyboard (e.g. a [[string quartet]]). A reduction for solo piano is sometimes called a [[#Piano|piano reduction]] or ''piano score''.

During opera rehearsals, a [[répétiteur]] (piano player) will typically read from a piano reduction of the opera. When a choir is learning a work scored for choir and full orchestra, the initial rehearsals will usually be done with a pianist playing a piano reduction of the orchestra part. Before the advent of the [[phonograph]], arrangements of orchestral works for solo piano or [[piano four hands]] were in common use for enjoyment at home.

A reduction for a smaller orchestra or chamber ensemble may be used when not enough players are available, when a venue is too small to accommodate the full orchestra, to accompany less powerful voices, or to save money by hiring fewer players.

==Piano==
&lt;!--[[Piano transcription]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
A '''piano reduction''' or '''piano transcription''' is [[sheet music]] for the [[piano]] (a ''piano score'') that has been compressed and/or simplified so as to fit on a two-line staff and be playable on the piano. It is also considered a style of [[orchestration]] or music [[arrangement]] less well known as ''contraction scoring'', a subset of [[elastic scoring]].

The most notable example is [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|transcriptions]] for solo piano of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s symphonies, which are arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Reflections_on_Liszt.html?id=4URhKNWu0XQC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], a piano reduction should "only be like the view of a sculpture from ''one'' viewpoint", and he advises that [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|thickness]] should largely be ignored, since "the attempt to make a useful object equally usable for a variety of purposes is usually the way to spoil it completely".&lt;ref name="The Modern Piano Reduction"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Arnold |year=1975 |chapter=The Modern Piano Reduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbXtxJezk5cC&amp;pg=PA348 |title=Style and Idea: Selected Writings of Arnold Schoenberg |pages=348–350 |isbn=978-0-520-05294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tsubakurodake from Otenshodake 2002-8-22.jpg|thumb|A mountain ridge in Japan]]
[[File:Bristol tenn ridgelines2.jpg|thumb|A stratigraphic ridge within the Appalachian Mountains.]]
[[File:The Table1.jpg|thumb|The edges of [[tuya]]s can form ridges.]]


A '''ridge''' or a '''mountain ridge'''  is a geological feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for some distance. The sides of the ridge slope away from narrow top on either side.The line along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, is called the '''ridgeline'''. Ridges are usually termed [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s as well, depending on size.

==Types==
There are several main types of ridges:

*[[Dendritic drainage|Dendritic]] ridge: In typical [[dissected plateau]] terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more [[erosion]] resistant rock, but not always – they often remain because there were more [[Joint (geology)|joint]]s where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences.  This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top.
*Stratigraphic ridge: In places such as the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], long, even, straight ridges are formed because they are the uneroded remaining edges of the more resistant [[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[stratum|strata]] that were [[Fold (geology)|folded]] laterally.  Similar ridges have formed in places such as the [[Black Hills]], where the ridges form concentric circles around the [[igneous]] core.  Sometimes these ridges are called "[[Hogback (geology)|hogback ridges]]".
*[[Mid ocean ridge|Oceanic spreading ridge]]: In [[tectonic]] spreading zones around the world, such as at the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the volcanic activity forming new plate boundary forms volcanic ridges at the spreading zone.  [[Isostasy|Isostatic]] settling and erosion gradually reduces the elevations moving away from the zone.
*Crater ridges: Large [[meteorite]] strikes typically form large [[impact crater]]s bordered by circular ridges.
*Volcanic crater/caldera ridges: Large [[volcano]]es often leave behind a central [[volcanic crater|crater]]/[[caldera]] bordered by circular ridges.
*Fault ridges: [[Fault (geology)|Faults]] often form [[escarpment]]s.  Sometimes the tops of the escarpments form not plateaus but slope back so that the edges of the escarpments form ridges.
*Dune ridges: In areas of large-scale [[dune]] activity, certain types of dunes result in [[sand]] ridges.
*Moraines and eskers: [[Glacier|Glacial]] activity may leave ridges in the form of [[moraine]]s and [[esker]]s. An [[arête]] is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.
*Volcanic subglacial ridges: Many [[subglacial volcano]]es create ridge-like formations when [[lava]] erupts through a thick [[glacier]] or [[ice sheet]].
*[[Shutter ridge]]s: A shutter ridge is a ridge which has moved along a fault line, blocking or diverting drainage. Typically, a shutter ridge creates a valley corresponding to the alignment of the fault that produces it.

The '''Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train''' was a unique unit of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It was active only during the [[World War I|First World War]], where it served in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]s. The Train was formed in February 1915 and stood down in May 1917. Throughout its existence, it was composed of [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|Royal Australian Naval Reservists]] under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Leighton Bracegirdle]]. Normally under the command of the [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|British IX Corps]], the Train also supported the [[I ANZAC Corps]] and [[Imperial Camel Corps]] in the defence of the [[Suez Canal]]. {{quote|They were the only Australian naval unit serving in a European theatre of war. They were therefore bent on proving, both to the Royal Navy and to the British Army, that they could overcome any difficulties.&lt;ref name="only naval unit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=396|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Lt Commander Bracegirdle|Officer Commanding, RAN Bridging Train}} The Train was Australia's most decorated naval unit of the First World War, with more than 20 decorations awarded to its sailors.

==Formation and recruitment==
By 1915, with the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force|prompt seizure]] of [[German colonial empire|Germany's pacific possessions]], it was becoming apparent that there would be very little for the [[Royal Australian Naval Brigade]] to do beyond securing Australia's ports. It was also becoming obvious that [[Trench Warfare]] was going to be the main feature of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and that [[Combat engineers|engineering units]] were in strong demand. Reports reached Australia that the even a Naval contingent would be acceptable, as the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]], consisting of [[Royal Marines]] and Naval Reservists, was preparing to join the Western Front.
Naval Board was quick to move of these reports, making this recommendation to the Minister for Defence: {{quote|The Naval Board, having consulted the Chief of the General Staff as to most suitable method by which services of [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|RANR]] officers and men can be made use of in the present war, propose that an offer be made to the Home Government to supply two Bridging Trains, completed to war establishment, the same to be manned by naval ratings drawn mainly from ranks of RANR It is proposed that, while retaining naval ranks and ratings in all other respects, the men comprising these trains should be paid, organised, equipped, and trained under military supervision.&lt;ref name="Official History 382"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=382|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Navy Board recommendation|Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX}}
On 12 February, the Government made the offer to the Imperial Government to provide one Bridging Train, in accordance with "Imperial War Establishments." Within a week, the offer was accepted.&lt;ref name="argus train-offer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1497837 |title=Australia's Aid – Bridging Train Offered – War Office Accepts |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=20 February 1915 |accessdate=17 May 2013 |page=18 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAN-Bridge-Train-staff.jpg|thumb|right|The RANBT Staff circa 1915.]] Command of the Train was given to [[Leighton Seymour Bracegirdle|Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle]], with Lieutenant (later, Commander) Thomas Bond {{post-nominals|country=AUS|DSO|VD|RANR}} as his [[Second-in-command|First Lieutenant]]. Both officers had been involved in the surrender of [[German New Guinea]], Bond had led  the attack on the wireless station, and Bracegirdle had been left in command of the garrison when Commander Beresford was evacuated for medical treatment.&lt;ref name="A Bridging Train"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60751123 |title=A Bridging Train. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 March 1915 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two officers were appointed on 24 February 1915.

The Train grew to 115 men by 12 March and was encamped on [[Kings Domain, Melbourne]]. Bracegirdle and Bond had also discovered that no one left in Australian in either the Army or the Navy had any useful knowledge on the subject of bridging trains, they would have to wait for their pontoons and vehicles to be built – meaning a wait of at least six weeks before they would be able to begin training, and that almost all of their unit would need to be taught to ride, on very few horses.

The Train embarked upon ''HMAT A39 Port MacQuarie'' on 3 June with, according to the Train's Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Morris,&lt;ref name="doc's numbers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59897082 |title=Royal Naval Bridging Train – Chat With Medical Officer|newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=3 February 1917 |accessdate=17 May 2013 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 officers, 3 [[warrant officer]]s, 267 [[Petty Officer]]s and [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]], 26 reinforcements, 412 horses, 5 6-horse pontoons and tressle waggons, and 8 other vehicles. They were headed to Chatham, England to be trained in the construction of pontoons. Of course, this was the First World War. The Train reached [[Port Said|Port Said, Egypt]] on 17 July 1915, and was issued orders to continue on to England. The next day, the 18th, they received orders to [[Dardanelles Campaign|the Dardanelles]]. Arriving at the Greek isle of [[Imbros]], yet more new orders were received, transferring control of the Train from the [[British Admiralty]], which had been given operational control of the Royal Australian Navy by the Federal Government on 10 August 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munro Ferguson|first1=Ronald|title=Proclamation Transferring the Australian Navy to Admiralty Control|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1069929/|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[British Army]] and attaching it to [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Army Corps]] under [[Frederick Stopford|Lt. General Stopford]] which was to [[Landing at Suvla Bay|land at Suvla Bay]] on 7 August.

While at Imbros, the Train received a grand total of five days of instruction on the use of their pontoons, a task which needed six days worth of unloading and reloading the equipment. After this minimal training, they were considered ready to land under enemy fire.

==Suvla Bay==
{{main|Landing at Suvla Bay}}
{{cquote|If you want to see their good works you have only to go to Kangaroo Beach, Suvla Bay and look around you. They have made a harbour.}}
[[File:AWM P01326.008 - RAN Bridging Train creating breakwater at Suvla Bay, September 1915.jpg|thumb|The RAN Bridging Train towing into place a hulk to form a breakwater for the boat dock at West Beach, Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, September 1915.]]
At 5am on 6 August 1915, the Train, embarked upon HMAT A53 Itria, reached its designated anchorage, and the landing was well underway. A party was sent ashore to find the best place to continue the landing, and where to later build the infrastructure to reinforce the Corps. Mid-morning, when Bracegirdle attempted to confer with the IX Corps Chief Engineer, Brigadier-General E.H. Bland {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CB|CMG|RE}}, as ordered, but was unable to be found. This forced the Train to sit idle until late afternoon when they were tasked with putting together a temporary pier at A Landing, which had been left without a party to construct it. It was the second day at Suvla when the Train began to come into its own, constructing two piers and rowing the second into place at A Beach, a trip of approximately {{convert |2|mi}}, for use by the lifeboats evacuating injured soldiers. The Train assembled the 110 metre long structure in 20 minutes&lt;ref name="Official History 394"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=394|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next few days were occupied with constructing further piers as well as landing troops and supplies to assist the landing and shifting their base from their landing point to Kangaroo Beach.

Soon, the Train was put in charge of the landing's water supply, something that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside.&lt;ref name="Official History 394"/&gt; This was just some of the work that saw the Train removed from the [[11th (Northern) Division|11th Division]] and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.

{{quote|The principal duties allotted to the unit by the Royal Navy were as follows: Water supply, care of landing-piers, discharging of stores from store-ships and transports, lighterage of same to the shore, salving of lighters and steamboats wrecked during gales, assisting in salving of T.B.D. ''Louis'', disembarking of troops with their baggage on all beaches, and of munitions and stores. ... &lt;br&gt; The duties allotted to the unit by the [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] the IX Army Corps were briefly as follows : Control and issue of all engineer and trench stores and materials, care and issue of trench bombs and demolition stores (for some weeks after landing, and until proper ordnance dumps were established), erection of high-explosive magazines, dug-outs, cookhouses, and galleys, assembly of hospital huttings, construction of iron frames for front-line wire entanglements; and the manning and control of the steam-tug ''Daphne''.&lt;ref name="Official History 395"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=395|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Lt Commander Bracegirdle|Officer Commanding, RAN Bridging Train}}  Other jobs that fell to the Train to were to act as wireless operators and draughtsmen for the Army Corps and Lt Commander Bracegirdle was the "Beachmaster" of Kangaroo Beach.

[[File:AWM P01326.006 - Turkish shell lands beside a pier, Suvla Bay, October 1915.jpg|thumb|A heavy Turkish shell lands beside a pier constructed by the RAN Bridging Train, Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, October 1915.]]
According to the Train's log, 30 September was a special day. It was the second day in a row that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would make up for the oversight on 1 October, but for the sailors it was a welcome reprieve.&lt;ref name="Official History 395"/&gt; While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where they at least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.

The AIF Official War Correspondent, Charles Bean came to Suvla Bay specifically to report on the Train, where he found that: {{quote|There they are to-day, in charge of the landing of a great part of the stores of a British army. They are quite cut off from their own force; they scarcely come into the category of the Australian Force, and scarcely into that of the British; they are scarcely army and scarcely navy. Who it is that looks after their special interests, and which is the authority that has the power of recognising any good work that they have done, I do not know. If you want to see the work, you have only to go to Kangaroo Beach, Suvla Bay, and look about you. They have made a harbour.&lt;ref name="Makers of Harbour"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10440600 |title=The Makers of a Harbour|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=28 December 1915 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Charles Bean|The Hobart Mercury, December 28, 1915}}

The supplies landed and distributed by the Train were many and varied.

===Evacuation===
{{main|Allied evacuation of Gallipoli}}
In November 1915, the British military hero [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Lord Kitchener]] toured the Dardanelles as part of his review of the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre of operations]]. After two hours at Anzac Cove, he instructed Lt General Birdwood, the Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to begin planning to evacuate the Peninsula. Winter was coming and already too many soldiers were being taken sick and even dying of hypothermia and frostbite, while the Turks had been stubbornly holding their ground. Retreat made sense, aside from just one problem: once the Turks figured out the troops were pulling back, the retreat would very quickly become a bloodbath.

Once the official decision was made by the War Cabinet, preparations were made, carefully disguised to make it seem as though units that could be would be withdrawn to [[Mudros]] safely would be, leaving enough troops to defend the ground taken for the winter, while the bulk of the troops would return in spring for a new offensive. Troops and equipment started slipping away from the front and aboard navy vessels from 8 December 1915.&lt;ref name="evac start"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bean|first=Charles|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume II|page=863|year=1924|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time, the Train's log shows work parties completion construction of roads and buildings on the same day as other parties were disassembling other buildings and stocking supplies for transport, with shifts working around the clock. The sick list came down from 70 men before preparations began to a low of 7 on 12 December. The Chief Engineer of IX Corps, General Bland praised the Train for its work in preparing to depart Suvla, saying that

A fine example of endurance, good organisation, and discipline. Their commanders were indefatigable in anticipating requirements, and assisting whenever and where ever required.

The Train was the last Australian unit to leave the Gallipoli Peninsula, a party of 50 men under Sub-Lieutenant Charles Hicks was left behind to oversee the evacuation of the British forces. They left at 4.30am, on 28 December – eight days after the evacuation of [[Anzac Cove]]. The Train sailed to the Greek isle of [[Mudros]], along with the rest of IX Corps.

==Suez Canal==
{{No. 2 Section, Suez Canal}}

On reaching Mudros, Lt Commander Bracegirdle was hospitalised for Malaria and Jaundice, while command of the Train was returned to the [[11th (Northern) Division|11th Division]]  from IX Corps. The Train was then temporarily transferred, on 26 December 1915, to the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]]. Disciplinary matters, though were handled by [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss]], the Royal Navy officer commanding the [[Moudros|Port of Moudros]]. By 5 February 1916, the transfer to [[I ANZAC Corps]] was official.&lt;ref name="Official History 398"/&gt;

After recuperating at [[Mudros]], the Train set sail under command of Lt. Bond for [[Lake Timsah]] on the [[Suez Canal]] on 17 January, arriving there on the 21st. Here, at Suez Canal No. 2 Section, the Train was responsible for manning and controlling existing bridges, building new bridges, control of tugboats and lighters and the distribution of stores. On 11 February, the Train split into three sections, with Lt. Bond commanding 57 men at a [[Serapeum]] halfway between Lake Tismah and Bitter Lakes, Sub-Lieutenant Charles Hicks with 65 men at the northern approach to Lake Tismah, a place known as Ferry Point. Lt Commander Bracegirdle had joined up with the Train again on 30 January, and was in command at the main camp on Lake Tismah.

Duties at the main camp were light, mainly consisting of experimenting with new iron pontoons, and assisting at the [[Ismaïlia]] Canal Works. The two detachments on the other hand were used to operate the small vessels crossing the Canal at all hours of the day and night, and also forming and breaking the pontoon bridges several times each day.

Come March, the Train was in high demand. Admiral Wemyss, now in command of [[East Indies Station|East Indies &amp; Egyptian Squadron]],&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to use the Train to operate river transports and work as gun crews supporting the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|General Sir Julian Byng]], who had taken command of [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] at Suvla Bay when the elderly [[Frederick Stopford|General Frederick Stopford]] was relieved for incompetence, wanted to bring the Train south to No. 4 Section, Suez Canal, which included all of the Canal south of Small Bitter Lake. Also in March, Lieutenant Bond was transferred to the [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]] detachment in [[Alexandria]], with Lt Clarence Read&lt;ref name="RAN List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Navy List, 1 October 1916|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1916-Supp.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Printer|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking his place as First Lieutenant.

{{No. 4 Section, Suez Canal}}
Byng got his way, and the Train arrived in [[Suez]] on 4 May. No.4 Section was the largest of the Canal's divisions, and the Train's responsibilities increased when they arrived. As well as manning bridges and small vessels, building brides, they were now building wharves and piers, controlling tugboats and all military traffic crossing the Canal and constructing pumping machinery IX Corps knew what the Train was capable of and made sure that they got the most out of the Train they could. On the other hand, though, the weather conditions were harsher than they had been up at No. 2 Section, and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman troops]] were more active in their attempts at sabotage and air raids were common.

The Train's HQ was set up at Kubri West, with a major detachment at Shallufa, and parties also working at Geneffe, Gurka Post, Baluchi Post, [[El Shatt]], the town of [[Suez]], [[Port Tewfik]] and the Canal Quarantine Station, on the [[Gulf of Suez]].&lt;ref name="Official History 400"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=400|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Allied forces were working to push the Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their supplies in, it was decided that a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was no way to get the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new [[wharves]] to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating [[pile driver]]s.

Despite the best efforts of the railway engineers, by the time of the [[Battle of Magdhaba]], the tracks were still {{convert|25|mi}} from the town of El Arish, so the Train was called in to manage the landing of supplies on the beach. Unfortunately, the whole bight was [[naval mine|mined]] and the Royal Navy would be unable to [[Demining|sweep]] it without raising suspicions. The Train's mission was therefore to land on the beach and then construct two piers through the minefield.

Little action was actually seen as the Turks slipped out of El Arish, apparently getting wind of the attack a day before the Train landed. But it was one of the few times that the Train supported other Australian forces in combat, the [[Imperial Camel Corps]] and [[Australian Light Horse]] under General [[Harry Chauvel|Sir Harry Chauvel]] were both involved in the Battle. However, this was the last real action that the Train saw before being disbanded.

==Disbandment==
By the end of 1916, when Lieutenant Cameron was appointed First Lieutenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60470612 |title=Naval Bridging Officer's Return. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=18 July 1917 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; new members who had not served under fire started to complain that they were being used for simple work that could be done by the [[Egyptian Labour Corps|Egyptian labourers]]. Word of this eventually reached the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Defence Department]] who soon wrote to the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Commonwealth Naval Board]], which said that the men of the train "would be unsuitable for use aboard [[Her Majesty's Australian Ship|HMA Ships]]; if no longer required as a Bridging Train, the unit should be disbanded, and its members seither sent as reinforcements to the Australian Engineers or Artillery, or brought back to Australia."&lt;ref name="Official History 610"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra|page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the Defence Department took the matter to the [[War Office]], where [[Archibald Murray|General Archibald Murray]], the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force|General Officer Commanding Egypt]] made his opinion that the Train was engaged in "work of an important military nature" &lt;ref name="Official History 610"/&gt;

Lt Commander Bracegirdle was informed at the start of January 1917 that the Train would be relieved of it duties on the Canal and get back into the War, heading deeper into Palestine. The Train then spent January preparing for their new mission, only to be informed that only part of the unit would be required for the duties in Palestine on 8 February 1917. He was also instructed to find out how his men could be redistributed. 76 indicated they would be willing to transfer to the [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]], 43 to the [[Royal Navy]], while the remainder wished to stay with the Train.

After this, on 18 February, the War Office sent the Defence Department another telegram on the matter, which does not reflect the outcome of Bracegirdle's survey at all: {{quote|Recommend that personnel of Australian Naval Bridging Train be transferred to Australian army, with exception of 4 officers and 80 other ratings who will be retained in unit reorganised in two sections – one consisting of skilled engineers and kindred trades, and one of expert pier-builders and shore-workers. Personnel transferred to Australian army would be posted to whichever arm they are best suited. Anyone not accepting transfer to be discharged and returned to Australia|War Office Telegram|Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|}} Nonetheless, the Australian Government accepted the [[War Office]]'s recommendation. On the same day, Lt Commander Bracegirdle was relieved of command and appointed Officer Commanding Troops aboard the transport [[SS Willochra]], 5 March 1917.

On 20 March, the Train was informed that they were being disbanded and were asked to make a choice as to their next assignment. The results were very clear, the vast majority of members choosing to remain with the Royal Australian Navy.

194 Officers and Ratings embarked on the troopship [[HMAT A45 Bulla]] on 26 May 1917 and arrived at Melbourne on 10 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swinden|first=Greg|title=The Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/royal-australian-naval-bridging-train|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then returned to their State of origin and discharged by 22 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1635148 |title=Disbanded Bridging Train. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=12 July 1917 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bean's Official History states that this came about through a series of miscommunications between the [[War Office]], [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Commonwealth Naval Board]] and the Train itself, and that several months later, in July 1917, it was decided to reform the Train, but its members had dispersed too far to be recalled.

During its existence, the Train had made two amphibious landings ([[Gallipoli]] and [[El Arish]]), and lost 25 sailors killed. Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Mentioned in Despatches]] three times for his command of the Train, while 16 of his men were also Mentioned in Despatches.

'''Sexual repression''' is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing their own [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]], being associated with sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. McClintock, ''Sexual Shame: An Urgent Call to Healing'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, MN. ({{ISBN|0800632389}}) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes sexual repression is subjective and can vary greatly between cultures and moral systems. Many [[Religion and sexuality|religions]]{{which|date=November 2018}} have been accused of fostering sexual repression{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

Some ideologies{{which|date=November 2018}} seek to repress certain forms of sexual expression, such as [[homosexuality]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}, and some cultures{{which|date=November 2018}} even use [[violence|violent practices]] such as [[genital modification and mutilation]], [[honor killings]], or [[stoning]], in an attempt to regulate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]].

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to use the term widely, and argued that it was one of the roots of many problems in [[Western world|Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilf Hey. [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 "Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis and Sexual Repression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033909/http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 |date=2008-05-18 }}, vision.org&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html B.

==Marriage==
{{Further|Child marriage}}
Marriage has been seen as a means of controlling sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1885/&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of marriage, such as [[child marriage]], are often practiced as a means of regulating the sexuality of girls, by ensuring they do not have several partners, thus preserving their [[virginity]] for the future husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090804/http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[BBC World Service]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=Article 16: Right to marriage and family and to equal rights of men and women during and after marriage|publisher=[[BBC World Service]]|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female genital mutilation==
[[File:Fgm_map.gif|200px|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision, "comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa as well as Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen and Indonesia; and more than 125 million girls and women today are estimated to have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM does not have any health benefits, and has serious negative effects on health; including complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM is used as a way of controlling [[female sexuality]]; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

{{quote|FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital [[virginity]] and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist "illicit" sexual acts.}}

FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male circumcision==
{{Main|Circumcision}}
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|300px|Male circumcision [[prevalence]] by country according to a World Health Organization's 2007 review.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male circumcision has been practiced as a surgical means of sexual repression in some cultures, although it may be practiced for various reasons, with the World Health Organization recommending it as a means of reducing [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision is also a religious tradition in Judaism and Islam. According to medieval Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides, the "reason" for male circumcision is "the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late-nineteenth century, circumcision of the penis was prescribed by John Harvey Kellogg as a "cure" for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm#chapi133&lt;/ref&gt; William Acton, a leading authority on sexuality in mid-Victorian Britain, advocated male circumcision in order to prevent "undue excitement of the sexual desires … which it is our object to repress."&lt;ref&gt;Willliam Acton. The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life, Considered in their Physiological, Social, and Moral Relations. Third Edition. London: Churchill, 1862, pp. 5–6. https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cVX7PaDkzGYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A "biocultural analysis" of male circumcision supports the hypothesis "that a practical consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority figures."&lt;ref&gt;Immerman, Ronald S. &amp; Wade C. Mackey (1997) "A biocultural analysis of circumcision." Social Biology 44: 3–4, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having [[sex outside marriage]], becoming the victim of [[rape]], dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN Expert Group Meeting on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices against women:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [honor killings] stem from the deeply-rooted social belief that male family members (in some cases, mothers and other women are involved in planning or carrying out honor crimes) should control the sexuality of or protect the reputation of women in the family, and that they may contain their movements or kill them for blemishing family honor, even when rumors or false gossip are the reason for public suspicion.}}

==Same-sex sexual activity==
{{Further|Sodomy law}}
Various cultures attempt to repress homosexual sexual expression. As of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by prison in 70 countries, and in five other countries and in parts of two others, homosexuality is punishable with the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from criminal prosecution, LGBT individuals may also face social stigmatization and serious violence (see [[violence against LGBT people]]).

==Studies==
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} have hypothesized a relationship between sexual repression and [[rape]]. However, they have been unable to find any support for this hypothesis - whether the tremendous difficulty of measuring sexual repression is to blame, or whether the theory is simply false, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA93 Mary E. Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, ''Confronting rape and sexual assault'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual repression is often viewed as a key issue within [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[feminist views on sexuality]] vary widely.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', neither refutes nor confirms what he calls the "repressive hypothesis." Instead, he says sexuality has become an important topic to understand and manipulate for the purpose of nation building. Through categorization of sexuality, the idea of repression was born. While he agrees sexuality has become much more controlled, he equates it to necessity. Furthermore, it is through [[psychiatric]] and medical discourse on sexuality that it has become repressed.

Foucault argues that religious confession as well as psychiatric procedure codify confession within as a means of extracting [[truth]]. Because the mechanisms of sex were obscure, it was elusive by nature and its mechanisms escaped observation. By integrating it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth century altered the scope of confession. Confession tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide but with what was hidden from himself. It had to be extracted by force, since it involved something that tried to stay hidden. This relationship of truth scientifically validated the view of the confessed which could assimilate, record, and verify this obscure truth.&lt;ref name="Foucault1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The history of sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mbc5eMjLpoC|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-72469-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression in various countries==
{{Incomplete section|date=May 2017}}
Many countries{{which|date=November 2018}} have developed a much more liberal attitude{{cn|date=November 2018}} towards sexuality, but in some{{which|date=November 2018}} it has become less so{{cn|date=November 2018}}:

===China===
Reproduction-based sex was urged by [[Mao Zedong]], but later politicians instituted a [[one-child policy]]. In a country where atheism is popular, the restriction cannot be ascribed to religion but to nationalist motives.&lt;ref name="Body &amp; Society"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Sexual Repression in Maoist China: Ideology, Structure and the Ownership of the Body |journal=[[Body &amp; Society]] |date=September 2005 |last=Yuehong Zhang |first=Everett |volume=11 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/1357034X05056188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2178">'''Smelfungus''' is a name given by [[Laurence Sterne]] to [[Tobias Smollett]] as author of a volume of ''[[Travels through France and Italy]],'' for the snarling abuse he heaps on the institutions and customs of the countries he visited. 

The term "[[wikt:smellfungus|smellfungus]]" (pl. "smellfungi") thereafter passed into broader use to describe a grumbling traveller, and might even be applied to a faultfinder in general.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) pp. 76–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smollett in Europe==
Smollett's 1764 journey to the Continent took place in the wake of a family bereavement, and while he was in poor health—matters which may explain the sharp tone of many of his comments on people, things and places he saw.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 887 and p. 953&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example he described the [[Venus de Medici]] as having "no beauty in the features" and having an attitude which "is awkward and out of character"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;—prompting Sterne's remark that "he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet".&lt;ref&gt;G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revisionists have argued however that the "Smollett" in the ''Travels'' book is a character Smollett intentionally created, rather than him speaking in his own voice as Sterne (facetiously) implies.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlyle's usage==

In the 19th century Smelfungus was adopted by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as a pen-name when he had any seriously severe criticisms to offer on things, particularly those that have gone or are going to the bad. Patrick Proctor Alexander also used the name in his book ''Mill and Carlyle'', which contrasted Carlyle's views with those of [[John Stuart Mill]]. Proctor's ''Occasional Discourse on Sauertieg by Smelfungus'' attacks Carlyle's more brutal ideas.

'''Stem cells'''     are [[cell (biology)|biological cells]] that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into other types of cells and can [[cell division|divide]] to produce more of the same type of stem cells. They are found in [[multicellular organisms]].

In [[mammal]]s, there are two broad types of stem cells: [[embryonic stem cell]]s, which are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and [[adult stem cell]]s, which are found in various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing [[embryo]], stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see [[induced pluripotent stem cells]])—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

There are three known accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:
# [[Bone marrow]], which requires extraction by ''harvesting'', that is, drilling into bone (typically the [[femur]] or [[iliac crest]]).
# Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coughlin RP, Oldweiler A, Mickelson DT, Moorman CT | title = Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Transplant Technique for Degenerative Joint Disease | journal = Arthroscopy Techniques | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e1761-e1766 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29399463 | pmc = 5795060 | doi = 10.1016/j.eats.2017.06.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Blood, which requires extraction through [[apheresis]], wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]]). Stem cells can now be [[Cell culture|artificially grown]] and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] or [[Cellular differentiation#Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiation]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuch BE | title = Stem cells--a clinical update | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 719–21 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16969445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into stem cells grew out of findings by [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A. McCulloch]] and [[James Till|James E. Till]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker AJ, McCULLOCH EA, Till JE | title = Cytological demonstration of the clonal nature of spleen colonies derived from transplanted mouse marrow cells | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | issue = 4866 | pages = 452–4 | date = February 1963 | pmid = 13970094 | doi = 10.1038/197452a0 | bibcode = 1963Natur.197..452B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siminovitch L, Mcculloch EA, Till JE | title = THE DISTRIBUTION OF COLONY-FORMING CELLS AMONG SPLEEN COLONIES | journal = Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–36 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086156 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1030620313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* ''Self-renewal'': the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* ''Potency'': the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms exist to ensure that a stem cell population is maintained:

1. [[Asymmetric cell division|Obligatory asymmetric replication]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.&lt;ref&gt;Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., &amp; Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

===Potency meaning===
{{Main|Cell potency}}
[[Image:Stem cells diagram.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner cell mass (ICM) cells within a blastocyst. These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta. Only cells from an earlier stage of the embryo, known as the [[morula]], are totipotent, able to become all tissues in the body and the extraembryonic placenta.]]

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Deriglasova UF, Kulagina NN, Panasuk AF, Rudakowa SF, Luriá EA, Ruadkow IA | title = Precursors for fibroblasts in different populations of hematopoietic cells as detected by the in vitro colony assay method | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–92 | year = 1974 | pmid = 4455512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Stem Cell Therapy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976001611602093|journal=Apollo Medicine|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=271–276|doi=10.1016/S0976-0016(11)60209-3|issn=0976-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

[[Embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) are the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] of a [[blastocyst]], an early-stage [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM | title = Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5391 | pages = 1145–7 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9804556 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145 | bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[embryo]]s reach the [[blastocyst]] stage 4–5 days post [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ESCs are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]].

During embryonic development these inner cell mass cells continuously divide and become more specialized.  For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as '[[neurectoderm]]', which will become the future [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore| name-list-format = vanc  |title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in development, [[neurulation]] causes the neurectoderm to form the [[neural tube]].  At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes [[encephalization]] to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain.  At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a [[neural stem cell]].  These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics.  The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called [[neurogenesis]].  One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the [[radial glial cell]], so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some [[glial]] characteristics, most notably the expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology | journal = Nature Reviews.

Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ([[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s), and thus their potency is restricted.&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"/&gt;

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass.  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to [[GSK3B]] and the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying QL, Wray J, Nichols J, Batlle-Morera L, Doble B, Woodgett J, Cohen P, Smith A | title = The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7194 | pages = 519–23 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18497825 | pmc = 5328678 | doi = 10.1038/nature06968 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..519Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic [[fibroblasts]] and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).&lt;ref&gt;

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try and catch complications of diseases, or to study cells reactions to potentially new drugs.  The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells.  [[Roman Catholic]] teaching forbids the use of embryonic stem cells in experimentation; accordingly, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper "[[Osservatore Romano]]" called amniotic stem cells "the future of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_newspaper_calls_new_stem_cell_source_future_of_medicine/ |title=Vatican newspaper calls new stem cell source 'future of medicine' :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2010-02-03 |access-date=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induced pluripotent==
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three [[germ layers]]. As such, they are deemed [[cell potency|multipotent]].

However, [[reprogramming]] allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein [[transcription factors]], pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making human embryonic stem cells|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10170972|date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16466265|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=Skin Cells Can Become Embryonic Stem Cells|author1=Brand, Madeleine |author2=Palca, Joe |author3=Cohen, Alex |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec07/stemcells_11-20.html|title=Breakthrough Set to Radically Change Stem Cell Debate|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by [[Shinya Yamanaka]] and his colleagues at [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref name = "overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimbrel EA, Lanza R | title = Pluripotent stem cells: the last 10 years | journal = Regenerative Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 831–847 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27908220 | doi = 10.2217/rme-2016-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the transcription factors [[Oct-4|Oct3/4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[Klf4]] to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "og Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.&lt;ref name= "2007 Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18035408 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junying Yu]], [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], and their colleagues at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human [[foreskin]].&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wisconsin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu J, Vodyanik MA, Smuga-Otto K, Antosiewicz-Bourget J, Frane JL, Tian S, Nie J, Jonsdottir GA, Ruotti V, Stewart R, Slukvin II, Thomson JA | title = Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1917–20 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18029452 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151526 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1917Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were able to replicate [[Yamanaka]]'s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as [[pluripotency]] and differentiation potential, the expression of [[pluripotency]] genes, [[epigenetic]] patterns, [[embryoid body]] and [[teratoma]] formation, and viable [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]] formation,&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more "closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; There are thus questions about the "completeness" of [[reprogramming]] and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing [[adult cell]]s to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;"His inspiration comes from the research by Prof [[Shinya Yamanaka]] at [[Kyoto University]], which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement."{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning|author=Highfield, Roger |date=2007-11-16|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are [[pluripotent]]. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if [[reprogramming]] to pluripotency was "complete").&lt;ref name = "overview" /&gt; Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="R&amp;D"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinton DA, Daley GQ | title = The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7381 | pages = 295–305 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258608 | pmc = 3652331 | doi = 10.1038/nature10761 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..295R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703175036/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre6604si-us-stemcells-frozen/ Frozen blood a source of stem cells, study finds]. newsdaily.com (2010-07-01)&lt;/ref&gt; Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.&lt;ref name= "R&amp;D" /&gt; Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckmann J, Scheitza S, Wernet P, Fischer JC, Giebel B | title = Asymmetric cell division within the human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment: identification of asymmetrically segregating proteins | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 5494–501 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17332245 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;

==Treatments==
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition.  [[Bone marrow transplant]] is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013  [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site. Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010.  Cited August 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Master |first=Zubin |last2=McLeod |first2=Marcus |last3=Mendez |first3=Ivar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007 |title=Benefits, Risks and Ethical Considerations in Translation of Stem Cell Research to Clinical Applications in Parkinson's Disease |jstor=27719821 |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, with the ability of scientists to isolate and culture [[embryonic stem cells]], and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] and techniques to create [[induced pluripotent stem cells]], controversy has crept in, both related to [[abortion debate|abortion politics]] and to [[human cloning]].

'''Sustainable architecture''' is [[architecture]] that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Architecture and Simulation Modelling", Dublin Institute of Technology, [http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html#_Toc397853444] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035740/http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html |date=2013-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of sustainability, or [[ecological design]], is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Doerr Architecture, Definition of Sustainability and the Impacts of Buildings [http://www.doerr.org/services/sustainability.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy use==
{{Main|Low-energy house|Zero-energy building}}
[[File:K2 apartments windsor.jpg|thumb|K2 sustainable apartments in [[Windsor, Victoria]], Australia by DesignInc (2006) features [[passive solar building design|passive solar design]], recycled and sustainable materials, [[photovoltaic cells]], [[wastewater]] treatment, [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater collection]] and [[solar hot water]].]]
[[File:Passivhaus section en.jpg|thumb|The [[passivhaus]] standard combines a variety of techniques and technologies to achieve ultra-low energy use.]]
[[File:Arts Center Greensburg, Kansas, Photo by Eric Ascalon.jpg|thumb|Following its destruction by a tornado in 2007, the town of [[Greensburg, Kansas]] (United States) elected to rebuild to highly stringent LEED Platinum environmental standards.  Shown is the town's new art center, which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency.]]

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture. [[Architect]]s use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of [[site analysis]].

===Heating, ventilation and cooling system efficiency===
Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.&lt;ref name ="Montavon"&gt;M. Montavon, Optimization of Urban Form by the Evaluation of the Solar Potential, ''EPFL'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] element of an efficient [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)]] system is a [[Building insulation|well-insulated building]]. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel [[indoor air quality|polluted indoor air]].

Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and [[compost]] streams. [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off the shelf]], on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture [[Waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]].

HVAC systems are powered by motors. [[Copper]], versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. 

Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.

[[Passive solar building design]] allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any [[active solar]] mechanisms such as [[photovoltaic cell]]s or [[solar hot water|solar hot water panels]]. Typically [[passive solar]] building designs incorporate materials with high [[thermal mass]] that retain heat effectively and strong [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition, [[low energy building]]s typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more "organic") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as [[United States|American]] [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] [[saltbox]] designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.

Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed [[insulated glazing|insulated windows]] with gas filled spaces and [[Low-emissivity|low emissivity (low-E)]] coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.  [[Deciduous trees]] are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).  [[Coniferous]] or [[Evergreen|evergreen plants]] are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.

In colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.

In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry [[building material]]s with [[high thermal mass]] are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.

In climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on [[fossil fuel]]s or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when [[renewable energy]] is used.

===Renewable energy generation===

====Solar panels====
{{Main|Solar PV}}
[[Active solar]] devices such as [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=shamilton |url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm |title=Module Pricing |publisher=Solarbuzz |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.

Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.

To maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15°. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15°. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.&lt;ref&gt;G.Z. Brown, Mark DeKay. Sun, Wind &amp; Light. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind turbines====
{{Main|Wind power}}
The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brower, Michael; ''Cool Energy, The Renewable Solution to Global Warming''; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8&amp;nbsp;mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37&amp;nbsp;mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, Paul; ''Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Farm and Business''; Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece The Sunday Times, "Home wind turbines dealt killer blow"], April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com "Wind turbine, a powerful investment", Rapid City Journal], February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Factors enhancing aerofoil wings for wind energy harnessing in buildings,7 November 2013 http://bse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0143624413509097.abstract?papetoc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar water heating====
{{Main|Solar thermal power}}
[[Solar water heater]]s, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Water Heaters, March 24, 2009 [http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |title=Solar Water Heaters |publisher=Toolbase.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415230351/http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.

The two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"&gt;John Randolph and Gilbert M. Masters, 2008. "Energy for Sustainability: Technology, Planning, Policy," Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500&amp;nbsp;kW·h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

====Heat pumps====
Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70&amp;nbsp;°F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85&amp;nbsp;°F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.

Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

For areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.

Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

In terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.

==Sustainable building materials==
{{See also|Green building}}
Some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled [[denim]] or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, [[Trass]], [[Linoleum]],&lt;ref&gt;Duurzaam en Gezond Bouwen en Wonen by Hugo Vanderstadt,&lt;/ref&gt; sheep wool, [[concrete]] (high and ultra high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1864315,00.html|title=Building Materials: Cementing the Future|first=PETER|last=GUMBEL|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; roman self-healing concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6250-6_9|title=Self Healing Materials|first=Henk M.|last=Jonkers|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=195–204|via=link.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seegrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sand stone, locally obtained stone and rock, and [[bamboo]], which is one of the strongest and fastest growing [[woody plant]]s, and non-toxic low-[[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.

===Recycled materials===

[[File:Discarded dreams 2 of 3.jpg|thumb|Recycling items for building]]
Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as [[reclaimed lumber]] and [[Copper in architecture|recycled copper]]. The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in [[embodied energy]] (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good [[dimension stone]] is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as [[bamboo]], which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth, [[sorghum]] or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or [[cork oak]], in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.

===Lower volatile organic compounds===

Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ([[volatile organic compound]])-emitting materials such as [[Building insulation materials#Cotton batts (Blue Jean)|recycled denim]] or [[cellulose insulation]], rather than the [[building insulation materials]] that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with [[boric acid]]. Organic or milk-based paints may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Information on low-emitting materials may be found at www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php [http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php IAQ links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611163251/http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a common fallacy is that "green" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more "traditional" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Building Emissions Study accessed at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm California Integrated Waste Management web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing [[sick building syndrome]] type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.

Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.&lt;ref&gt;James, J.P., Yang, X. Indoor and Built Environment, Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from Several Green and Non-Green Building Materials: A Comparison, January 2004.[http://ibe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/14/1/69] Retrieved: 2008-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials sustainability standards===
Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels, [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[certifications]].  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1944523|title=Toward a Rational Framework for Sustainable Building Materials Standards|first1=Jorge L.|last1=Contreras|first2=Hannah|last2=Roth|first3=Meghan|last3=Lewis|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.&lt;ref&gt;John Ringel., University of Michigan, Sustainable Architecture, Waste Prevention [http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/ARCHpdfs/ARCHr&amp;rA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of [[waste management]], incorporating things such as [[grey water]] systems for use on garden beds, and [[composting toilet]]s to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of packaging waste. 

==Building placement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Second, they usually increase the [[energy consumption]] required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light [[Urban planning|urban development]] articulated by the [[New Urbanist]] movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]. The study of [[Permaculture]], in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.

==Sustainable building consulting==
A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of [[building materials]], orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.

Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/?CategoryID=19|title=U.S. Green Building Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/|title=ENERGY STAR - The Simple Choice for Energy Efficiency|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] to be met and provide [[Performance metric|metrics]] and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.

==Changing pedagogues==

Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], “The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,” ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “sustainability” in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of “green” design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|human interrelationship with nature]]. Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Brian|title=Urban Design Ecologies: AD Reader|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-97405-6|pages=220–237|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470974052.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable urbanism and architecture==
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|first=|last=taotiadmin|date=20 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Sustainability - Architecture: between Fuzzy Systems and Wicked Problems |author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Blueprints  | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/blueprints21_1.pdf | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. "LEED" (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the "sustainable" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness. 

Ethics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community. With every revolutionary technology or innovation there comes criticisms of legitimacy and effectiveness when and how it is being utilized. Many of the criticisms of sustainable architecture do not reflect every aspect of it but rather a broader spectrum across the international community.

'''''The Naked Scientists''''' is a one-hour audience-interactive [[science]] radio talk show broadcast live by the [[BBC]] in the [[East of England]], nationally by BBC Radio 5 Live and internationally on [[Radio National|ABC Radio National, Australia]]; it is also distributed globally as a [[podcast]].

The programme was created and is edited by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] consultant virologist [[Chris Smith (doctor)|Dr Chris Smith]]. The present ''Naked Scientists'' line up also includes science broadcaster and harpist Kat Arney and producers Georgia Mills, Adam Murphy, Katie Haylor and Izzie Clarke, with [[Peter Cowley]] adding a technology perspective

In 2009 the group appointed the first official ''Naked Scientists'' PhD student, Diana O'Carroll, to examine the educational impacts of science broadcasting and new media. O'Carroll also set up a 
''Naked Scientists'' spin-off podcast, ''Naked Archaeology'', which launched in 2008. A second spin-off, ''Naked Astronomy'', featuring Cambridge University-based space scientists and astronomers, has been podcast since December 2009. Naked Astronomy also hosts the Space Boffins podcast, produced by journalists Richard Hollingham and Sue Nelson. A combined video and audio programme, ''Naked Engineering'', produced by Dave Ansell and Meera Senthilingam and supported by the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], launched in September 2010. For Christmas 2010 the group also showcased a new video podcast strand, the ''Naked Science Scrapbook''. In 2012, a Naked Neuroscience strand was unveiled, and in 2013 the Material Chef video series, showcasing materials science, was launched.

==''Naked Scientists'' show content==
Each episode of the main ''Naked Scientists'' programme is one hour long and includes a digest of topical science news stories, audience questions answered live on the air and interviews with guest scientists. These individuals join the hosts in the studio to talk about their work and to take questions live from listeners. Previous featured guests include the discoverer of the DNA fingerprint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/html/shows/2005.12.04.htm |title=Forensics, DNA Fingerprinting and Human Origins |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2005-12-04 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alec Jeffreys]], the  [[Astronomer Royal]]  Sir [[Martin Rees]], and the co-discoverer of [[DNA]] structure, [[James D. Watson]].

The show also features on-location reports and interviews, and an ad-hoc interactive segment called ''Kitchen Science'' where listeners are encouraged to attempt a science experiment at home during the show. Kitchen Science experiments have included building a desktop [[trebuchet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/the-trebuchet/ |title=The Trebuchet |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[chocolate]] [[teapot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-useless-is-a-chocolate-teapot/ |title=How useless is a Chocolate Teapot? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Liver]] powered [[Bottle Rocket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/fizzes-from-peroxide/ |title=Fizzes from peroxide |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kitchen Science segment also hosts experiments that listeners may not be able to do at home, such as generating [[X-rays]] from Sticky Tape &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/glowing-tape/ |title=Glowing tape |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Dr Carlos Camara of [[UCLA]] and testing how much fat would stop a bullet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-fat-would-you-have-to-be-to-stop-a-bullet/ |title=How fat would you have to be to stop a bullet? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with researchers at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]].

==Awards and prizes==
''The Naked Scientists'' have won eight national and international awards for science communication since 2006. The show won the [[Biosciences Federation]] Prize for Science Communication, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm Biosciences Federation Science Communication Award 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113175023/http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Joshua Phillips Award for Innovation in Science Engagement in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |title=And the winner is... |publisher=[[Manchester Science Festival]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218231113/http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |archivedate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Society for General Microbiology]]'s Peter Wildy Prize 2008, the [[Royal Society]] [[Kohn Award]] for 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/awards/kohn-award/ |title=Royal Society Kohn Award |publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Best Radio Show Award at the Population Institute's 29th Global Media Awards, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |title=29th Annual Global Media Award Winners Announced |publisher=The Population Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224102213/http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |archivedate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Podcast Award]] for UK Non-Profit podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.european-podcast-award.eu/european-podcast-award-0809-winners-announced-44 |title=European Podcast Award 08/09 Winners announced |date=2009-04-01 |publisher=European Podcast Award |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural Royal College of Pathologists Furness Prize for science communication 2010 and the Society of Biology Science Communication Prize 2012.

''The Naked Scientists'' was also in the five finalists in the 2006 World Podcast Awards and received two nominations, for "best produced" and "best science and technology podcast" in the 2007 awards. It was also a top five finalist in the 2008 and 2009 awards.

Bandwidth consumed by the programme's podcast exceeds 28TB (terabytes) of downloads per month and more than 40 million copies have been downloaded since 2007.

==Other media==
The Naked Scientists appeared on [[Five (TV channel)|TV Channel Five's]] [[panel game]] ''[[The What in the World? Quiz]]'' and have contributed to the 2007 [[Channel 4]] programme "The Farm Revealed". In September 2008, with the [[Open University]], the Naked Scientists launched a new UK national radio edition of their programme, ''The Naked Scientists - Up All Night'' (subsequently renamed "Breaking Science") which was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] for 12 months before finishing in 2009.

In November 2008, with the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], a series entitled ''The Naked Scientists In Africa'' began on [[Channel Africa]], the [[international broadcasting]] service of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].   ''The Naked Scientists in Africa'' was produced by Naked Scientist team-member Meera Senthilingam, incorporating international science news and a focus on science stories originating in, or pertinent to, African countries. This project ran until 2010.

==Scheduling changes==
In August 2012, BBC East announced an impending change to the Sunday schedule, which would see the show discontinued. In response to public reaction, the head of BBC East, Mick Rawsthorne, was interviewed on national radio about the decision to end the programme. Rawsthorne explained that the ''Naked Scientists'' did not fit the station's core purpose of providing "local radio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2012/nov/20/1 |title=Radio Ga Ga: BBC axes popular science radio show|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nq3lx |title=BBC Radio 4 - Feedback, 09/11/2012 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=2012-11-11 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rawsthorne did acknowledge the quality of the ''Naked Scientists'' programming and recognised that, with Cambridge University at the heart of Cambridgeshire, special consideration should be made for science in Cambridgeshire. Consequently, the BBC reconsidered their decision to terminate the programme and developed a proposal for it to continue as well as a way for enhanced scientific coverage and content to be integrated within the other mainstream mid-week outputs of [[BBC Cambridgeshire]], significantly increasing the reach of the programme and the representation of science within the outputs of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.

From January 2013, a new initiative involving the Naked Scientists began on BBC Radio Norfolk. A dedicated hour of science Q and A was included within the station's Tea Time output (hosted by Matthew Gudgin) on alternate Wednesday evenings from 1800-1900. Listeners call, text, tweet or email with questions on any scientific subject and the team answer them.

==ABC Radio National, Australia==
From January 2013, the ''Naked Scientists'' programme also began to air across Australia on [[ABC Radio National]], initially on a Sunday morning. From January 2014 the first airing of the programme was moved to a Friday evening 10pm slot, repeated on Sundays at 1500. This show is also released as the Naked Scientists Podcast.

==BBC Radio 5 live Science==
Launched in May 2014, ''5 live Science'' is a new weekly one-hour programme from the Naked Scientists aired by [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC 5 live]]. Under the banner ''5 live Science'' it's a newly formatted version of the show produced by the Naked Scientists team and fronted by [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Dr Chris Smith]]; it airs nationally every Sunday morning. The programme is also released as a podcast under the same name. 

==Internship Programme==
The Naked Scientists regularly host paid internships including positions supported in the past by Cambridge University, the Royal Academy of Engineering, MRC (Medical Research Council), STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council), the UK's Genetics Society and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The present programme targets science PhD students. Applicants are "bought out" from their research projects for two months to join the Naked Scientists team where they learn to participate in the programme-making process, including presenting, writing and publishing skills. In 2017 the Naked Scientists hosted their first international trainee when University of Western Australia PhD student Michael Wheeler joined the team, and in 2018 Virginia Tech students Marika Ottman and Vy Nguyen received support from Rolls-Royce to pursue a placement with the Naked Scientists.

==Funders and supporters==
The Naked Scientists have received funding and awards from the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), Cambridge University including the Isaac Newton Trust, the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

'''''The Simple Art of Murder''''' is [[hard-boiled]] [[detective fiction]] author [[Raymond Chandler]]'s critical [[essay]], a magazine article, and his collection of [[short story|short stories]]. The essay was first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in December 1944. The magazine article appeared in the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'', April 15, 1950. The article, somewhat rewritten, served to introduce the collection ''The Simple Art of Murder'', 1950  ([[Houghton Mifflin]] Co.), which contained eight of Chandler's early stories pre-dating his first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]''.

The essay is considered a seminal piece of [[literary criticism]].  Although Chandler's primary topic is the art (and failings) of detective fiction, he touches on general [[literature]] and [[modernity |modern society]] as well.

The opening statement &amp;ndash; "Fiction in any form has always intended to be realistic" &amp;ndash; places Chandler in a lineage with earlier American [[realism (arts) | Realists]], in particular [[Mark Twain]] and his critique of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], "[[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses]]".  Chandler dissects [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' much as Twain tears apart Cooper's ''[[Leatherstocking Tales |The Deerslayer]]'', namely by revealing what is ignored, brushed over, and unrealistic.  "If the situation is false," Chandler writes, "you cannot even accept it as a light novel, for there is no story for the light novel to be about."  He expands his criticism to the bulk of detective fiction, especially of the English variety which he complains is preoccupied with "hand-wrought [[duelling pistol |dueling pistol]]s, [[curare]] and [[tropical fish]]."  In addition to Milne, Chandler confronts [[Agatha Christie |Dame Agatha Christie]], [[Dorothy Sayers]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[E. C. Bentley]], and [[Freeman Wills Crofts]].  "The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers."  Chandler's critique of the "classic" [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction |Golden Age]] detective story goes beyond a lack of realistic characters and plot; Chandler complains about contrivances and formulas and an inability to move beyond them.  The classic detective story "has learned nothing and forgotten nothing."

Chandler reserves his praise for [[Dashiell Hammett]]. Although Chandler and Hammett were contemporaries and grouped as the founders of the hard-boiled school, Chandler speaks of Hammett as the "one individual... picked out to represent the whole movement," noting Hammett's mastery of the "[[American English|American language]]", his adherence to reality, and that he "gave [[murder]] back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse."

Chandler concludes his essay by moving from reality in literature to reality itself, "a world in which gangsters can rule nations and almost rule cities... it is not a fragrant world, but it is the world you live in."  He states that this world requires the hero of Hammett's (and his own) fiction, a man who walks the "mean streets" with a sense of honor and a notion of justice, who neither wears them on his sleeve nor allows them to be corrupted.

==References in other work==

The [[Geraldine McEwan]] [[telemovie]] based on Agatha Christie's novel ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' shows [[Miss Marple]] reading Chandler's book. Early in the telemovie Miss Marple says, "There is never anything simple about murder."
