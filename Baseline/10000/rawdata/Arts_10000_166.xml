      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">"'''And death shall have no dominion'''" is a poem written by Welsh poet [[Dylan Thomas]] (1914–1953). The title comes from [[St. Paul]]'s [[epistle to the Romans]] (6:9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lit.genius.com/Dylan-thomas-and-death-shall-have-no-dominion-annotated Online copy of the poem]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
In early 1933 Thomas befriended Bert Trick, a grocer who worked in the Uplands area of [[Swansea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferris (1989), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Trick was an amateur poet who had several poems published in local papers. In spring 1933 Trick suggested the two men both write a poem on the subject of 'immortality'. Trick's poem, which was published in a newspaper the following year, contained the refrain "For death is not the end."&lt;ref name="Ferris183"&gt;Ferris (1989) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, in a notebook marked 'April', Thomas wrote the poem "And death shall have no dominion". Trick persuaded him to seek a publisher and in May of that year it was printed in ''[[New English Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferris183"/&gt;

On 10 September 1936, two years after the release of his first volume of poetry (''[[18 Poems]]''), ''Twenty-five Poems'' was published. It revealed Thomas' personal beliefs pertaining to religion and the forces of nature, and included "And death shall have no dominion".

==In popular culture==
* The Year One ''[[Space: 1999]]'' episode "[[Death's Other Dominion]]" is titled after the poem.
* The poem is featured significantly in the television series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.
* It was used at the start and ending of the movie ''[[Omega Doom]]''.
* The titles of the novels ''They Shall Have Stars'' by [[James Blish]] and ''No Dominion'' by [[Charlie Huston]] are taken from the poem.
* In [[Brave Saint Saturn]]'s album ''[[Anti-Meridian (album)|Anti-Meridian]]'' the final five lines of the first verse open the CD, accompanied by music.
* In the film ''[[Truly, Madly, Deeply]]'' the title is quoted in a conversation about death.
* In the film ''[[The Weight of Water (film)|The Weight of Water]]'' from the [[The Weight of Water|book of the same title]] written by [[Anita Shreve]], Sean Penn in the role of melancholy poet Thomas Janes recites the last four lines of the first stanza. At the end of the film after Janes drowns, the film reprises his recitation of the second and third lines of this section, but this time the film leaves the last line poignantly unspoken.
* In the second and final part of the 2011 BBC TV miniseries ''[[The Field of Blood (TV series)|The Field of Blood]]'' the poem's second through ninth lines are recited from memory by character Dr. Pete, played by [[Peter Capaldi]], in a pub as he drunkenly faces his imminent death of cancer, seated alone.
* [[George Clooney]] recites part of the poem in the 2002 movie ''[[Solaris (2002 film)|Solaris]]''.
* In the 2003 film ''Rosenstrasse'' this poem is quoted as two Jewish women await deportation to Auschwitz.
* In the Season 6 soundtrack of ''Lost'' the piece which shares its name with the poem is played while detailing Richard Alpert's life.
* Paul Kelly performs the poem as a song on his 2018 album ''[[Nature (Paul Kelly album)|Nature]]''.

''''' Annunciation of Fano''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1488-1490, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy.

The work was successful, and a few years later he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the same church, the [[Fano Altarpiece]].

==Description==
The painting is set within a four bay portico, a common element in Perugino's paintings from the 1480s (as, for example, in the [[Albani-Torlonia Polyptych]] and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''). Behind it, is a background with hills featuring light trees.

In the foreground is the [[Annunciation]], lit from the left. The angel, holding a white lily (symbol of purity), announces that she will bear Jesus; Mary, who was previously reading a book on a classical altar in front of her, has a surprised face. Behind them, in the upper center, is God in an oval with cherubim and seraphim, sending the Holy Spirit (portrayed as a dove) to her.

An '''arcosolium''', plural '''arcosolia''', is an arched recess used as a place of entombment. The word is from Latin ''arcus'', "arch", and ''solium'', "throne" (literally: "place of state") or post-classical "[[sarcophagus]]".{{dubious|What is it supposed to mean, "place of state"? And what is the connection to "sarcophagus? Mess...|date=August 2018}}

Early arcosolia were [[cut from the living rock|carved out of the living rock]] in [[catacomb]]s. In the very earliest of these, the arched recess was cut to ground level. Then a low wall would be built in the front, leaving a trough (the ''cubiculum'', "chamber") in which to place the body. A flat stone slab would then cover the chamber containing the body, thus sealing it. The stone slab occasionally also served as an altar, especially for Christians, who celebrated Mass on them. In the later arcosolia, the arched recess was carved out to about waist height. Then the masons cut downwards to make the chamber into which the corpse would be placed. In effect, the trough was then a sarcophagus with living rock on five of its six faces. As before, a flat stone slab would then seal the ''cubiculum''. 

From the 13th century onwards, and continuing into the [[Renaissance]], arcosolia were built above ground, particularly in the walls of churches. In these post-Roman era recesses, which were built of brick and marble, the sarcophagi are usually separate from the arch. These tombs are highly ornamented in the styles of those periods;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L. (ed.) (1957) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Oxford U. P.; p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Flamboyant|Flamboyant Gothic]], [[Plateresque]], and [[High Renaissance]] styles are all represented.

'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1932 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[United States]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

'''The Bedia Chalice ''' is a piece of the medieval Georgian goldsmithery, a liturgical vessel made of ducat gold and richly decorated. Dated to {{circa|999}}, the chalice was commissioned by King [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] for the [[Bedia Monastery]] in [[Abkhazia]]. Only the bowl of the vessel is preserved and currently kept at the [[Georgian National Museum]] in [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wixom|first1=William D.|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Helen C.|editor2-last=Wixom|editor2-first=William D.|title=The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era, A.D. 843–1261|date=1997|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870997777|pages=342-344|url=https://books.google.ge/books?id=Caqa12aj55wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Liturgical vessel from Bedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Ages Embossing Arts: Bedia Chalice|url=http://museum.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=216&amp;info_id=12438|publisher=Georgian National Museum|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The chalice was a donation by King Bagrat III and his mother, [[Gurandukht of Abkhazia|Queen Gurandukht]], to the new church at Bedia, which was completed in 999.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt; The base of the vessel was subsequently lost and restored in the 16th century at the behest of Germane Chkhetidze, Metropolitan Bishop of Bedia, as mentioned in a Georgian inscription. The item was preserved in the [[sacristy]] of the [[Ilori Church]], when the historian [[Dimitri Bakradze]] visited it in 1865 and reported the danger of its being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakradze|first1=Dimitri Z.|authorlink1=Dimitri Bakradze|editor1-last=Berge|editor1-first=Adolf|editor1-link=Adolf Berge|script-title=ru:Акты, собранные Кавказской археографической комиссией.

== Description ==
The bowl of the Bedia vessel is 14 cm high and 14 cm in diameter; it weighs 752 g. The piece is made of one sheet of gold, with all figures and details worked in [[repoussé]]. The entire outer surface is framed and divided into 12 segments by a continuous arcade. The figures depicted are the enthroned [[Christ Pantokrator]] and the [[Virgin Hodegetria]] on the opposite side. Between them are standing figures of ten [[apostles]], five on each side, holding [[rotulus|rotuli]] in their hands. Christ is identified by a Greek inscription and all apostles by the Georgian texts; there is no inscription associated with the Virgin. The Georgian-language inscription{{refn|name=a|group=n|The inscription reads in ''asomtavruli'': ႼႫႨႣႠႭ ႶႫႰႧႨႱႫႸႭႡႤႪႭ ႫႤႭႾ ႤႷႠႥ ႼႨႬႠႸႤ ႻႨႱႠ ႸႤႬႨႱႠ ႡႠႢႰႠႲ ႠႴႾႠႦႧႠ ႫႤႴႤႱႠ ႣႠ ႣႤႣႠႱႠ ႫႠႧႱႠ ႢႳႰႠႬႣႳႾႲ ႣႤႣႭႴႠႪႱႠ ႠႫႨႱ ႡႠႰႻႨႫႨႱႠ ႸႤႫႼႨႰႥႤႪႧႠ ႠႫႨႬ; in ''[[mkhedruli]]'' transcription: {{lang-ka|„წმიდაო ღმრთისმშობელო, მეოხ ეყავ წინაშე ძისა შენისა ბაგრატ აფხაზთა მეფესა და დედასა მათსა გურანდუხტ დედოფალსა, ამის ბარძიმისა შემწირველთა, ამის საკურთხევლისა შემამკობელთა და ამის წმიდისა საყდრისა აღმშენებელთა. ამინ“|tr}},&lt;ref name="top"/&gt; translated as: "Holy Mother of God, intercede before your son for Bagrat, king of the Abkhazians, and his mother, the queen Gurandukht, the commissioners of this vessel, the decorators of this altar, and the builders of this holy church.

The Bedia chalice is notable for the orderly and rhythmic composition and decorative details which are endogenously Georgian, but exhibit some stylistic affinities with the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine ivory icons]] and enameled chalices in the [[St Mark's Basilica#The treasury|Treasury of San Marco]], Venice. Yet, robust monumental effect of the artwork of the Bedia chalice is unparalleled.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

'''Bobby Baker''' (born 1950, Kent) is a multi-disciplinary [[artist]] and [[activist]] working across performance, drawing and [[Multi-media artist|multi-media]]. Baker is the artistic director of the arts organisation Daily Life Ltd.

==Information==
Baker lives in [[London]], England. She studied [[Painting|painting]] at [[St. Martins School of Art]] (now Central Saint Martins) between 1968 and 1972. She was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] by [[Queen Mary University]] London in 2011. In a career spanning over four decades she has, among other things, danced with [[meringue]] ladies; made a life-sized edible version of her family; and driven around the streets of [[Haarlem]], Holland strapped to the back of a truck yelling at passers by through a [[megaphone]] to ''Pull Yourselves Together''.

Daily Life Ltd is an arts organisation that produces the work of Baker and others. Together they create powerful art that investigates and questions the way people think about [[feminism]], [[daily life]] and [[mental health]]. These artworks cross many disciplines and provide unique, high quality artistic experiences for a wide range of audiences both nationally and internationally. They seek to challenge the [[stigmatisation]] and discrimination of people with experience of [[mental distress]] and raise public awareness of this vital sector. In March 2011 Daily Life Ltd became part of [[Arts Council England]]’s National Portfolio.

==Activism==
Baker's 2009 [[Wellcome Trust]] Diary Drawing [https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/bobby-bakers-diary-drawings] exhibition about her experience of mental illness and recovery launched her onto a worldwide platform of mental health and arts campaigners, connecting her with a growing network of organisations and practitioners. Since then, she has aimed to use her position to help promote and foster opportunities for diverse marginalised artists. Her work focuses on undervalued and stigmatised aspects of everyday life and human behaviour, expressly undertaking to foreground the lives of women in the mainstream and bring status to so-called ‘humble’ daily activity.

As an internationally acclaimed female artist with personal experience of mental illness and physical disability, Baker offers an authentic figure of recovery and leadership through creativity. She is uniquely positioned with the experience, insight, talent and extensive cross-disciplinary network to investigate and celebrate creative ways people manage difficulties and disenfranchisement.

The '''Chest of Saint Simeon''' or '''Saint Simeon's Casket''' ({{lang-hr|Škrinja sv. Šimuna}}) is a rectangular [[cedar wood|cedarwood]] [[sarcophagus]] in the shape of a ''[[Chasse (casket)|chasse]]'', overlaid with silver and silver-gilt plaques, said to hold the relics of [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|St Simon the God-receiver]]; it is located over the main altar in the Church of Saint Simeon in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. The chest, considered a masterpiece of medieval art and also a unique monument of the goldsmith's craft of the age, is one of the most interesting works in gold in Europe now under the protection of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="Marijan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wingfield"/&gt; It was made by local goldsmiths to an Italian design between 1377 and 1380.

The cult of St. Simeon, the story of how the queen stole the finger of Zadar's patron saint, or ''[[gonfaloniere|gonfaloniero]]'' as the locals call it,&lt;ref name="Wingfield"&gt;Wingfield, William Frederic (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BynE50-eeVAC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gonfaloniero&amp;f=false ''A Tour in Dalmatia, Albania, and Montenegro with an Historical Sketch of the Republic of Ragusa, from the earliest times down to its final fall'', p. 56.] Cosimo classics travel &amp; exploration, New York. 2007 reprint of book about 1853 tour. {{ISBN|1-60206-288-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the donation of a magnificent shrine to atone for the stealing of the saint's finger illustrate not only the political aspect orchestrated by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] amid the people's belief in the authenticity of Zadar's body over the one kept in [[Venice]], but also the high level of development and quality in [[goldsmithing]] during the second half of the fourteenth century.

The top of the chest containing the [[mummy|mummified]] body of the silver-crowned bearded saint enclosed behind a sheet of transparent glass is elevated above the main altar and displayed to the public, as well as its interior full of precious gifts given by [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], every year on 8 October, at 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Arambašić"&gt;Višnja Arambašić, Nataly Anderson, Frank Jelinčić, Tocher Mitchell (2007).

==History==

===The legend of the chest===
Eastern Roman emperors who were seated in Constantinople in the sixth century were not only expanding their collection of valuable works of art, but also relics of saints in order to be able to stand side by side with Rome's. So, between 565 and 568 AD the sarcophagus where the remains of St. Simeon were being kept was moved from [[Syria]] to [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27414/Anthony-Of-Novgorod|title=Anthony Of Novgorod|author=Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According to some historians, the saint's body was translated from Jerusalem to Constantinople in the second half of the 6th century while others state that it was brought to Constantinople from Syria. The mentioning of the [[Dubrovnik Cathedral]] as his first resting place in Dalmatia after his transfer from Palestine also appears in a verse-chronicle of the [[Dubrovnik|Ragusan]] poet Miletius from 1159.&lt;/ref&gt; where it stayed until the year 1203 when it was then shipped to [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seymour Jr|first=Charles|title=The Tomb of Saint Simeon the Prophet in San Simeone Grande, Venice|year=1976|publisher=International Center of Medieval Art|pages=193|jstor=766767|OCLC=4893277455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madden|first=Thomas F.|title=International History Review|work=Vows and Contracts in the Fourth Crusade: The Treaty of Zara and the Attack on Constantinople in 1204|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|jstor=40106727|volume=15|pages=441–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Michael|title=The Last Era of Roman Magnificence: 12th Century Byzantium and the Kommenoi Emperors|work=Byzantium under the Kommenoi Emperors|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/46449324/The-Last-Era-of-Roman-Magnificence-12th-Century-Byzantium-and-the-Komnenoi-Emperors|publisher=Scribd|year=2011|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The surviving ''Pilgrim’s Book'', written by Daniel and Anthony of Novgorod, monk and archbishop of [[Novgorod]], during their visit to Constantinople in 1200, testifies that the relics of the saint were still in Istanbul at the time. Legends relate that his body arrived in Zadar in 1203, 1213, 1243 or 1273 respectively, but despite the many dates and places the theory that the Eastern emperor's nephew [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexius Angelus]] conspired with Venetians and Frankish crusaders to plounder the city of Zadar on their way to Constantinople in 1201 ([[Treaty of Venice]]) may sound quite possible to some researchers once the purpose of the plan was to defray part of the transporting cost of the expedition which the crusaders were unable to pay to Venice. In December 1202 Alexius IV promised aid and money in return for restoration to his throne, so like this the Treaty of Zara was signed in January 1203 and the [[Fourth Crusade]] proceeded against Christian Constantinople, despite protests from the Pope because the act represented a brutal assault on a Catholic town by Catholic troops. There is a mosaic in the Basilica of San Giovanni Batista in Ravenna, Italy, that portrays the invasion of Zadar by the crusaders (1208).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the tradition of the worship of St. Simeon at Zadar began after the arrival of a Venetian merchant there who was transporting the relics of the saint in a stone sarcophagus when his ship was caught in a storm off Zadar, on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. While the city repaired his ship, he secretly buried the sarcophagus in a cemetery nearby so as to keep it safe from any danger; soon after that he got very ill. He sought refuge at an inn at the head of Zadar's harbour,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This is the place where today stands the parish church of St. John.&lt;/ref&gt; where monks began to treat him. Seeing that his medical condition had worsened, they took all of his documents and found an inscription hanging around his neck reporting the miraculous powers of the saint. Oddly enough, that same night, three rectors appeared to them in a dream and warned each one individually that the remains of the holy saint were really buried in that said cemetery. Early in the following morning, as they walked to the site where they expected to find that stone sarcophagus, they told one another about their vision and so realised that they all had shared the same dream. They got to the grave where the chest had been hidden and dug it out of the ground, unaware of the real powers of its content. Shortly after that, gossips about this story reported by the monks and miracles performed in the name of the saint began to spread around the region inciting to the locals to refuse to let his body leave Zadar.&lt;ref name="Arambašić"/&gt;

When the remains of St. Simeon first came to Zadar they were deposed in the cemetery of a suburban monastery (Church of the Virgin - ''Velika Gospa''),&lt;ref name="Marijan"/&gt; which later became associated with the city's pilgrims hospice, until they were transferred to the sacristy of the female monastery of [[St. Mary Major]], where they remained until its demolition to make room for the construction of the city walls in 1570.&lt;ref name="Bousfield"&gt;Bousfield  Jonathan (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UxSnm-mUp40C&amp;pg=PA261 The Rough Guide to Croatia]'', Rough Guides, pp. 261. {{ISBN|1-84353-084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1632 they were transferred once more amid public rejoicing to a church consecrated to St. Stephen, the Martyr, and which subsequently came to be known as the Sanctuary of Saint [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon the Righteous]], the prophet of the [[Nunc dimittis|Nunc Dimittis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W Magazine|url=http://surecann.com/allthingscroatia/magazine2004.pdf|work=Churches and Cultural Attractions|format=pdf|publisher=All Things Croatia|accessdate=2 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830070933/http://surecann.com/allthingscroatia/magazine2004.pdf|archivedate=30 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then St. Simeon, one of the four patrons of Zadar, has been revered in the city.&lt;ref name="Marijan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marijan|first=Livio|title=Part of Relics of St. Simeon the Godbearer handed over by the Archbishop of Zadar to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|url=http://www.byzcath.org/index.php/news-mainmenu-49/3060-part-of-relics-of-st-simeon-the-godbearer-handed-over-by-the-archbishop-of-zadar-to-the-greek-orthodox-patriarchate-of-jerusalem|work=Press Release of the Archdiocese of Zadar|publisher=Byzantine Catholic Church in America|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The theft of the finger===
In 1371, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fabijančić, Tony (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sppa_IWNmosC&amp;pg=PA112 Croatia: travels in undiscovered country]'', The University of Alberta Press, pp. 112. {{ISBN|0-88864-397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]], and Queen of Hungary and Croatia as wife of one of the most powerful European rulers of his time, [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis I]], visited the city of Zadar.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Jelič, however, reported that this event happened during the king's entrance in Zadar and not in 1371.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, during a religious mass, she furtively cracked off a piece of St. Simeon's finger and hid it in the breast of her dress, where it immediately began to decompose, a process which miraculously reverted itself when she returned the piece to the saint's hand. Confused by the appearing wound on her bosom and without being able to continue up to the point where she could safely exit from the church, most probably because of the maggots that infested the broken piece,&lt;ref name="Bousfield"/&gt; she ran blindly through the aisle of the church only to find out that she would soon be morally forced to restore the piece back to its original place under the accusatory and inquisitive glances exchanged by the many noblemen who formed a circle around her.

[[File:HAZU 47 17 lipnja 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A replica of the chest as seen in the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]]]
When Elizabeth finally left the church she promised to honour the saint by presenting the church with a gift ornated in gold that she later came to commission to the Milanese goldsmith Francesco di Antonio da Sesto (Francis of Milan), who was asked to create a paper model with drawings of all the details to be discussed and approved by the queen's representatives so that their legibility and presentation might be in accordance with the royal expectations and deep interest in the making of such precious shrine. The intricate carvings were dexterously executed between 1377 and 1380 and was  assisted by Andrija Markov from [[Zagreb]], Petar Blažev from Reča, Stejpan Pribičev and Mihovil Damjanov.&lt;ref name="Qantara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;Rossiter, Stuart (1969); ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dN0bAAAAMAAJ Yugoslavia: the Adriatic Coast]'', Benn, pp. 102. {{ISBN|0-510-02505-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Although Francis of Milan could have taken on assistants because of the urgency of the job, it is known today from documents that he only took on only one apprentice and one trained goldsmith who was engaged at the end of the work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The commission of the chest by Elizabeth is recorded in a document dated 5 July 1377 in Zadar. It reveals the techniques used in the making of the chest and also attests that the donation of the 240&amp;nbsp;kg of silver used to decorate the surface of the chest came from "Elizabeta" herself. It was most probably given to Zadar because the Royal couple needed the support of its people. Even being the commissioning of reliquary shrines a typical way by which medieval queens attempted to secure their political recognition, it was the period when the city frequently belonged to the [[Venetian Empire]] and the territory of the Croatian-Hungarian king. Thus Louis I, engaged in keeping Zadar away from the clutches of Venice, wanted a strong community to form a strong bond between the south Italian possessions and the Polish and Croatian-Hungarian state. For this reason, St. Simeon was the best choice for being the most popular saint in Zadar. But the Angevin chapter of Zadar's history, which began in 1350, ended in 1409 when [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the descendant of [[Elizabeth the Cuman]], sold Zadar and its duchy to the Venetian Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In 2007 the Archbishop of Zadar and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem agreed that the Archdiocese would provide a piece of the body of the saint to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem to be venerated in the Church of the Katamon Monastery of St. Simeon. Arrangements were made with the Congregation of Divine Worship and Cult of Saints in Rome and the small silver reliquiary, constraining a particle measuring 5 x 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm and bearing the Latin inscription: "Ex corporis Sancti Simeoni Iusti Zadar 7. octobris 2010", was solemnly handed over to the representatives of the Orthodox Church during the celebration of Vespers in the eastern part of the historic quarters of Zadar.&lt;ref name=Marijan /&gt;

==Description of the chest==

===Dimensions===
The rectangular silver chest of Saint Simeon, standing 2.3&amp;nbsp;m above the ground on the main altar of the church of the same name,&lt;ref name=Cilauro/&gt; measures 1.92&amp;nbsp;m long by 62.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide and, including the 56&amp;nbsp;cm high saddle-shaped lid, 1.27&amp;nbsp;m high.&lt;ref name="Qantara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Simeon's Shrine|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1454&amp;lang=en|publisher=Qantara - Mediterranean Heritage|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front side of the lid is dominated by the carved reclining figure of the saint dressed in a gown and cloak richly ornamented with plant motifs made by punching fastened on his breast by a clasp. The front panel, which unfolds by means of hinges located on the bottom displaying the saint's laid-down figure, measures 66.5&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt; It is raised by the outstretched arms of four bronze angels forged from seventeenth century Turkish cannons that were seized in the waters of Zadar in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Raos, Ivan (1969). ''[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=The+bronze+figures+bearing+the+coffin+of++Simeon+were+cast+from+Turkish+cannons+#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%22The+bronze+figures+bearing+the+coffin+of+St.+Simeon+were+cast+from+Turkish+cannons+seized+in+Zadar%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=7a8f28651437ace4 Adriatic tourist guide]'', Spektar, pp. 113. {{OCLC|112865}} on [[Google Search]] Retrieved 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Covered inside and outside with a thin lamina of 240&amp;nbsp;kg of pure silver and also a considerable quantity of gold, it shows intricate details carved on the cedar wood used to give shape to the chest. All free surface of the chest is filled in with more or less standard vine, leaves and winding rosettes of sinuate leaves ornamentations decorated with gold.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"&gt;Petricioli, Ivo. (1996). ''Artistic innovations on the silver shrine of St. Simeon in Zadar'', Hortus artium medievalium (vol. II), Zagreb - Motovun, pp. 9-17. {{OCLC|34729563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt;

===Relief compositions===
The front part of the chest displays enhanced relief compositions depicting scenes from the saint's early years as a preacher, death and ascension into heaven on the back of a virgin,&lt;ref name="Cilauro"&gt;Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Rob Sitch (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3K3hp3fOJtMC&amp;pg=PA58 Molvania: a land untouched by modern dentistry]'';  Hardie Grant Books, pp. 58. {{ISBN|978-1-74066-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as biblical and historical events of his time. The inside part contains a relief made by goldsmith Stjepan Martinič of Zadar representing the patron saints of the city in the background.&lt;ref name=Qantara/&gt; The inside of the lid is magnificently illustrated with three miracles attributed to the saint. His holy monk-like figure and two sets of the arms of Anjou also appear in high relief on both the triangle areas of the lid. They are both richly decorated in the same manner together with the shield of Hungarian bars and the characteristic Angevin fleur-de-lis, a cloak and a helmet with a crown. Above the crowns rises an ostrich with outspread wings and a horseshoe in its beak. Around the coat of arms there are reliefs of [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves, and beside them the initials of the king: L.R. ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Lodovicus Rex'').&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The same coat of arms in the shape of a buckle can be found in the treasury of [[Aachen Cathedral]] once Ludvig I was the grandson of [[Charles Martel of Anjou|Charles Martel]], the son of [[Charles II of Naples]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAZU 48 17 lipnja 2008.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The Latin inscription.]]
The Latin inscription on the central panel on the back of the chest, which corresponds to the main composition on the front panel, bears the goldsmith's signature with Louis's coat of arms in the corners of the richly worked vine tracery that complements the relief. It is divided in two parts, being the larger with the main inscription in Gothic capital letters beaten in high relief: "SYMEON: HI.C.IVSTVS.YEXVM.DE.VIRGINE.NATVM.VLNIS: QVI.TENVITHAC.ARCHA. PACE.QVIESCIT.HVNGARIE.REGINA.POTENS: ILLVSTRIS: ED.ALTA: ELYZABET.IUNIOR:QVAM.VOTO:CONTVLIT. ALMO.ANNO.MILLENO: TRECENO: OCTVAGENO." Below, angraved in stylized minuscule letters, appears the goldsmith's signature: "hoc.opus.fecit: franciscus.d.mediolano."&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;

Known in medieval Latin hexameters, the translation of the inscription reads as follows: "Simeon the Righteous, holding Jesus, born of a virgin, in his arms, rests in peace in this chest, commissioned by the Queen of Hungary, mighty, glorious and majestic Elizabeth the Younger, in the year 1380. This is the work of Francis of Milan".&lt;ref name=Marijan/&gt;

===Main scenes===
The scenes are separated by columns surmounted by small heads of angels sculpted during the two-year restoration process started in 1630.&lt;ref name="Qantara"/&gt; The work was conducted by the goldsmiths Constantino Piazzalonga of Venice and Benedetto Libani of Zadar, who reduced the length of the chest by four and the width by three fingers.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 1"&gt;Petricioli, Ivo (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5osAQAAIAAJ St. Simeon's shrine in Zadar]'', Drago Zdunić, pp. 26-31. {{OCLC|12301571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sir Thomas Graham (1887).

*'''The Arrival of King Louis I in Zadar''', the right scene on the front panel depicting the town walls, gates and ramparts, includes a Romanesque cloister beside a church, a contemporary ship in a storm and several figures clad in garments with caps typical of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Ivančević, Radovan (1986). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6OfAAAAMAAJ Art treasures of Croatia]'', IRO Motovun - Belgrade: Jugoslovenska revija, pg. 97, {{OCLC|18052634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis I triumphantly enters the Zadar harbour dressed in ceremonial robes escorting the shrine, which is being carried in the middleground, after relieving the city from an eighteen-month siege. To the left of the king are five figures kneeling humbly and above them the short-bearded figure of Archbishop Nikola Matafar blessing the king.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;From a historical point of view, this is the most interesting piece of work as it interprets an almost contemporary event to the making of the chest. The returning of the saint's body to the place from which the Venetians had probably removed him during their ten-year-long rule, although this information is not confirmed in historical sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Presentation in the Temple''', the central relief on the front panel, is one depicting St. Simeon taking into his arms the infant Jesus under a four-squared-column ciborium. To the left stands Joseph holding a pigeon, and to the right the prophetess Anne holding an unrolled scroll in her left hand.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 1"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The central relief on the front of the chest, is believed to be a work based on a [[fresco]] by [[Giotto]], in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] (Cappella dell'Arena) in [[Padua]], or it might be a work based on another of Giotto's smaller paintings today in the Gardner Museum in Boston. This way Francis of Milan introduced the work of this grand master to [[Dalmatia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Discovery of the Saint's Body''', the scene on the left-hand side of the frontal panel shows a group of three rectors on the left bottom corner. The first has lifted a forefinger while the central figure has raised two, one in each hand. The third is pointing his left thumb over his shoulder at the other monks exhuming the body of the saint. The left monk swings a hoe above his head while the central figure kneels and holds a lantern, which shows that the scene takes place at night. The third monk is kneeling and taking care of the saint's naked body.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Writers agree that this composition depicts the finding of St. Simeon's body in a cemetery of a Zadar suburban monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Boat in the Storm''' is the scene on the right shorter side of the chest, by the saints feet, where the drama of a situation showing high waves bearing the sides of a large sailing ship and sailors jettisoning goods overboard is very expressively shown. It is believed that it interprets the story of how the bones of St. Simeon came to Zadar. A monstrous horned demon is clutching one of the two masts of the ship while two rushed sailors desperately try to fasten the sail. One has climbed up the mast and is taking a rope which the other is passing over to him. A third sailor is throwing a bundle of merchandise in the sea while the captain, on an elevated stern holding the helm, gives orders to the sailors. The frightened passengers are gathered on the center of the ship.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This is an artistically important motif for also being reminiscent of [[Giovanni di Balduccio]]'s stone relief on the sarcophagus of St. Eustorgius in Milan. Older writers have the opinion that this scene is a despiction of the boat that brought the &amp;nbsp;saint's relics to Zadar and that it tells the legend of [[Margaret of Durazzo]], wife of Duke [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], Ludvig's relative, who took part of the saint's body and tried to leave Naples, but the boats which were to take them and their suite could not sail out of the harbour.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Theft of the Finger''' is the scene located beneath the other coat of arms, on the shorter side of the chest, by the saint's head. It has been interpreted in many ways because of the large number of figures represented.&lt;ref name="Gyug"&gt;Gyug, Richard Francis; (2002), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JEcVlPQjl24C&amp;pg=PA62 Medieval cultures in contact]'', [[Fordham University Press]], pp. 62. {{ISBN|0-8232-2212-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Research Center for Late Antiquity and Middle Ages (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn_rAAAAMAAJ Hortus artium medievalium]'', The Center, pp. 225 (Vol. 10). {{OCLC|34729563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burdick, Lewis Dayton (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HcQDUxTlET0C&amp;pg=PA44 The hand: a survey of facts, legends, and beliefs pertaining to manual]'', [[Purdue University Press]], pp. 44. {{ISBN|1-55753-294-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stylized building symbolizing a church where the scene takes place and a large group of people ornately dressed around a woman similarly dressed with her left hand pointing to her bosom dominate the center of this composition. A point-bearded nobleman of long hair in very nice attire stands beside her and another with a cloak over his clothes seems to point to the door while he looks at the woman standing by the chest. Around them, other nobles with long plumes in their caps show signs of great surprise. In the right bottom, the saint's chest with its lid open and a woman dressed in the same way appears holding a wide finger in her hand.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Older writers say that this scene shows Elizabeta stealing one of St. Simeon's fingers in order to have a male heir. St. Simeon was frequently invoked for couples wishing to have a boy and the belief of stealing the finger of a saint dates at least from the time of the hagiographer [[Gregory of Tours]]. Ancient Romans consecrated every joint of the fingers of both hands to a saint and St. Simeon figures as the first joint of the middle finger of the left hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Death of Ban Kotromanič''' is a two-part scene where the Queen's father appears on his deathbed with St. Simeon and a boy invoking aid in the foreground. Beyond him lies the bed with the sick man and two women, who can only be seen from their waist up, standing in front of a curtain. Another boy is shown on the right with his hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;As the Queen's father was a [[Ban of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]], and Bosnian rulers were often accused of the [[Bogomilism|Bogumil heresy]], writers say that this scene is meant to show that he was a good Catholic and that the two boys represent the Ban's nephews Tvrtko and Vuk, who came to Zadar to entreat the saint to protect their uncle. Other writers suggest that both boys personify only the eldest of the two, who was crowned King of Bosnia and Serbia in October 1377.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''Queen Elizabeth with her daughters presenting the chest to the saint''' is the scene which appears to the left of the Latin inscription and that shows Elizabeth ceremoniously dressed in a long cloak edged with a decorated band and a fur collar that wraps her entire body and feet. Her three daughters, [[Catherine of Hungary (1370–1378)|Catherine]], [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]] and [[Jadwiga of Poland|Hedwig]],&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt; are shown more simply dressed looking at the saint with their hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Catherine (1370-1378) was seven years old, Mary (1371-1395) six and Hedwig (1373-1399) almost four at the time of the commissioning of the chest, so this relief must have been finished when Elizabeth's eldest daughter was still alive.&lt;/ref&gt;

!'''Compositions located on the inside part of the front panel.'''
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Possessed Nobleman''' is the first of the three miracles carved on the internal surface of the front panel, which opens in order to show the saint's body. It is depicted in two parts, with the first showing a young man with no beard and an older one with long hair and a beard, simply dressed and tightly holding a nobleman possessed by a demon, who is coming out of his mouth. In the second scene the younger man is kneeling with clasped hands thanking the saint for the healing.
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Young Boy's Resurrection''', the second scene, shows a small boat on a stormy sea and a man in it with a long hair and beard, and a tall cap on his head, rescuing a young boy out of the sea with a hook on a long staff. The second part of the scene shows a woman in a long cloak with her head covered laying the drowned boy on the chest. The same boy, brought back to life, can be seen kneeling with his hands clasped in the bottom left corner of the relief.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These figures showing the same boy were not connected in literature and therefore were first wrongly described as two miracles instead of only one, however all three characters bear the same features, hair and attire in this composition.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Preaching of a Heretic Priest''', depicting the third miracle performed by the saint, is a scene in which a priest is shown in a pulpit under two pictures. The first is an illustration of Christ in the grave and the second the Virgin holding the infant Jesus. He is holding an open book in his left hand and pointing to the picture of the Virgin with his right. A great part of the surface of this relief is taken up by a large bed where the same priest is lying, naked as was the costume at the time. A bench and a curtain in the background compose the scene. Behind the bed stands St. Simeon raising a sword with his right hand.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This scene has been interpreted as the preaching of the priest who attacked some religious teaching concerning the Virgin, so St. Simeon appeared in his dream with a sword and threatened him, so steering him to the right path of life.&lt;/ref&gt;

!'''Compositions located on the back of the lid.'''
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Prejurer''' is one of the three scenes on the back of the lid. It depicts a building with arches on the ground floor and a man dressed in a long and wide coat falling beside it. To the right of the chest, a group of eight men are shown. The first of the two m an who appear entirely described, is touching the lid of the chest with his right hand while his left is held around the other who has clasped his hands. The bust of a third also appears, but only the crown of the remaining five heads are shown. A priest is shown watching the group.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According with some writers, this composition shows either some false oath or a sacrilege committed by that man.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Goldsmith''' is the central composition and shows only three figures. A man kneeling on one leg before the saint's chest on posts with goldsmith's tools in his hand. He is looking at a bald-headed younger man kneeling by a column and a female figure with her head covered and wrapped in a long cloak is shown standing in front of an arch.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The content of this relief has not been well explained. The figure kneeling by the post seems to represent the goldsmith working in the church who appears surprised by the arrival of the young man accompanied by the woman.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|align="center"|
*'''The Miracle with the Leg''' is the right-hand scene which depicts a group of four priests gathered behind the chest and a fifth at its right holding one of the saints legs with his right arm and the other raised up to his chin.&lt;ref name="Petricioli 2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This composition is considered by some writers to also represent the punishment of a prejurer whose sin was to become a madman for the stealing of the saint's leg, which miraculously grew together with the body again after being sent back to Zadar.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

'''Note''': The visual narrative of ''The Theft of the Finger'' and two other scenes located on the back part of the chest have recently been considered to be all connected.&lt;ref name="Munk"&gt;Munk, Ana (2004). ''The Queen and Her Shrine: An Art Historical Twist on Historical Evidence Concerning the Hungarian Queen Elizabeth, née Kotromanić, Donor of the Saint Simeon Shrine'', International Research Center for Late Antiquity and Middle Ages and International Centres of Croatian Universities, pp. 255 {{ISSN|1330-7274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such conclusion may differ from another line of thoughts who point to a longer narrative based on a chronological sequence of events, which begins with the scene ''The Boat in the Storm'', shifts from visual to written discourse in the reading of the Latin inscription on the back panel, and ends in the complementary scene ''The Death of Ban Kotromanić''.&lt;ref name="Munk"/&gt;

The "XX Chromosome Genome Project" by S. Ann Johnson is a modern example of a choreopoem. It combines poetry, song and dance to illuminate the commonalities and differences between women of various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The XX Chromosome Genome Project by S. Ann Johnson|url=http://www.twopensandlint.com/sannjohnson/|publisher=2 Pens &amp; Lint LLC|accessdate= May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this choreopoem, Johnson writes about eight women in search of self-acceptance and liberation. These colorfully dressed women, who are named after flavors of foods, represent international cultures around the world through music, spoken word, and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matema|first=ZSun-Nee|title=‘XX Chromosome Genome Project’ at Hamilton Arts Center|url=http://www.dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2013/06/29/xx-chromosome-genome-project-at-hamilton-arts-center-by-zsun-nee-matema/|publisher=DC Metro Theater Arts|accessdate= May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Influenced by women from the [[Black Arts Movement]], based on [[Black Nationalism]] that encouraged [[black separatism]], and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist arts movement]], which focused on using art of various mediums as acts against war and in favor of civil and homosexual rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm#|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate= May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange wanted to create a genre that was interdisciplinary and allowed for performers to use all senses of the body. Working closely with choreographer [[Dianne McIntyre]], Shange was able to confront her childhood experiences through movement. McIntyre helped to choreograph ''for colored girls'' with Shange, as they wanted to convey awareness and community through dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Brooks| first=Kara |title=Ntozake Shange on Why She Had to Dance| url=http://oberlinreview.org/4505/arts/4505/|accessdate= May 11, 2014|newspaper=The Oberlin Review|date= February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of movement and dance in a choreopoem was as essential to her as the poetry aspect. Shange described that "with dance (she) discovered (her) body more intimately than (she) had imagined possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Collins| first=Lisa| title=Activists Who Yearn for Art That Transforms: Parallels in the Black Arts and Feminist Art Movements in the United States| journal=| volume=31| issue=3| pages=717–752 | doi=10.1086/498991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange’s emphasis on dance was a result of her experience with [[African dance]] and movement classes as well as her exposure to [[Santeria]] through dance and music as it relates to African dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Effiong|first=Philip|title=Ntozake Shange’s Choreopoem: Reinventing a Heritage of Poetry and  Dance|url=http://www.philip-effiong.com/Shange-Choreopoem.pdf|accessdate= May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her choreopoems, Shange tends to focus on “self-awareness, self-definition, and solidarity”.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

&lt;!-- Not sure if this part is necessary: information about Shange is not necessarily applicable to an article on choreopoems. Though the movement was started by Shange, if Shange's choreopoems are discussed here, it would only be fair to discuss all the others as well, which is not very practical.
Although influenced by these movements, Shange felt as though black women were not included. In response, she uses her writing to elaborate on women of color’s experiences in her works with choreopoems while expanding the definition of black womanhood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Lisa|title=Activists Who Yearn for Art That Transforms: Parallels in the Black Arts and Feminist Art Movements in the United States|journal=|volume=31|issue=3|pages=717–752 |doi=10.1086/498991}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
--&gt;
Many choreopoems were performed with African-American cultural inspiration but were not focused on black separatism. These choreopoems were focused upon teaching the culture and history of Africans and Americans of African descent to all comers interested in learning.
Seattle's Choreopoets held this philosophy. Members of the Choreopoets included Mary Stone Hanley&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine R. Grumet, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [http://soe.unc.edu/news_events/slate/slate_winter01.pdf "School Welcomes Five New Colleagues"], Winter 2001.

[[File:CODICOLOGY.jpg|thumb|upright|Codicological signs]]
'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the [[Arrowverse|television programs]], was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed five films. The series has grossed over $3.7 billion at the global box office, currently making it the [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourteenth highest-grossing film franchise]].

The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]], casts. Several actors, including [[Henry Cavill]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]], and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], have appeared in numerous films of the franchise, with continued appearances in sequels planned. In May 2016, DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the [[DC Films]] division and oversee creative decisions, production and [[Story arc|story-arcs]] in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. In January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the president of DC Films, replacing Berg.

The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), and ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018). The franchise will continue with scheduled release dates for ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' in 2019, as well as ''[[DC Extended Universe#Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (2020)|Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn)]]'' and ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' scheduled for release in 2020. A multitude of other projects are in various stages of development.

== Additional materials ==

[[File:BvS Communion Scene Steppenwolf.png|thumb|right|The "Communion" scene in ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' teases the events in ''Justice League'', showing the villain [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] and the three [[Mother Box]]es.]]

In order to expand and build the universe the films are set in, some additional material has been released, such as additional scenes or bonus material included in the home releases of the films. The purpose of said material is also to set up and tease the overarching narrative that future installments of the franchise will adhere to. In the case of additional scenes, on March 28, 2016, Warner Bros. released to the public via its YouTube channel, a scene not shown in theaters from ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', titled "Communion", which teased the events that would be depicted in ''Justice League''; the scene was later integrated in the Ultimate Edition home release of the film. Similarly, in the Blu-ray disc home release of ''Wonder Woman'', an epilogue is included in the form of a [[short film|short]] titled "Etta's Mission", which details a final incident that transpired after the events of the film. Etta teases the existence of a Mother Box, which is crucial to the storyline of ''Justice League''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Jacks |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1697329/how-the-new-wonder-woman-epilogue-will-connect-to-justice-league |title=How The New Wonder Woman Epilogue Will Connect To Justice League |website=Cinemablend.com |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the Blu-ray home release of ''Justice League'', two additional scenes not shown in the theatrical cut are included, which further flesh-out the return of Superman and him joining the League.

Furthermore, the various special featurettes and documentaries included in the Blu-ray home releases of the films feature concept arts and designs, as well as background information that greatly expands the shared universe; giving detailed insight into the fictional history, technology, worlds and cultures that appear in the films.

Although not all the films in the franchise resort to this practice, some of them make use of [[post-credits scene]]s to further develop character relationships and establish the plot elements that will influence future installments, such as ''Suicide Squad'' and ''Justice League''.

'''Databending''' (or '''data bending''') is the process of manipulating a [[media file]] of a certain [[File format|format]], using [[software]] designed to edit files of another format. Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in [[glitch art]].

==Process and techniques==
The term ''databending'' is derived from [[circuit bending]], in which objects such as children's toys, [[effects pedal]]s and electronic keyboards are deliberately [[short circuit]]ed by bending the [[circuit board]] to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending,&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of its target's behavior. Databending achieves this alteration by manipulating the information within a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of a different format; distortions in the medium typically occur as a result.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt;  

Many techniques exist, including the use of [[hex editor]]s to manipulate certain components of a [[compression algorithm]], to comparatively simple methods.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; [[Michael Betancourt]] has posed a short set of instructions, included in the [[Signal Culture |''Signal Culture Cookbook,'']] that involves the direct manipulation of the digital file using a hexadecimal editing program. One such method involves the addition of audio effects through [[audio editing software]] to distort [[raw data]] interpretations of image files. Some effects produce optical analogues: adding an [[echo]] filter duplicated elements of a photo, and inversion contributed to the flipping over of an image. The similarities result from the waveforms corresponding with the layers of pixels in a [[Linear medium|linear fashion]], ordered from top to bottom.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; Another method, dubbed "the WordPad effect", uses the program [[WordPad]] to manipulate images through converting the raw data to the [[Rich Text Format]].&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

===Categorization===
According to the artist Benjamin Berg, different techniques of the process can be grouped into three categories:&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;
* Incorrect editing: Files of a certain format are manipulated using software designed to edit files of a different format.
* Reinterpretation: Files are simply converted from one medium to another.
* Forced errors: Known [[software bug]]s are exploited to force the program to terminate, usually while writing a file.
The "WordPad effect" would fall under ''incorrect editing'', while ''reinterpretation'' contains a subcategory called ''sonification'', in which data other than audio is introduced simultaneously with musical audio data. The last technique is the hardest of the three to accomplish, often yielding highly unpredictable results.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

==Usage and reception==
[[File:NicolaiRasterNotonLive.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alva Noto uses sonification in his music.]]
Databending is frequently employed in [[glitch art]],&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; and is considered a sub-category of the genre.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; The ''sonification'' technique is commonly used by [[glitch music]]ians such as [[Alva Noto]].&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Ahuja and Lu summarized the process through a quote by Adam Clark Estes of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' as "the internet's code-heavy version of graffiti."&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2013"/&gt; Various groups on [[Flickr]] explore the effects of databending on imagery; an [[Internet bot]] named "GlitchBot" was created to scrape [[Creative Commons]]-licensed imagery and apply the process and upload the results.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Users on [[Vimeo]] who deal explicitly with databending and glitch art in general exist, and a [[Chicago]]-based digital art project named GLI.TC/H was funded using [[Kickstarter]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weber2011"/&gt;

'''''Daybreak''''' is a painting by American artist [[Maxfield Parrish]] made in 1922. ''Daybreak'' is regarded as the most popular art print of the 20th century, based on number of [[Printmaking|prints]] made: one for every four American homes. According to the [[National Museum of American Illustration]], it has outsold [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' and [[Da Vinci]]'s ''[[Last Supper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanillustration.org/html/press/press_7_5_06.html |title=Press Release |publisher=The National Museum of American Illustration |date=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211183835/http://www.americanillustration.org/html/press/press_7_5_06.html |archivedate=2007-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in print.

Parrish referred to ''Daybreak'' as his "great painting", the epitome of his work. 

== Composition ==
Measuring {{convert|26.5|x|45|in|cm|sigfig=3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Alma |title=Maxfield Parrish: The Masterworks |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |date=1992 |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; the painting employs a formal layout similar to a stage set, with two feminine figures. Painted using preparatory photographs, the models were his regular models, Kitty Owen (granddaughter of [[William Jennings Bryan]]), Parrish's daughter Jean, and Susan Lewin. Only two figures appear in the completed painting, though pencil studies indicate that the artist originally intended a third near the righthand column.&lt;ref name="Ludwig" /&gt; The composition is arranged on the principle of "[[The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry|dynamic symmetry]]" popularized by [[Jay Hambidge]].&lt;ref name="Ludwig"&gt;{{cite book |first=Coy |last=Ludwig |title=Maxfield Parrish |publisher=Watson-Guptil |date=1973 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Record purchase price ==
The painting has always been in private ownership. On May 25, 2006, ''Daybreak'' was purchased by a private collector ([[Mel Gibson]]'s then-wife, Robyn) at auction at [[Christie's]] for [[United States dollar|US $]]7.6 million. This set a record price for a Parrish painting. It was sold again on May 21, 2010 for US $5.2 million.

==In popular culture==
* In 1995 [[Michael Jackson]] produced a music video, "[[You Are Not Alone]]", featuring himself and his then wife, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in which they appear semi-nude in emulation of Daybreak.
* The [[Bloom County]] comic book ''[[Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things]]'' features a cover with many elements of ''Daybreak'' and other works by Parrish.
* The [[Dalis Car]] album cover "The Waking Hour" uses a detail from ''Daybreak''.
* [[The Moody Blues]] 1983 album ''[[The Present]]'' features cover artwork that uses a variation of ''Daybreak''.
* A 1986 Nestle television commercial for Alpine White features one scene imitating ''Daybreak'' and another resembling Parrish's ''Ecstasy''.
* The [[Saint Preux]] album "The Last Opera" also uses "Daybreak" for its cover.
* "Daybreak in O'Bryonville" (2009) is a Cincinnati mural designed for [[ArtWorks]] by contemporary artist [[Kate Holterhoff]]. Parrish's flowering vine motif figures prominently in Holterhoff's mural.

The word '''dentalium''', as commonly used by [[Native American art]]ists and [[anthropologist]]s, refers to tooth shells or [[tusk shell]]s used in indigenous jewelry, adornment, and commerce in western [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. These tusk shells are a kind of [[seashell]], specifically the shells of [[scaphopod]] [[mollusk]]s. The name "dentalium" is based on the [[scientific name]] for the [[genus]] ''[[Dentalium (genus)|Dentalium]]'', but because the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has changed over time, not all of the species used are still placed in that genus; however, all of the species are certainly in the family [[Dentaliidae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|dentalium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dentalium shells were used by [[Inuit]], [[First Nations]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as an international trade item. This usage is found along the western coast of [[Canada]] and along the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast of the northwest [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;James Ruppert and John W. Bernet, ''Our Voices: Native Stories of Alaska and the Yukon'', 2001, University of Toronto Press, 394 pages  {{ISBN|0-8020-8467-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending southward to [[Southern California]]. Traditionally, the shells of ''[[Antalis pretiosum]]'' (previously known as ''Dentalium pretiosum'', the precious dentalium (a species which occurs from [[Alaska]] to [[Baja California]]) were harvested from deep waters around the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast of [[North America]], especially off the coast of [[Vancouver Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://glimmerdream.com/gemjourneys/shells/history "Shells: Jewels of the Sea."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306074119/http://glimmerdream.com/gemjourneys/shells/history |date=2010-03-06 }} ''Glimmerdream.'' (retrieved 17 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Today most dentalium shells in the shell trade are smaller, more brittle, and are harvested from coasts off [[Asia]] — i.e. they are shells of [[Indo-Pacific]] species of scaphopods.

==Uses==

===Pacific Northwest===
[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 088.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wasco-Wishram|Wishram]] woman wearing a dentalium shell bridal headdress and earrings, photo by [[Edward Curtis]]]]
Peoples of the Northwest Pacific Coast would trade dentalium into the Great Plains, Great Basin, Central Canada, Northern Plateau and Alaska for other items including many foods, decorative materials, dyes, hides, [[macaw]] feathers which came from [[Central America]], [[turquoise]] from the American Southwest, as well as many other items.

[[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] peoples were the primary harvesters of dentalium shells. Among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coastal tribes]], the shells were valued for both trade and adornment. Young Nuu-chah-nulth girls of high status wore elaborate dentalium jewelry. When the jewelry was removed, a [[potlatch]] was held to celebrate and the girl would be considered eligible for marriage.&lt;ref name=d423&gt;Dubin, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athabaskan]] peoples of [[Alaska]] and subarctic Canada incorporate dentalium into jewelry with glass beads. Along with iron, these items were regarded as prestigious trade goods in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=d423/&gt;

Shells of the species ''Antalis pretiosum'' which had been gathered on the shores of Vancouver Island were first traded to the Canadian Plateau between 1000 and 1 BCE. During the 1st century CE, the shell was a common trade item in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Some very elite women from Plateau tribes wore dentalium shells through pierced [[nasal septum|septa]]. Elaborate bridal headdresses from the 19th and early 20th centuries, features dentalium shells strung on hide with Chinese brass coins and glass beads.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nlaka'pamux]] peoples have included dentalium shells in their relatives' burials. The shells are sometimes given away at memorial services.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
Dentalium shells are highly culturally significant to California tribes. [[Yurok people|Yurok]] oral history says that Pithváva, or "Big Dentalium," a deity, created that smaller dentalium and dictated their significance as sacred wealth. Among northern California tribes, dentalium was traditionally the most important unit of exchange – incorporated into regalia and used for gambling and commerce.&lt;ref name=Dubin1&gt;Dubin, pp. 436-437.&lt;/ref&gt; The shell's length and quality determined value. Highest quality shells would be about 2.25" long, and a dozen would typically be strung together, and a 27.5" string of dentalium was the price of a redwood [[dugout canoe]]. Certain men, who became known as "Indian bankers," tattooed marks on their arms with which to measure the length of the shells.&lt;ref name=Dubin1/&gt; Among northern California tribes, such as the Yurok, [[Karuk]], and [[Hupa]], dentalium shells were stored in elk-antler purses or treasure baskets.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;[[Alfred Kroeber]] accounted for the  &lt;ref name=Kroeber&gt;[[Alfred Kroeber|Kroeber, Alfred]]. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002494436 ''Handbook of the Indians of California.''] Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1925, pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Central Coast of California]], shells of ''[[Dentalium neohexagonum]]'' (a species that occurs from [[Monterey, California]] to [[Baja California]]) have been recovered from prehistoric habitation sites of the [[Chumash people|Chumash]], who apparently used these shells as tubes,&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18353 ''Los Osos Back Bay''], The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in [[jewelry]].

===Great Plains===
Among [[Plains Indians]], dentalium shells have traditionally been associated with wealth and embellished women's capes, yokes of dresses, hair ornaments, necklaces, and long, dangling earrings.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
Dentalium shell is still used today in Native American and Inuit regalia.

'''Dorothy Bohm''' is a [[photographer]] based in [[London]], known for her portraiture, [[street photography]], early adoption of colour, and photography of London and Paris; she is considered one of the [[doyen]]nes of British photography.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Boyd, "[http://www.manchestergalleries.org/dorothybohm/biography/ Biography and life in Manchester]", Manchester Art Gallery. Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Bohm was born '''Dorothea Israelit''' in 1924 in [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), to a German-speaking family of Jewish-Lithuanian origins.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Ford, "Dorothy Bohm: A Life in Photography", David Hawkins, ed., ''A World Observed, 1940&amp;ndash;2010: Photographs by Dorothy Bohm'' (London: Philip Wilson; Manchester: Manchester Art Gallery, 2010), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1932 to 1939 she lived with her family in Lithuania, first in Memel (now [[Klaipėda]]) and later in [[Šiauliai]]. She was sent to [[England]] in 1939 to escape Nazism: first to a boarding school in [[Ditchling]], Sussex, but London soon to Manchester, where her brother was a student, and where she met Louis Bohm (whom she would marry in 1945).&lt;ref name="manmemoir"&gt;Dorothy Bohm, "[http://www.manchestergalleries.org/dorothybohm/biography/memoir/ Manchester Memoir]" (2007), Manchester Art Gallery. Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dossier"&gt;[http://carnavalet.paris.fr/sites/default/files/dossier_de_presse_dorothy_bohm.pdf Press dossier] (PDF) for the exhibition ''Un Amour de Paris'', Musée Carnavalet, 2005. {{Fr icon}} Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Bohm studied photography at the [[Manchester Municipal College of Technology]], from which she received a diploma; she also received a certificate in photography from [[City and Guilds of London Art School|City and Guilds]]. She had worked under the photographer Samuel Cooper for four years until she set up her own portrait studio, Studio Alexander, in 1946 using her ''nom de guerre'' '''Dorothy Alexander'''.&lt;ref name="manmemoir" /&gt; (She would sell the studio in 1958.&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt;) Samples from this early portrait work would be exhibited decades later.&lt;ref name="howweare"&gt;Val Williams and Susan Bright, eds, ''How We Are: Photographing Britain from the 1840s to the Present'' (London: Tate Publishing, 2007; {{ISBN|978-1-85437-714-2}}), pp.&amp;nbsp;106, 107, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm's husband worked for a petrochemical company that obliged him to move around the world.&lt;ref name="manmemoir" /&gt; In 1947 she made the first of several visits to Paris, where she lived with her husband from 1954 to 1955. In the 1950s she also lived in New York and San Francisco,&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt; in 1956 travelling to Mexico, where she photographed in [[Color photography|colour]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="manobserved"&gt;[http://www.manchestergalleries.org/about-us/press-office/press-releases/index.php?itemID=35 Exhibition notice] for ''A World Observed 1940–2010'', Manchester Art Gallery, 1 March 2010. Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has lived in [[Hampstead]] since 1956.&lt;ref name="smyth" /&gt;

By the late 1950s, Dorothy Bohm had abandoned studio portraiture in favour of 'street photography', but was still working predominantly in [[Black-and-white|black and white]]; in 1980 she was persuaded by [[André Kertész]] to experiment with colour, which she did for two years using a [[Polaroid SX-70]] instant camera. She used colour negative film from 1984, and from 1985 worked exclusively in colour.&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt;

This early work of Bohm's has been described by Monica Bohm-Duchen as ‘humanist street photography, capturing the moment in the manner of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]’ whilst ‘people are often surprised by the youth and vibrancy of her colour work. She focuses on fragments of the urban landscape .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that are otherwise overlooked. These photographs have an abstract quality; there’s a deliberate spatial ambiguity and you’re not quite sure what you’re looking at. But nothing is manipulated – she will still only work with film.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creativetourist.com/city-guides/bohm-photography-exhibition |title="A World Observed: Dorothy Bohm" |accessdate=2010-03-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063448/http://www.creativetourist.com/city-guides/bohm-photography-exhibition |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}, Creativetourist.com. Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major 1969 exhibition in the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] of photography by Bohm, [[Don McCullin]], [[Tony Ray-Jones]] and [[Enzo Ragazzini]] drew a response that encouraged one of its organizers, Sue Davies, to embark on a photography gallery for London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Turner (writer and photographer)|Peter Turner]], ''History of Photography'' (Twickenham: Hamlyn, 1987; {{ISBN|0-600-50270-8}}), p.208.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Bohm co-founded [[The Photographers' Gallery]] in London with Davies; she worked as its Associate Director for the next 15 years, making many friends among the notable photographers who exhibited there.&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt; She visited South Africa for five weeks in 1974, later exhibiting photographs taken there.&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt; With Helena Kovac, she also founded the Focus Gallery for Photography in 1998; the gallery closed in 2004.&lt;ref name="dossier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smyth"&gt;Diane Smyth, "[http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/preview/1650061/dorothy-bohm The life and work of Dorothy Bohm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706094329/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/preview/1650061/dorothy-bohm |date=6 July 2013 }}", ''British Journal of Photography,'' 7 April 2010. Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Honorary-Fellowships List of honorary fellowships], Royal Photographic Society.

Accessed 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Bohm has said about her work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The photograph fulfils my deep need to stop things from disappearing. It makes transience less painful and retains something of the special magic, which I have looked for and found. I have tried to create order out of chaos, to find stability in flux and beauty in the most unlikely places.&lt;ref name="manobserved" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Fifth Avenue''' is a major [[thoroughfare]] in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It stretches north from [[Washington Square Park]] in [[Greenwich Village]] to [[143rd Street (Manhattan)|West 143rd Street]] in [[Harlem]]. It is considered one of the most expensive and elegant streets in the world.&lt;ref name="huffpost 20100921"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/21/the-worlds-most-expensive_1_n_733301.html|title=Fifth Avenue The World's Most Expensive Shopping Street (PHOTOS) (Subtext: "For the 9th year in a row, Fifth Avenue between 39th and 60th Streets ranks first among Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Main Streets Across the World Report, according to the New York Post.")|publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes 19970429"/&gt;

==History==

Originally a narrower thoroughfare, much of Fifth Avenue south of [[Central Park]] was widened in 1908, sacrificing its wide sidewalks to accommodate the increasing traffic. The midtown blocks, now famously commercial, were largely a residential district until the start of the 20th century. The first commercial building on Fifth Avenue was erected by [[B. Altman and Company|Benjamin Altman]] who bought the corner lot on the northeast corner of [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] in 1896, and demolished the [[280 Broadway|"Marble Palace"]] of his arch-rival, [[Alexander Turney Stewart|A. T. Stewart]]. In 1906 his department store, [[B. Altman and Company]], occupied the whole of its block front. The result was the creation of a high-end shopping district that attracted fashionable women and the upscale stores that wished to serve them. [[Lord &amp; Taylor]]'s flagship store is still located on Fifth Avenue near the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[New York Public Library]].

In the 1920s, traffic towers controlled important intersections from 14th to 59th Streets.

==Description==

Fifth Avenue originates at [[Washington Square Park]] in [[Greenwich Village]] and runs northwards through the heart of [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], along the eastern side of [[Central Park]], where it forms the boundary of the [[Upper East Side]] and through [[Harlem]], where it terminates at the [[Harlem River]] at 142nd Street. Traffic crosses the river on the [[Madison Avenue Bridge]]. Fifth Avenue serves as the dividing line for [[house numbering]] and west-east streets in Manhattan, just as [[Jerome Avenue]] does in [[the Bronx]]. It separates, for example, East 59th Street from West 59th Street.

From this zero point for ''street'' addresses, numbers increase in both directions as one moves away from Fifth Avenue,  The building lot numbering system worked similarly on the East Side as well, before Madison &amp; Lexington Aves. were retrofitted into the street grid, confusing the building numbers.  
Confusingly, an address on a cross street cannot be predicted at the intersection of Madison Ave. or Lexington Ave., as these were added decades after the building numbers.  It's as if the two retrofitted avenues are not counted for purposes of cross street addresses.

The "most expensive street in the world" moniker changes depending on currency fluctuations and local economic conditions from year to year. For several years starting in the mid-1990s, the shopping district between 49th and [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Streets]] was ranked as having the world's most expensive retail spaces on a cost per square foot basis.&lt;ref name="nytimes 19970429"&gt;Foderaro, Lisa W.

Retrieved February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked Fifth Avenue as being the most expensive street in the world. Some of the most coveted real estate on Fifth Avenue are the penthouses perched atop the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.NYCPenthouses.com|title=- Manhattan NYC New York Penthouses for Sale and Rent.

The [[American Planning Association]] (APA) compiled a list of "2012 Great Places in America" and declared Fifth Avenue to be one of the greatest streets to visit in America. This historic street has many world-renowned museums, businesses and stores, parks, luxury apartments, and historical landmarks that are reminiscent of its history and vision for the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/ Great Places in America]. Planning.org (February 24, 2011). Retrieved July 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018 portions of Fifth Avenue had  large numbers of vacant store fronts for long periods, part of a citywide trend of vacant store fronts attributed to high rental costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/06/nyregion/nyc-storefront-vacancy.html|title=The Empty Storefronts of New York: A Panoramic View|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traffic pattern===

Fifth Avenue from [[142nd Street (Manhattan)|142nd Street]] to [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] carries [[Bidirectional traffic|two-way traffic]]. Fifth Avenue carries [[one-way traffic]] southbound from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] to [[Waverly Place (Manhattan)|Washington Square North]]. The changeover to one-way traffic south of 135th Street took place on January 14, 1966, at which time [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] was changed to one way uptown (northbound).&lt;ref&gt;Kihbaconss, Peter.

====Parade route====
Fifth Avenue is the traditional route for many celebratory [[parade]]s in New York City; thus, it is closed to traffic on numerous Sundays in warm weather. The longest running parade is the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. Parades held are distinct from the ''[[ticker-tape parade]]s'' held on the ''"[[Canyon of Heroes]]"'' on lower [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] held on Broadway from the [[Upper West Side]] downtown to [[Herald Square]]. Fifth Avenue parades usually proceed from south to north, with the exception of the [[LGBT Pride March (New York City)|LGBT Pride March]], which goes north to south to end in [[Greenwich Village]]. The Latino literary classic by New Yorker [[Giannina Braschi]], entitled "Empire of Dreams," takes place on the [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]] on Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bookfest/author/giannina_braschi|title=Giannina Braschi|work=National Book Festival|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|quote=’Braschi, one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today’ is the author of Empire of Dreams.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marting|first1=Diane|title= New/Nueva York in Giannina Braschi's 'Poetic Egg': Fragile Identity, Postmodernism, and Globalization|place=Indiana|publisher=The Global South|pages=167–182|date=2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bicycling route====
[[Cycling in New York City|Bicycling on Fifth Avenue]] ranges from segregated with a [[bike lane]] south of [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], to scenic along [[Central Park]], to dangerous through Midtown with very heavy traffic during rush hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bike/cwbm.shtml New York City Cycling Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219231944/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bike/cwbm.shtml |date=February 19, 2016 }}, New York City Department of City Planning.

===Public transportation===
Fifth Avenue is one of the few major streets in Manhattan along which [[streetcar]]s did not operate. Instead, [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company and Surface Transit|Fifth Avenue Coach]] offered a service more to the taste of fashionable gentlefolk, at twice the fare. Double-decker buses were operated by the Fifth Avenue Coach Company until 1953, and again by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] from 1976 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Neuman, William [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/nyregion/23buses.html?scp=5&amp;sq=double+decker+bus&amp;st=nyt "Step to the Rear of the Bus, Please, or Take a Seat Upstairs"], ''The New York Times'', Tuesday, May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, local bus service along Fifth Avenue is provided by the MTA's [[Fifth and Madison Avenues Line|M1, M2, M3, and M4 buses]].

===Upper Fifth Avenue/Millionaire's Row===
In the late 19th century, the very rich of New York began building mansions along the stretch of Fifth Avenue between [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] and [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]], looking onto [[Central Park]]. By the early 20th century, this portion of Fifth Avenue had been nicknamed "[[Millionaire's Mile|Millionaire's Row]]", with mansions such as the [[Mrs. William B. Astor House]] and [[William A. Clark House]]. Entries to Central Park along this stretch include Inventor's Gate at 72nd Street, which gave access to the park's carriage drives, and Engineers' Gate at 90th Street, used by equestrians.

A milestone change for Fifth Avenue came in 1916, when the grand corner mansion at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue that [[James A. Burden II]] had erected in 1893 became the first private mansion on Fifth Avenue above 59th Street to be demolished to make way for a grand apartment house. The building at [[907 Fifth Avenue]] began a trend, with its 12 stories around a central court, with two apartments to a floor.&lt;ref&gt;The smallest apartment was a half-floor, of 12 rooms; [http://www.thecityreview.com/ues/fifave/fif907.htm 907 Fifth Avenue].&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong cornice above the fourth floor, just at the eaves height of its neighbors, was intended to soften its presence.

In January 1922, the city reacted to complaints about the ongoing replacement of Fifth Avenue's mansions by apartment buildings by restricting the height of future structures to {{convert|75|ft|m}}, about half the height of a ten-story apartment building.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;J. E. R. Carpenter, The Architect Who Shaped Upper Fifth Avenue, New York Times, August 26, 2007, [[Christopher Gray]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/realestate/26scap.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[J. E. R. Carpenter]] brought suit, and won a verdict overturning the height restriction in 1923. Carpenter argued that "the avenue would be greatly improved in appearance when deluxe apartments would replace the old-style mansions."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Led by real estate investors [[Benjamin Winter, Sr.]] and Frederick Brown, the old mansions were quickly torn down and replaced with apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239257 Entrepreneur Magazine: "Built for Business: Midtown Manhattan in the 1920s"]. Retrieved November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

This area contains many notable apartment buildings, including [[810 Fifth Avenue]] and the [[Park Cinq]], many of them built in the 1920s by architects such as [[Rosario Candela]] and [[J. E. R. Carpenter]]. A very few post-[[World War II]] structures break the unified limestone frontage, notably the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] between 88th and 89th Streets.

'''''Fire and Rain''''' is a 1989 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Jerry Jameson|Jerry J. Jameson]], starring [[Charles Haid]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Tom Bosley]], as well as an [[all-star]] ensemble television cast in supporting roles. It is based on the [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]] [[plane crash]] at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] on August 2, 1985, as depicted in ''Fire and Rain: A Tragedy in American Aviation'' (1986) by Jerome Greer Chandler.

Jerry J. Jameson had become known for his work on "movie-of-the-week phenomenon and group-jeopardy suspense and terror", although he also became a specialist in "one-off" television and film features.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2009, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;The film was an example of the aviation "disaster" film, as well, it also very much fits the additional [[genre]] of the complex, heavily character-driven [[ensemble cast]] film, exploring the personal dramas and interactions that develop among the passengers and crew as they deal with a deadly onboard emergency. It, however, veers from the traditional format as it is based on a real-life accident.

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=November 2015}} 
On August 2, 1985, Delta Airlines Flight 191, flown by Captain Connors ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]) and First Officer Rudy Price ([[Dick Christie]]) is preparing to land at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] on its single stop, flying from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] to [[Los Angeles]]. Air Traffic controllers advise that a thunderstorm is present. The flight crew surmise that the plane might get washed, but have no other worries about the storm being so near. Passengers such as Lucille Jacobson ([[Patti Labelle]]), who is terrified of flying, however, are fearful about landing in a storm. Others, like Marilyn (Gloria Hocking) and Mike Steinberg (Joe Berryman) are thinking more about their California vacation. As the rain pelts down on the plane, there is no warning of an impending crisis.

Without warning, the plane is slammed into the ground, a mile short of the runway, slicing into a small car on the road, killing William Mayberry (Rudy Young), before skidding onto the field and exploding. Within a minute, all airport fire and emergency units are alerted.  Five minutes into the rescue, first responders Jack Ayers ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), Beth Mancini ([[Angie Dickinson]]), led by Bob Sonnamaker ([[Charles Haid]]) are rapidly deployed to the scene. The severed rear section of the plane is where most survivors are found although flight attendants at the front also survive.

==Production==
[[File:Screen shot Fire-and Rain.png|thumb|The film's utilized images of Delta's Lockheed L-1011 fleet, which had the same livery throughout the 28-year span of service with the airline.]]
Filmed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the film was a [[docudrama]] that recreated the events of August 2, 1985, when Delta Airlines Flight 191, a [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar]] airliner flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles was coming into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop on the route.  It unexpectedly flew into an isolated thunderstorm hovering very close to the field. The storm created a dangerous "[[wind shear]]", or "[[microburst]]", dashing it into the ground just slightly more than a mile north of the outer perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-05.pdf "Delta Air Lines Flight 191 Crash."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817111801/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-05.pdf |date=2014-08-17 }} ''[[National Transportation Safety Board]]''. Retrieved: December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film incorporated the true-life stories of many of the 152 passengers and 11 crew members on board. In the end, 137 died and 28 survived; one other person on the ground was also killed. The prologue to the film indicated that the crash was one of the worst aircraft mishaps in U.S. history. Up to that time, the circumstances behind it regarding microbursts and wind shears of the kind that brought it down, as well as the kind of thunderstorm that caused them, were unknown. Subsequently, the investigation and review of procedures led to modifications in all big-body civil aircraft whereby their radar could detect the anomalies of major storm systems. At the time, it could only detect the actual presence of the storm itself. A groundbreaking legal action also resulted.&lt;ref name=time&gt;Magnuson, Ed. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050423-2,00.html "Like a Wall of Napalm."] ''Time,'' April 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firefighters and emergency personnel were portrayed by real first responders from the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]]. Some of them had been on duty during the actual rescue following the crash, and were, in effect, portraying themselves.

==Reception==
The crash of Delta Flight 191 was not only the subject of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0097360|Fire and Rain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured on an episode of ''[[When Weather Changed History]]'' on [[The Weather Channel]],&lt;ref&gt;''When Weather Changed History'' episode {{IMDb title|1307432|Delta 191 Crash}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the episode "Deadly Weather" of ''[[Survival in the Sky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Survival in the Sky'' episode {{IMDb title|1383507|Deadly Weather}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The television series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' (aka ''Air Crash Investigation'' or ''Air Emergency'') on [[Discovery Channel Canada]] and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] dramatized it in the episode "Invisible Killer" (aka "Slammed to the Ground").&lt;ref name=mayday&gt;"Slammed To The Ground." ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown and discussed in a later ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' episode about the [[American Airlines Flight 1420]] accident, which also occurred during landing in bad weather conditions.

== Architectural career ==
[[File:207 Bluff Road, Sandringham.jpeg|thumb|207 Bluff Road, Sandringham, Victoria, Australia. Mewton's residence for two decades.]]
Mewton began his architectural career in 1923, working at the [[Blackett, Foster &amp; Craig]] office while studying at night at the Working Men's College (later to be known as the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], RMIT).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Throughout 1926 to 1928 Mewton attended night classes at the [[Melbourne University Architectural Atelier]] (MUAA).&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt; After graduating from MUAA on 27 August 1928 Mewton travelled to London with [[Roy Grounds]] and [[Oscar Bayne]], colleagues at the University Atelier.&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Here Grounds, Mewton and Bayne lived together in rented accommodation in London.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

During his time in London, Mewton worked for [[Adems Holden &amp; Pearson]], the firm is known for the design of the modernist brick and concrete suburban [[London Underground]] railway stations.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

In 1929 after travelling to New York Mewton started working in the [[Van Alen]] office. At the time the firm was in the completion stage of the Chrysler buildings.&lt;ref name=ancestry&gt;[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?new=I&amp;gsfn=Geoffrey+Harley&amp;gsln=Mewton&amp;gl=ROOT-CATEGORY&amp;rank=I&amp;gss+sfs62_&amp;msbdy=1905], www.ancestrylibrary.com, viewed 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

At the age of 25 on 20 October 1930 Mewton returned to London to sit his [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) examinations and took the opportunity to travel throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=ancestry /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

On returning home to Melbourne, Australia on 13 September 1932, Mewton set up his own office.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; A year later Roy Grounds returned to Melbourne and the pair formed the office [[Mewton &amp; Grounds]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Together they were subsequently responsible for the design of several buildings that introduced modernism to Melbourne.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt; Their partnership was informal and each worked individually, collecting their own profits.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Quickly the pair became acknowledged as the protagonists of modernism in Melbourne.

Within this body of work Mewton demonstrates a skill in rectilinear arrangement which also exhibits an interest in the work of Dutch Modernist Architect [[William Dudok]] and Russian architect [[Lakov Chernikov]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; The Watt House Toorak, VIC (1934), Fairbairn House, Toorak VIC (1935–1936) and Mewton's own home 207 Bluff Road (1938) epitomise his interest in living room garden windows. To create a house that opened to the garden Mewton used windows that could be folded back completely.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described Mewton's work as "the perfect example of the Victorian type, house and garden are really planned as one."&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;

In 1939 the partnership between Mewton and Grounds was dissolved. From here Mewton began partnership with [[Edward Billson]]. The pair practised together from 1939 to 1942.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Mewton worked for the [[Department of Labour and National Service]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=madge&gt;Madge, J and Peckham, A (2006).

Mewton worked briefly in 1945 for the firm A.C. Leith &amp; Barttett. He assisted in the design of the Housing Commission of Victoria.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; He was nominated that same year as judge for the Sun Post War Homes competition (1945). He was an advocate and committee member of 'Small Homes Service' [[Royal Victorian Institute of Architects]] (RVIA).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Later in 1945 Mewton joined the firm [[Godfrey &amp; Spowers]]. Also joining the partnership were Eric Hughes and John Lobb. Together they formed '[[Godfrey&amp;Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb]]'.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, R (2005). "A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and their people", www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/42.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding in the late 1950s the firm began to undertake industrial and office buildings such as; Allan’s Music Building, Collins St (1965), National Mutual Centre Melbourne (1965) and Dallas Brooks Hall (1963–1969).&lt;ref name=spowers&gt;[http://www.spowers.com.au/company-profile/spowers-history/, "Spowers Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Mewton continued to work for Godrey&amp;Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb as a partner until he retired in 1980 from practice.&lt;ref name=spowers /&gt;

== Key Works ==

[[File:Woy Woy.jpeg|thumb|Woy Woy, 77 Marine Parade, Elwood, Victoria, Australia. First modernist block of flats in Melbourne. Designed by Mewton&amp;Gounds.]]
*[[Woy Woy]] is the earliest of a small group of multi-storied modernist flats in Elwood, it is also the earliest of its kind in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=peterson /&gt; Built in 1925–1936 the flats were designed by Mewton&amp;Grounds. Woy Woy is located at 77 Marine Parade, Elwood, Victoria, Australia.

*[[207 Bluff Road]], Sandringham, Victoria, Australia, is a single-storeyed clinker brick house. It exhibits terracotta tiles a gabled roof and timber window frames have been painted white. Mewton designed this home for his own residence in 1938. Within the inner city of Melbourne, Australia this house is a rare example of modern architecture during the 1930s in Melbourne. The home has been defined as the modern '[[bush house]]'. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described the house "as a wise house that knows not to be jealous of the garden."&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ColeGealt1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bruce Cole|author2=Adelheid M.

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==
{{Main|Prehistoric art|Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Art of the Middle Paleolithic|List of Stone Age art}}

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

The history of Eastern painting includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

[[File:China qing blue.JPG|thumb|A Chinese painted jar from the [[Han Dynasty|Western Han Era]] (202 BCE – 9 CE)]]
China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

In [[Japonisme]], late 19th-century [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] like [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[tonalism|tonalists]] such as [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], admired early 19th-century Japanese [[Ukiyo-e]] artists like [[Hokusai]] (1760–1849) and [[Hiroshige]] (1797–1858) and were influenced by them.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}
Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

=====Mughal =====
[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640–1650]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

[[Amrita Sher-Gil]] was an Indian painter, sometimes known as India's [[Frida Kahlo]],&lt;ref name="AmritaMaps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/who-is-who/art-culture/amrita-sher-gill.html |title=Amrita Sher-Gill |publisher= mapsofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today considered an important woman painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands at par with that of the Masters of [[Bengal Renaissance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |title=First Lady of the Modern Canvas |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date=17 October 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305222544/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |archivedate=5 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiawomenpainters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |title=Women painters |publisher=21stcenturyindianart.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220174924/http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |archivedate=20 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also the 'most expensive' woman painter of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2007/dec/29art.htm |title=Most expensive Indian artists |publisher=us.rediff.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, she is amongst ''Nine Masters'', whose work was declared as ''art treasures'' by The [[Archaeological Survey of India]], in 1976 and 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |title=Nine Masters |publisher=[[Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204055532/http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 100 of her paintings are now displayed at [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-amrita.asp |title= Showcase: Amrita Sher-Gil |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]
In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[File:Cosmic Synchrony.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Morgan Russell]], ''Cosmic Synchromy'' (1913-14), [[Synchromism]]]]
[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976).

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

====Towards mid-century====
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

====Abstract expressionism====

[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]],'' 1952, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]
Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W. W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-04401-0| pages = 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel, Frackman "Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

===Influence on Western art===
{{see also|Picasso's African Period|Contemporary African art}}
At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise.

These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

'''''In the Shadow of Your Wings''''' (Unter dem Schatten deiner Flügel) is a collection of selected entries from the diary of [[Jochen Klepper]] covering the period between April 1932 and 10 December 1942. The book appeared in 1956.

The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] German [[Author|writer]], [[journalist]] and [[poet]] of ecclesiastical songs, Jochen Klepper, loses his creative power in the course of the above-mentioned ten years under steadily increasing [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] reprisals. Klepper is married with the [[Jew]] Johanna. Hanni, as Johanna is called, has brought two daughters from her first marriage. Klepper's younger stepdaughter Renate is threatened with [[deportation]] after the [[World War II|war]] begins.  Klepper applies for an exit permit for the young girl to go to Sweden. The author appeals to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|security services]]. There his request is turned down. Klepper takes his own life together along the lives of his wife and child in a nondescript Berlin residential house.

'''1932''' Klepper suffers from his childlessness. He calls himself a "[[Religion|religious]] [[Socialism|socialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the 30-year-old author is narrow. But Klepper is fulfilled as an [[intellectual]] by big desire for fame.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1933''' To Kleppers understanding is not author who has merely ideas and materials. Author is who can express that quite peculiar "state of the liveliness"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; in his text. Talent would be unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;
The Nazis have now all power monopolized. Klepper is at the [[Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; employed. He is denounced: "Jewish family. [[SPD]] member"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; is the accusation. The active employees will be suspended from service. Still Klepper not despondent. Because he holds fast to his faith, writes in his novel "The Father, Novel of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|the Soldier-King]]" ([[Stuttgart]] 1937) and loves his wife Hanni. Is Klepper "divine tool"?&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He has doubts.
Also  these odious "[[memoir]]s", which Klepper writes down - which value do they have? The writer will remain in the country at any rate. Abroad he sees no working possibility. Indeed, in Berlin the giants [[Ullstein-Verlag|Ullstein]] and [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]] want his cooperation, however, do not pay. Thus Klepper would like to be taken up in the [[:de:Reichsschrifttumskammer|Empire Literature Chamber]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1934''' The plan succeeds, because one of his guarantors is a [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] man. Besides, Klepper calls the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] "ill visionaries",&lt;ref name="Source p. 145"&gt;Source p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; if he entrusts with his worry about the future of Germany the diary.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1935''' Clamour is not possible for Klepper. He lives under the motto "Keep still".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; With such behavior a small private sphere can be saved. The excesses in [[Kurfürstendamm]] are disconcerting. Jewish women receive on the open road slaps in the face.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of all that, Klepper further wants to write, as long as he may still remain in the Empire Literature Chamber. Since writing is a religious process for him. God has called the author and latter answers with a book - a stammered answer.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1936''' German relatives recommend to the couple Klepper repeatedly to send both daughters in the sure foreign country. Klepper said the precaution would be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The author probably knows about his isolation in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 223&lt;/ref&gt; however, he builds on the help of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In '''1937''', on 25 March&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; the author from the Empire Literature Chamber is excluded. The reason is to Kleppers conviction his [[:de:Mischehe (Nationalsozialismus)|mixing marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion is out on an appeal in June suspended, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Imperial War Department]] recommends Kleppers new novel "The Father" as a reading for the [[Wehrmacht]] members.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1938''' However, the Empire Literature Chamber accuses the [[Christian]] Klepper "of slavish posture" which would contradict the "new mind".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; From March Klepper is supervised no more by the Empire Literature Chamber, but by the [[Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]]. Nevertheless, in this precarious situation there is still a courageous journalist, the Klepper his organ as a platform offers: The Protestant theologian [[:de:Hermann Mulert|Prof. Mulert]] encourages the author to write for the "Christian world". Klepper remains careful. If [[Ernst Wiechert]] sits, nevertheless, because of the case [[Martin Niemöller|Niemöller]] in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Klepper and his wife, Hanni register well as Jewish doctors and lawyers in Germany are no longer allowed to practice, how German Jews to sell their assets and emigrate. There should be a [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]] near [[Weimar]]. Every German Jew should carry from [[:de:Namensänderungsverordnung|1st January, 1939]], in addition, the given name [[List of Biblical names#I|Israel]] or [[Sara (given name)|Sara]] and must give him everywhere. Polish Jews in Germany will be imprisoned or expelled. In spite of this news couple Klepper builds a new house in Berlin. In connection with the [[Kristallnacht]] Klepper disturb the arbitrary arrests of Jewish men by the [[Gestapo]]. Klepper's wife Hanni [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Christianity. Klepper is horrified about Hannis [[:de:Kennkarte|identification card]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1939''' Both stepdaughters Kleppers would like to [[Emigration|emigrate]]. Wife Hanni wants to remain. [[Nazism|NS]] [[Ideology|ideologist]] [[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] speaks openly, all Jews should leave the [[German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews must offer before certain valuables - as for example precious metals - to buying places to the sales.&lt;br/&gt;
When the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|war breaks out]], Klepper does a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] note in his diary: He could not Germany the decline wish.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; As from November Jews for leaving their local authorized by the Gestapo need, Klepper expresses the suicide thought. Is [[suicide]] a sin? The older stepdaughter is the departure to England succeed. Because of the younger daughter Renate wants the couple to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1940''' February: A rumour reaches Klepper. Jews would be deported by [[Szczecin]] to [[Lublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; As a wife of an "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" Hanni is protected. However, for daughter Renate it becomes more and more dangerous: Men of the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|Death's Head SS]] ring in the front door and inquire after the young girl. Renate converts - like before her mother - to the Christianity. Klepper receives news from an unfathomable process in the German Reich: [[Racial hygiene|Hindered]] are murdered. All called events weaken taken together the creativity of the sensitive Klepper so much that he manages the next novels ([[Katharina Luther|Katharina von Bora]]) no more. The vitality, however, he wants to keep. And thus he struggles dogged, tenaciously and, in the end, successfully for an entry permit for Renate to Sweden. For all that Klepper means on 26 July surprisingly, Germany will defeat England.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 522, 4th Line up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1941''' From December, 1940 Klepper serves with the armed forces and will dismiss at the beginning of October, 1941 because of "military unworthiness", thus because of his "non-aryan marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's Jews are now in a very hard situation. Renate must carry discriminating [[Yellow badge]] and brings terrifying news with home: Confessed become after [[Łódź|Litzmannstadt]] deports. The suicide thought lies to young Renate far. She hopes for survival. Klepper penetrates up to "[[Minister without Portfolio#Germany|Imperial Minister]] Dr. [[Wilhelm Frick|Frick]]" and obtains a document in which Renate ministerial protection from deportation is assured. This letter may Renates life admittedly only so long protected until the Sicherheitsdienst mercilessly intervenes. News about the deportation of Jews takes no end. Renate sways between depression and hope.
The girl tells the thoughts of suicide, if their departure fail should, not go back. News of massacres, perpetrated on Jews, invade from the east to Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1942''' Hanni rejects the thought of triple suicide. Klepper does not know whether he should condemn the German warfare. After tantalizing back-and-forth Renate from Sweden receives the desired entry permit. Frick is no more responsible, in the meantime, for the exit permit, but now [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]]. Klepper does not receive the permission and goes voluntarily to the death.

== Title ==
Kleppers faith in God seems steadfast. An external sign of this deep religiousness are the omnipresent [[Bible#Old Testament|Bible]] citations. Under one of the verses stands the book:
:Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
:for my soul takes refuge in you.
:Yes, '''in the shadow of your wings''', I will take refuge,
:until disaster has passed. [[s:Bible (World English)/Psalms#Psalm 57|Psalm 57,1]]&lt;ref&gt;Source pp. 3, 208, 364, 530&lt;/ref&gt;
All citations reflect taken together upon the ten-year-period away the unprecedented God's trust and last imploring, yes, last of all shouting God in the highest need.

== Persons ==

Klepper reports about narrower contacts with writers: [[:de:Reinhold Schneider|Reinhold Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Rudolf Alexander Schröder|Rudolf Alexander Schröder]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; are called multiple. Klepper mentions several prominent concentration camp prisoners - activists of the [[Confessing Church|Bekennenden Kirche]] - thus, e.g., the [[pastor]] [[:de:Hans Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg-Bochum]].

== Style and themes ==

The extensive memoirs can be read as a dialog with God. Klepper lays his welfare and woe in the hands of the Lord. However, besides, Klepper knows that he "one day", as [[Werner Bergengruen|Bergengruen]]&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 262, 14th Bottom line&lt;/ref&gt; formulates a little disrespectfully, before "his heavenly commander" will have to be responsible for his acting and letting. The form arises from the said. Klepper, deeply religious, has torn to and fro. He knows, he does mistakes, but he cannot from his skin. Among the wings of the Lord standing, the fate of the author's resume. And Klepper meticulously describes the process. The honesty and independence of the author is impressive with all. Before the surprised reader enters less the fighter Klepper than rather the silent sufferer.

== Reception ==
*Bergengruen&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 259 - 268&lt;/ref&gt; does in January, 1957 in his detailed review to the first publication of the diaries no secret from his quite obviously deeply to seated resentments.
**It looks as subordinate Bergengruen of sister Hildegard  of the author material motives in the publication of the diaries of brother.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen speaks a truth. Renate's life was as of a "[[Nuremberg Laws|full Jew]]" - as one said in the [[:de:Sprache des Nationalsozialismus|NS linguistic usage]] - threatens in the German Reich. Klepper has had long enough time to support the emigration of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Bergengruen can conclude in the connection from the memoirs neither on feelings of guilt nor on selfdoubt of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 266 bottom - 267 top&lt;/ref&gt;
**To an opponent of the Nazi regime the subservien Klepper could not explain itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;
**Indeed, Bergengruen certifies mental power to the author, however, it lacks him of feeling and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen also calls details which are not discoverable in the available book: For example, when he Klepper after October 1941, in his Berlin home visits, the blended man of the house has glorified his period of service with the armed forces and has regretted his forcible elimination from the troop.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 264, 267&lt;/ref&gt;
*Klepper should have taken away his diaries from the access of the NS henchmen successfully, while he buried the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Riegel, van Rinsum p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|300px|This page (folio 292r) of the [[Book of Kells]] contains the lavishly decorated text that opens the [[Gospel of John]].]]
[[File:DurhamCassiodorusDavidVictor.JPG|thumb|[[David]] from the [[Durham Cassiodorus]], early 8th century, ?Jarrow&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 29, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Insular art''', also known as '''Hiberno-Saxon art''', is the style of art produced in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman history]] of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The term derives from ''insula'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for "island"; in this period Britain and Ireland shared a largely common style different from that of the rest of Europe. Art historians usually group insular art as part of the [[Migration Period art]] movement as well as Early Medieval Western art, and it is the combination of these two traditions that gives the style its special character.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 244–247; Pächt, 65–66; Walies &amp; Zoll, 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Insular art originates from the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monastic]] movement of [[Celtic Christianity]], or metalwork for the secular elite, and the period begins around 600 with the combining of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] styles. One major distinctive feature is [[interlace (art)|interlace]] decoration, in particular the [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] decoration as found at [[Sutton Hoo]], in [[East Anglia]], which is now applied to decorating new types of objects mostly copied from the Mediterranean world, above all the [[codex]] or book.&lt;ref&gt;No manuscripts are commonly dated before 600, but some jewellery, mostly Irish, is dated to the 6th century. Youngs 20–22. The early history of Anglo-Saxon metalwork is dominated by the early-7th-century finds at [[Sutton Hoo]], but it is clear these were the product of a well-established tradition of which only smaller pieces survive. Wilson, 16–27. The earliest Pictish stones may date from the fifth century however. Laing, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finest period of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] which began in the late 8th century.  These are presumed to have interrupted work on the [[Book of Kells]], and no later Gospel books are as heavily or finely illuminated as the masterpieces of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 85, 90; Wilson, 141&lt;/ref&gt; In England the style merged into [[Anglo-Saxon art]] around 900, whilst in Ireland the style continued until the 12th century, when it merged into [[Romanesque art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, [[Scotland]] and the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] in northern England are the most important centres, but examples were found also in southern England, Wales&lt;ref&gt;The late [[Ricemarch Psalter]] is certainly Welsh in origin, and the much earlier [[Hereford Gospels]] is believed by many to be Welsh (see Grove Art Online, S2); the 10th-century [[Book of Deer]], the earliest manuscript with [[Scottish Gaelic]], is an Insular product of eastern Scotland (Grove).&lt;/ref&gt; and in Continental Europe, especially [[Gaul]] (modern France), in centres founded by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] and Anglo-Saxon missions. The influence of insular art affected all subsequent European medieval art, especially in the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving examples of Insular art are mainly [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalwork and carvings in stone, especially [[High cross|stone crosses]].  Surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession.  The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], [[Book of Durrow]], brooches such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and the [[Ruthwell Cross]]. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common.

==Use of the term==
The term was derived from its use for [[Insular script]], first cited by the ''[[OED]]'' in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Insular" 4 b., though as it seems clear from their 1908 quotation that the use of the term was already established; [[Carola Hicks]] dates the first use to 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used for the group of [[Insular Celtic languages]] by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently a more recent usage from the ?1970s on, in works such as {{cite book| last=Cowgill |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Cowgill |year=1975 |chapter=The origins of the Insular Celtic conjunct and absolute verbal endings |editor=H. Rix (ed.) |title=Flexion und Wortbildung: Akten der V. Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft, Regensburg, 9.–14. September 1973 |location=Wiesbaden |pages=40–70 |publisher=Reichert |isbn=978-3-920153-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used mainly to describe the style of decoration of illuminated manuscripts, which are certainly the most numerous type of major surviving objects using the style, it is now used more widely across all the arts.  It has the advantage of recognising the unity of styles across the Britain and Ireland, while avoiding the use of the term ''[[British Isles]]'', a sensitive topic in Ireland, and also circumventing arguments about the origins of the style, and the place of creation of specific works, which were often fierce in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 225–241, Nordenfalk, 11–14, Wailes &amp; Zoll, 25–38, Wilson, 32–36, give accounts of some of these scholarly controversies; [[Oxford Art Online]] "Insular art", [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art The Oxford Dictionary of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905081448/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art |date=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources distinguish between a "wider period between the 5th and 11th centuries, from the departure of the Romans to the beginnings of the Romanesque style" and a "more specific phase from the 6th to 9th centuries, between the conversion to Christianity and the Viking settlements".&lt;ref&gt;Hicks&lt;/ref&gt; C. R. Dodwell, on the other hand, says that in Ireland "the Insular style continued almost unchallenged until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of 1170]]; indeed examples of it occur even as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular decoration==
[[File:KellsDecoratedInitial.jpg|thumb|right|One of hundreds of small initials from the ''Book of Kells'']]
The Insular style is most famous for its highly dense, intricate and imaginative decoration, which takes elements from several earlier styles.  Late [[Iron Age]] Celtic art or "Ultimate [[La Tène style|La Tène]]", gave the love of spirals, [[triskele]]s, circles and other geometric motifs. These were combined with animal forms probably mainly deriving from the Germanic version of the general [[Eurasia]]n [[animal style]], though also from Celtic art, where heads terminating scrolls were common. [[Interlace (visual arts)|Interlace]] was used by both these traditions, as well as Roman art (for example in floor [[mosaic]]s) and other possible influences such as [[Coptic art]], and its use was taken to new levels in insular art, where it was combined with the other elements already mentioned.  There is no attempt to represent depth in manuscript painting, with all the emphasis on a brilliantly patterned surface.  In early works the human figure was shown in the same geometric fashion as animal figures, but reflections of a classical figure style spread as the period went on, probably mostly from the southern Anglo-Saxon regions, though northern areas also had direct contacts with the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Wilson, 38–40, Nordenfalk, 13–26, Calkins Chapter 1, Laing 346–351&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the overall format of the carpet page have often been related to Roman floor mosaics,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 97–100&lt;/ref&gt; Coptic carpets and manuscript paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 19–22, Schapiro, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; without general agreement being reached among scholars.

==Background==
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|Early Anglo-Saxon shoulder-clasps from [[Sutton Hoo]], early 7th century. Gold, garnet, and [[millefiori]] glass.]]
Unlike contemporary [[Byzantine art]], and that of most major periods, insular art does not come from a society where common stylistic influences were spread across a great number of types of object in art, [[applied art]] and [[decorative art]].  Across all the islands society was effectively entirely rural, buildings were rudimentary, and architecture has no Insular style.  Although related objects in many more perishable media certainly existed and have not survived, it is clear that both religious and secular Insular patrons expected individual objects of dazzling virtuousity, that were all the more dazzling because of the lack of visual sophistication in the world in which they were seen.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 48–55, Dodwell, 19 and throughout Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in Ireland, the clerical and secular elites were often very closely linked; some Irish [[Abbot|abbacies]] were held for generations among a small kin-group.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland was divided into very small "kingdoms", almost too many for historians to keep track of, whilst in Britain there was a smaller number of generally larger kingdoms. Both the Celtic (Irish and [[Pict]]ish) and Anglo-Saxon elites had long traditions of metalwork of the finest quality, much of it used for the personal adornment of both sexes of the elite. The Insular style arises from the meeting of their two styles, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon [[animal style]], in a Christian context, and with some awareness of Late Antique style. This was especially so in their application to the book, which was a new type of object for both traditions, as well as to metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 72; Nordenfalk, 7–11, Pächt, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the formation of the new style appears to have been pivotal.  The northernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom continued to expand into areas with Celtic populations, but often leaving those populations largely intact in areas such as [[Dál Riata]], [[Elmet]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. The Irish monastery at [[Iona]] was established by Saint [[Columba]] (Colum Cille) in 563, when Iona was part of a Dál Riata that included territory in both Ireland and modern Scotland. Although the first conversion of a Northumbrian king, that of [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] in 627, was effected by clergy from the [[Gregorian Mission]] to Kent, it was the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Iona that was initially more influential in Northumbria, founding [[Lindisfarne]] on the eastern coast as a satellite in 635.  However Northumbria remained in direct contact with Rome and other important monastic centres were founded by [[Wilfrid]] and [[Benedict Biscop]] who looked to Rome, and at the [[Synod of Whitby]] it was the Roman practices that were upheld, while the Iona contingent walked out, not adopting the Roman Easter dating until 715.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 8–9; Schapiro, 167–173&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so that, at least from the Anglo-Saxons, we have a larger number of pre-Christian survivals than those from later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 4&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of examples that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 134–140 catalogues two examples from Italy and one from Norway. See also Laing, who describes major pieces by period and area at various points.&lt;/ref&gt; In general it is clear that most survivals are only by chance, and that we have only fragments of some types of object—in particular the largest and least portable. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, or tableware or altarware in what were apparently very similar styles—some pieces cannot be confidently assigned between altar and royal dining-table.  It seems possible, even likely, that the finest church pieces were made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 125&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that Irish metalworkers produced most of the best pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 53&lt;/ref&gt; however the finds from the royal burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the far east of England and at the beginning of the period, are as fine in design and workmanship as any Irish pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 16–25&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ardagh Chalice]], c.? 750]]

There are a number of large brooches, including several of comparable quality to the [[Tara brooch]].  Almost all of these are in the [[National Museum of Ireland]], the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], or local museums in the islands.  Each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied in technique and superb in quality.  Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts.  Almost all of the many techniques known in metalwork can be found in Insular work.  Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s.  Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 72–115, and 170–174 on techniques; Ryan, Michael in [[Oxford Art Online]], S2, Wilson, 113–114, 120–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice|Derrynaflan]] Hoard of chalice, [[paten]] with stand, strainer, and basin (only discovered in 1980) are the most outstanding pieces of church metalware to survive (only three other chalices, and no other paten, survive).  These pieces are thought to come from the 8th or 9th century, but most dating of metalwork is uncertain, and comes largely from comparison with manuscripts.  Only fragments remain from what were probably large pieces of church furniture, probably with metalwork on wooden frameworks, such as shrines, crosses and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 125–130, and catalogue entries following, including the Derrynaflan Hoard.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Cong]] is a 12th-century Irish processional cross and [[reliquary]] that shows insular decoration, possibly added in a deliberately revivalist spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, 562&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gilt-bronze]] "[[Athlone]] Crucifixion Plaque" ([[National Museum of Ireland]], perhaps 8th century) is much the best known of a group of nine recorded Irish metal plaques with ''Crucifixions'', and is comparable in style to figures on many high crosses; it may well have come from a book cover.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ruth. ''Irish Crucifixion Plaques: Viking Age or Romanesque?'', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol. 128, (1998), pp. 95–106. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25549845 JSTOR]. [http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123122/http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg |date=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fittings of a major abbey church in the insular period remain hard to imagine; one thing that does seem clear is that the most fully decorated manuscripts were treated as decorative objects for display rather than as books for study.  The most fully decorated of all, the Book of Kells, has several mistakes left uncorrected, the text headings necessary to make the Canon tables usable have not been added, and when it was stolen in 1006 for its cover in precious metals, it was taken from the [[sacristy]], not the library.  The book was recovered, but not the cover, as also happened with the Book of Lindisfarne.  None of the major insular manuscripts have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but we know from documentary evidence that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins 57–60. The 8th-century pocket gospel book [[Book of Dimma]] has a fine 12th-century cover.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-used metal back cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now in the [[Morgan Library]], New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|title=Gospel Book|author=|date=13 July 2017|website=themorgan.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709172139/http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|archivedate=9 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was made in southern Germany in the late 8th or early 9th? century, under heavy insular influence, and is perhaps the best indication as to the appearance of the original covers of the great insular manuscripts, although one gold and garnet piece from the Anglo-Saxon [[Staffordshire Hoard]], found in 2009, may be the corner of a book-cover.  The Lindau design is dominated by a cross, but the whole surface of the cover is decorated, with interlace panels between the arms of the cross.  The [[cloisonné]] enamel shows Italian influence, and is not found in work from the Insular homelands, but the overall effect is very like a carpet page.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 8–9, and plate 2; [http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 Lindau Gospels cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042530/http://themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 |date=13 June 2010 }}, from Morgan Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular manuscripts==
[[File:CathachOfStColumba.jpg|thumb|upright|Cathach of St. Columba, 7th century]]
{{main|Insular illumination}}
Although many more examples survive than of large pieces of metalwork, the development of the style is usually described in terms of the same outstanding examples:

'''[[Cathach of St. Columba]]'''.
An Irish Latin [[psalter]] of the early 7th century,&lt;ref&gt;Or "the second half of the sixth century" according to Schapiro, 229. Calkins, 31–32 gives no date, Nordenfalk, 12–13 says 7th century.&lt;/ref&gt; this is perhaps the oldest known Irish manuscript of any sort.  It contains only decorated letters, at the beginning of each Psalm, but these already show distinctive traits.  Not just the initial, but the first few letters are decorated, at diminishing sizes.  The decoration influences the shape of the letters, and various decorative forms are mixed in a very unclassical way. Lines are already inclined to spiral and metamorphose, as in the example shown. Apart from black, some orange ink is used for dotted decoration.  The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text.  The insular tendency for the decoration to lunge into the text, and take over more and more of it, was a radical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 63–64, in his chapter on the initial, which gives a thorough treatment of the subject. Nordenfalk, 12–13 has other images.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bobbio Jerome]] which according to an inscription dates to before 622, from [[Bobbio Abbey]], an Irish mission centre in northern Italy, has a more elaborate initial with colouring, showing Insular characteristics still more developed, even in such an outpost. From the same [[scriptorium]] and of similar date, the [[Bobbio Orosius]] has the earliest [[carpet page]], although a relatively simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 227–229; Wilson, 60&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The beginning of the Gospel of Mark from the Book of Durrow.]]

'''[[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Durham Gospel Book Fragment]]'''.
The earliest painted Insular manuscript to survive, produced in [[Lindisfarne]] c. 650, but with only seven leaves of the book remaining, not all with illuminations. This introduces interlace, and also uses Celtic motifs drawn from metalwork. The design of two of the surviving pages relates them as a two-page spread&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 32–33; Nordenfalk, 14–15, 28, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Durrow]]'''.
The earliest surviving Gospel Book with a full programme of decoration (though not all has survived): six extant carpet pages, a full-page miniature of the four evangelist's symbols, four full-page miniatures of the evangelists' symbols, four pages with very large initials, and decorated text on other pages.  Many minor initial groups are decorated.  Its date and place of origin remain subjects of debate, with 650–690 and [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]] in Ireland, [[Iona]] or [[Lindisfarne]] being the normal contenders.  The influences on the decoration are also highly controversial, especially regarding [[Copt]]ic or other Near Eastern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47, and 19–22 on Coptic influences; see also Schapiro Index (under Dublin), Wilson, 32–36 and index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After large initials the following letters on the same line, or for some lines beyond, continue to be decorated at a smaller size.  Dots round the outside of large initials are much used.  The figures are highly stylised, and some pages use Germanic interlaced animal ornament, whilst others use the full repertoire of Celtic geometric spirals. Each page uses a different and coherent set of decorative motifs. Only four colours are used, but the viewer is hardly conscious of any limitation from this.  All the elements of Insular manuscript style are already in place. The execution, though of high quality, is not as refined as in the best later books, nor is the scale of detail as small.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 002.jpg|thumb|right|Carpet page from the Lindisfarne Gospels]]
'''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]]'''
Produced in Lindisfarne by [[Eadfrith]], [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], between about 690 and his death in 721 (perhaps towards the end of this period), this is a Gospel Book in the style of the Book of Durrow, but more elaborate and complex.  All the letters on the pages beginning the Gospels are highly decorated in a single composition, and many two-page openings are designed as a unit, with carpet pages facing an ''incipit'' ("Here begins..") initial page at the start of each Gospel.  Eadfrith was almost certainly the scribe as well as the artist.  There are four [[Evangelist portrait]]s, clearly derived from the classical tradition but treated without any sense of depth; the borders around them are far plainer than the decoration of the text pages, and there is clearly a sense of two styles which Eadfrith does not attempt to integrate wholly.  The carpet-pages are enormously complex, and superbly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 63–78; Nordenfalk, 60–75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Lichfield Gospels]]'''
Likely made in Lichfield around 730, this deluxe gospel-book contains eight major decorated pages, including a stunning cross-carpet page and portraits of the evangelists Mark and Luke. The gospels of Matthew and Mark and the beginning of Luke survives. From its time in Wales, pages include marginalia representing some of the earliest examples of Old Welsh writing. The manuscript has been at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] since the late 10th century, except for a brief period during the English Civil War. 

'''[[St Petersburg Bede]]'''.
Attributed to [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] in Northumbria between about 730–746, this contains larger opening letters in which metalwork styles of decoration can clearly be seen. There are thin bands of interlace within the members of letters. It also contains the earliest [[historiated initial]], a bust probably of [[Pope Gregory I]], which like some other elements of the decoration, clearly derives from a Mediterranean model.  Colour is used, although in a relatively restrained way.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 199–224; Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Kells]]'''
Usually dated to around 800, although sometimes up to a century earlier, the place of origin is disputed between Iona and [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], or other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 84&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often thought to have been begun in Iona and then continued in Ireland, after disruption from [[Viking]] raids; the book survives nearly intact but the decoration is not finished, with some parts in outline only.  It is far more comprehensively decorated than any previous manuscript in any tradition, with every page (except two) having many small decorated letters.  Although there is only one carpet page, the ''incipit'' initials are so densely decorated, with only a few letters on the page, that they rather take over this function.  Human figures are more numerous than before, though treated in a thoroughly stylised fashion, and closely surrounded, even hemmed in, by decoration as crowded as on the initial pages.  A few scenes such as the ''Temptation'' and ''Arrest of Christ'' are included, as well as a Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels (the earliest Madonna in a Western book).  More miniatures may have been planned or executed and lost.  Colours are very bright and the decoration has tremendous energy, with spiral forms predominating.  Gold and silver are not used.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 78–92; Nordenfalk, 108–125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other books===
[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|St John from the Book of Mulling]]
A distinctive Insular type of book is the '''pocket gospel book''', inevitably much less decorated, but in several cases with Evangelist portraits and other decoration.  Examples include the [[Book of Mulling]], [[Book of Deer]], [[Book of Dimma]], and the smallest of all, the [[Stonyhurst Gospel]] (now [[British Library]]), a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon text of the Gospel of John, which belonged to [[St Cuthbert]] and was buried with him.  Its beautifully tooled goatskin cover is the oldest Western bookbinding to survive, and a virtually unique example of insular leatherwork, in an excellent state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham &amp; Rose, and [http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125092823/http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg |date=25 November 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Anglo-Saxon and Irish manuscripts have a distinctive rougher finish to their vellum, compared to the smooth-polished surface of contemporary continental and all late-medieval vellum.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 32&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that, in contrast to later periods, the scribes copying the text were often also the artists of the illuminations, and might include the most senior figures of their monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 9 and 72. The tradition that St [[Cuthbert]] copied the Stonyhurst Gospel himself may be correct, though that attributing the Book of Kells to St [[Columba]] himself seems impossible.  For other high-ranking Anglo-Saxon monastic artists see [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]], [[Spearhafoc]] and [[Dunstan]], all bishops.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to Anglo-Saxon art===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
In England the pull of a Continental style operated from very early on; the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome had brought the [[St Augustine Gospels]] and other manuscripts now lost with them, and other books were imported from the continent early on.  The 8th-century [[Bede, Ecclesiastical History (British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius C. II)|Cotton Bede]] shows mixed elements in the decoration, as does the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] of similar period, probably written in [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Vespasian Psalter]] it is clear which element is coming to dominate.  All these and other members of the "Tiberius" group of manuscripts were written south of the river [[Humber]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Codex Amiatinus]], of before 716 from Jarrow, is written in a fine [[uncial]] script, and its only illustration is conceived in an Italianate style, with no insular decoration; it has been suggested this was only because the volume was made for presentation to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The dating is partly known from the grant of additional land secured to raise the generations of cattle, amounting to 2,000 head in all, which were necessary to make the [[vellum]] for three complete but unillustrated Bibles, which shows the resources necessary to make the large books of the period.

Many Anglo-Saxon manuscripts written in the south, and later the north, of England show strong Insular influences until the 10th century or beyond, but the pre-dominant stylistic impulse comes from the continent of Europe; carpet-pages are not found, but many large figurative miniatures are. Panels of interlace and other Insular motifs continue to be used as one element in borders and frames ultimately classical in derivation.  Many continental manuscripts, especially in areas influenced by the Celtic missions, also show such features well into the early Romanesque period.  "Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1998), 74(quote)–75, and see index.; Pächt, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of Insular art===
[[File:Meister der Franko-Sächsischen Gruppe 001.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] Franco-Saxon ''Incipit'' initial combines Insular decoration with classicising [[Evangelist portrait]]s.]]

The true legacy of insular art lies not so much in the specific stylistic features discussed above, but in its fundamental departure from the classical approach to decoration, whether of books or other works of art.  The barely controllable energy of Insular decoration, spiralling across formal partitions, becomes a feature of later medieval art, especially Gothic art, in areas where specific Insular motifs are hardly used, such as architecture. The mixing of the figurative with the ornamental also remained characteristic of all later medieval illumination; indeed for the complexity and density of the mixture, Insular manuscripts are only rivalled by some 15th-century works of late Flemish illumination. It is also noticeable that these characteristics are always rather more pronounced in the north of Europe than the south; Italian art, even in the Gothic period, always retains a certain classical clarity in form.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71; A major theme of Pächt, see in particular chapter II and pp. 173–177&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmistakable Insular influence can be seen in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts, even though these were also trying to copy the Imperial styles of Rome and Byzantium. Greatly enlarged initials, sometimes inhabited, were retained, as well as far more abstract decoration than found in classical models. These features continue in [[Ottonian]] and contemporary French illumination and metalwork, before the Romanesque period further removed classical restraints, especially in manuscripts, and the capitals of columns.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 72–73, and Henderson 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muiredach s Cross.jpg|thumb|right|Muiredach's High Cross, Monasterboice]]

==Sculpture==
{{main|High cross}}
Large stone [[high cross]]es, usually erected outside monasteries or churches, first appear in the 8th century in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grove Art Online]] S4&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at [[Carndonagh]], [[Donegal]], a monastic site with [[Iona|Ionian]] foundations,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Herity, ''Studies in the layout, buildings and art in stone of early Irish monasteries'', Pindar Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; apparently later than the earliest [[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es, which may be 7th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 54–56, 113–129&lt;/ref&gt; Later insular carvings found throughout Britain and Ireland were almost entirely geometrical, as was the decoration on the earliest crosses.  By the 9th century figures are carved, and the largest crosses have very many figures in scenes on all surfaces, often from the [[Old Testament]] on the east side, and the New on the west, with a [[Crucifixion]] at the centre of the cross.  The 10th-century [[Muiredach's High Cross]] at [[Monasterboice]] is usually regarded as the peak of the Irish crosses.  In later examples the figures become fewer and larger, and their style begins to merge with the Romanesque, as at the Dysert Cross in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th-century [[Northumbria]]n [[Ruthwell Cross]] (now in [[Scotland]]), unfortunately damaged by [[Presbyterian]] [[iconoclasm]], is the most impressive remaining [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] cross, though as with most Anglo-Saxon crosses the original cross head is missing.  Many Anglo-Saxon crosses were much smaller and more slender than the Irish ones, and therefore only had room for carved foliage, but the [[Bewcastle Cross]], [[Easby Cross]] and [[Sandbach Crosses]] are other survivals with considerable areas of figurative [[relief]]s, with larger-scale figures than any early Irish examples.  Even early Anglo-Saxon examples mix vine-scroll decoration of Continental origin with interlace panels, and in later ones the former type becomes the norm, just as in manuscripts.  There is literary evidence for considerable numbers of carved stone crosses across the whole of England, and also straight shafts, often as grave-markers, but most survivals are in the northernmost counties.  There are remains of other works of [[monumental sculpture]] in Anglo-Saxon art, even from the earlier periods, but nothing comparable from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson deals extensively with the sculptural remains, 74–84 for the 8th century, 105–108, 141–152, 195–210 for later periods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictish standing stones==
{{main|Pictish stones}}
[[File:HiltonofCadboll01.JPG|thumb|upright|A replica of the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]], carved in the Pictish [[Easter Ross]] style 800–900 AD]]

The stone monuments erected by the [[Picts]] of [[Scotland]] north of the Clyde-Forth line between the 6th–8th centuries are particularly striking in design and construction, carved in the typical [[Easter Ross]] style related to that of insular art, though with much less classical influence. In particular the forms of animals are often closely comparable to those found in Insular manuscripts, where they typically represent the Evangelist's symbols, which may indicate a Pictish origin for these forms, or another common source.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 54–55, Henderson, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings come from both pagan and early Christian periods, and the Pictish symbols, which are still poorly understood, do not seem to have been repugnant to Christians.  The purpose and meaning of the stones are only partially understood, although some think that they served as personal memorials, the symbols indicating membership of [[clan]]s, lineages, or kindreds and depict ancient ceremonies and rituals&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 53–56. See also [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 C. Michael Hogan, ''Eassie Stone'', The Megalithic Portal, editor: Andy Burnham, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085342/http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Eassie Stone]] and the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]]. It is possible that they had subsidiary uses, such as marking tribal or lineage territories.  It has also been suggested that the [[symbol]]s could have been some kind of [[pictograph]]ic system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are also a few examples of similar decoration on Pictish silver jewellery, notably the Norrie's Law Hoard, of the 7th century or perhaps earlier, much of which was melted down on discovery,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8th-century [[St Ninian's Isle]] Hoard, with many brooches and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 117–118; Youngs, 108–112, see also [http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30= Shetland museum images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727053200/http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30%3D |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving items from both are now held by [[National Museums Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/s/pictish+silver|title=Search Results|first=Ian Brooks; Sven Edge; Xabier Garcia; Jamie Wheeler; Andy|last=Main|date=|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volumes==

===One: Hache===
Published in 2008

After years of incessant fighting, the war between humanity and the High Beasts is brought to an end after the humans begin using [[firearms]], forcing the comparatively primitive High Beasts to declare a truce. It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a [[blasphemy]]. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only [[virgin]]s can come out alive.
[[Image:Les Betes Haute.jpg|thumb|The High-Beasts advance against human forces]]
Years later, the war between the two races has reached a [[stalemate]], with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him. Hugo crosses a cursed swamp filled inhabited by tree spirits, and finds Clam in a Church, taking a sacrament. The two depart to the Wood of Virgins.

'''''Louie''''' is an American [[comedy-drama]] [[television program|television series]] that premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] on June 29, 2010. It is written, directed, created, edited, and produced by [[comedian]] [[Louis C.K.]],&lt;ref name="hitfix_interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-louie-creator-star-louis-ck-on-season-one-drunken-sarah-palin-tweets-and-more |title=Interview: 'Louie' creator/star Louis CK on season 1, drunken Sarah Palin tweets and more |date=January 24, 2011 |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |publisher=HitFix.com |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also stars in the show as a fictionalized version of himself, a comedian and newly divorced father raising his two daughters in [[New York City]]. The show has a loose format atypical for television comedy series, consisting of largely unconnected storylines and segments (described by FX president [[John Landgraf]] as "extended [[Sketch comedy|vignettes]]")&lt;ref name="Variety0819"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |title=More laffs in FX lineup |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 2009 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007486?refCatId=1236 |accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that revolve around Louie's life, punctuated by live stand-up performances.

==Synopsis==
''Louie'' is loosely based on comedian [[Louis C.K.]]'s life, showing segments of him doing his [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routine onstage, and depicting his life offstage as a divorced father of two girls. Each episode features either two stories (which may or may not connect thematically) or a longer full-episode story (often consisting of numerous connected shorter pieces). The stories of all episodes revolve around Louie.

The pieces are interspersed with short clips of Louie's stand-up, usually performed in [[New York (state)|New York]] comedy clubs, mainly the [[Comedy Cellar]] and [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] in [[Manhattan]]. The stand-up in the show consists of original material recorded for the series, and is usually shot from the stage rather than from the more traditional audience perspective. Sometimes these comedy segments are integrated into the stories themselves, whereas other times they simply serve to bookend them with a loosely connected topic. In the [[Louie (season 1)|first season]], blunt, socially awkward conversations between Louie and his therapist are also shown occasionally. Beginning in the [[Louie (season 3)|third season]], some episodes do not feature any stand-up performances or the opening credit sequence.

Episodes in the series have standalone plots, although some recurring roles (e.g. Louie's playdate friend Pamela, portrayed by [[Pamela Adlon]], who was C.K.'s co-star in ''[[Lucky Louie]]'') occasionally provide [[story arc]] continuity between episodes. Continuity is not enforced; for example, Louie's mother has been portrayed in two very different ways.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;In the first season's seventh episode, "Double Date/Mom", Louie's mother is played by [[Mary Louise Wilson]] and is portrayed as a very spiteful woman. By contrast, in that season's eleventh episode, "God", a flashback to Louie's childhood shows the young Louie's mother as a very different woman with a kind-hearted personality, and she is played by [[Amy Landecker]]. Landecker also portrayed present-day Louie's date earlier in the season, in episode 9, "Bully".&lt;/ref&gt; As C.K. explained, "Every episode has its own goal, and if it messes up the goal of another episode, [...] I just don't care."&lt;ref name="jkl_2011-06-27"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Monday, June 27, 2011 |url=http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/episode-detail/louis-ck-ashley-hebert-missy-peregrym-steel-magnolia/805384 |series=Jimmy Kimmel Live! |serieslink=Jimmy Kimmel Live! |credits=Presenter: [[Jimmy Kimmel]] |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |airdate=June 27, 2011}} Louis C.K. segment on YouTube: {{YouTube|_oF8Js9v3ag|Part 1}}, {{YouTube|zb21mN7_0bM|Part 2}}, {{YouTube|adRTR-ifCbw|Part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories also take place outside of the show's main time frame. For two examples, the episode "God" depicts Louie's childhood, and the episode "Oh Louie" shows the comedian 9 years earlier in his career. Beginning in the third season, ''Louie'' has moved toward story continuity within the season, and it includes multi-episode story arcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-fxs-louie-still-unpredictable-and-brilliant-in-season-3 |title=Review: FX's 'Louie' still unpredictable, and brilliant, in season 3 |publisher=HitFix |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pilot (Louie)|pilot episode]] includes segments depicting a school field trip and an embarrassing first date, with subsequent episodes covering a diverse range of material, including [[divorce]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[Catholic guilt]].

==Cast and characters==
[[File:Louis CK 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Series creator Louis C.K. plays the lead role and also writes and directs each episode.]]
C.K. serves as the show's lead and plays the only character who appears in every episode. ''Louie'' lacks a regular fixed cast, and instead features many [[guest appearance]]s by stand-up comedians and actors. As a stand-up comedian in [[New York City]], Louie's social circle on the show consists mainly of other comedians, and many notable comedians (such as [[Nick DiPaolo]], [[Todd Barry]], [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Chris Rock]], and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]) have had recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.

Most episodes tend to focus on Louie's interactions with new characters. However, the show features a number of recurring characters, including Louie's two daughters, Lilly ([[Hadley Delany]]) and Jane ([[Ursula Parker]]); his brother Robbie ([[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]]); his teenage-looking agent Doug (Edward Gelbinovich); Pamela ([[Pamela Adlon]]), his best friend and love interest; Dr. Ben ([[Ricky Gervais]]), Louie's juvenile and arrogant [[General practitioner|doctor]]; Louie's [[Psychiatry|therapist]] ([[David Patrick Kelly]]); and his ex-wife, Janet ([[Susan Kelechi Watson]]).

Since ''Louie'' lacks continuity between episodes, supporting actors occasionally reappear in multiple roles, as is the case with William Stephenson, who appears as a bus driver in the pilot and as himself in "Oh Louie/Tickets"; [[Amy Landecker]], who appears as Louie's date in "Bully" and as a young Louie's mother in "God" and "In the Woods"; and [[F. Murray Abraham]], who plays a swinger in "New Jersey/Airport", Louie's uncle Excelsior in "Dad", and Louie's father in "In the Woods". Furthermore, Louie's mother and sisters have each been portrayed by multiple actresses, although his children have been consistently portrayed by Delany and Parker since the middle of the first season. His ex-wife is portrayed by Brooke Bloom in a flashback scene of "Elevator Part 4".

==Production==
[[File:Comedy Cellar stage, New York NY.jpg|thumb|The stage of the [[Comedy Cellar]], which is often shown on the series.]]
Rather than accepting a bigger-budget production deal with a larger network, C.K. accepted the modest offer of $200,000 (covering his own fee as well as production costs) to do a pilot with [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], since FX allowed him full creative control. The show is shot on a [[The Red One (camera)|Red]] camera setup, and C.K. edits many of the episodes on his personal MacBook Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5658621/how-louis-ck-shoots-and-edits-his-own-show |title=How Louis C.K.

Referring to [[John Landgraf]], who convinced C.K. to accept a deal with FX, C.K. said: 

{{quote|He had a very loose idea of what he wanted. I said, "Let me shoot a pilot and you don't have anything to do with it. I won't even pitch you the idea or show you the script or show you the footage or show you the casting. Just wire me the money and let me do the show." And he was willing to do that. One of the reasons it was done that way was he only gave me $200,000 for the thing all in. Since I was able to prove this was a way to do it and they liked what they got, I was able to keep doing it that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/fx-landed-louis-c-k-with-creative-freedom-and-by-wiring-200000/|title=FX Landed Louis C.K.

Production began in November 2009. C.K. said of his show, "It's very vignette-y. It's very [[cinema verite|vérité]]. All those French words. I use 'em all."&lt;ref name="NYT0820" /&gt; C.K.'s ''Lucky Louie'' co-star [[Pamela Adlon]] serves as consulting producer of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/arts/television/29louie.html|title=Life After Divorce (Don't Ask About the Monkeys)|work=The New York Times|date=June 28, 2010|author=Stanley, Alessandra|authorlink=Alessandra Stanley|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the third season, C.K. announced that he would be handing off some editing duties to longtime [[Woody Allen]] collaborator [[Susan E.

==Critical reception==

''Louie'' has received acclaim from critics.  The stand-up segments received strong praise, as did the show's perceived "indie film" style, with some likening the show to the work of [[Woody Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/arts/television/29louie.html |title=Life After Divorce (Don't Ask About the Monkeys) |date=June 28, 2010 |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms largely centered on the pacing and low-key delivery of the show's jokes, which often include long setups compared to the rapid-fire punchlines of a traditional sitcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-06-29/entertainment/27068435_1_bus-driver-scripted-standup-act |title=FX's 'Louie' better than HBO's 'Lucky Louie', but Louis C.K. still hasn't found his niche |date=June 29, 2010 |last=Hinckley |first=David |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943065?refCatId=32 |title=Louie |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=June 26, 2010 |work=[[Variety.com]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the "top TV" lists tracked by Metacritic, ''Louie'' appeared on 9 of 28 in 2010&lt;ref name="2010toptens"/&gt; and 22 of 39 in 2011, the latter of which includes 3 lists where the show was ranked 1st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dietz|first=Jason|title=2011 Television Critic Top Ten Lists|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-critic-top-10-best-shows-of-2011|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 69 out of 100, based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Louie Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louie (season 2)|second season]] scored 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 7 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-2/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 2 |accessdate=April 16, 2011 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third season received critical acclaim, scoring 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-3/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 3 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth season also received critical acclaim, scoring 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-4/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 4 |accessdate=May 13, 2014 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth season received acclaim as well, scoring 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-5/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television critics [[Alan Sepinwall]] and [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] ranked ''Louie'' as the 18th best American television show of all time in their book titled ''[[TV (The Book)]]'', stating that unlike other sitcoms which kept their tone and format the same throughout their respective runs, the series "morphed from week to week, episode to episode, sometimes minute to minute. In doing so, it translated the thought-processes of stand-up comedy into cinematic terms, and in a way that was new to commercial television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|last2=Seitz|first2=Matt Zoller|title=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|date=September 6, 2016|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-1455588190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo3||物の哀れ|'''Mono no aware'''}}, literally "the pathos of things", and also translated as "an empathy toward things", or "a sensitivity to ephemera", is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for the awareness of {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life.

The term comes from Heian period literature, but was picked up and used by 18th century [[Edo period]] Japanese cultural scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]] in his literary criticism of ''[[The Tale of Genji]],'' and later to other seminal Japanese works including the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. It became central to his philosophy of literature and eventually to [[Culture of Japan|Japanese cultural tradition]].

==Etymology==
The phrase is derived from the Japanese word {{nihongo3||物|mono}}, which means "thing", and {{nihongo3||哀れ|aware}}, which was a [[Heian period]] expression of measured surprise (similar to "ah" or "oh"), translating roughly as "pathos", "poignancy", "deep feeling", "sensitivity", or "awareness".  Thus, ''mono no aware'' has frequently been translated as "the 'ahh-ness' of things", life, and love. Awareness of the transience of all things heightens appreciation of their beauty, and evokes a gentle sadness at their passing. In his criticism of ''The Tale of Genji'' Motoori noted that ''mono no aware'' is the crucial emotion that moves readers. Its scope was not limited to [[Japanese literature]], and became associated with Japanese cultural tradition (see also ''[[sakura]]'').&lt;ref name=khoon&gt;Choy Lee, Khoon. ''Japan: Between Myth and Reality''. 1995, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
Notable [[manga]] artists who use ''mono no aware''–style storytelling include [[Hitoshi Ashinano]], [[Kozue Amano]], and [[Kaoru Mori]]. In [[anime]], both ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' by [[Isao Takahata]] and ''[[Mai Mai Miracle]]'' by [[Sunao Katabuchi]] emphasize the passing of time in gentle notes and by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past.  The Japanese director [[Yasujirō Ozu]] was well known for creating a sense of ''mono no aware'', frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying {{nihongo3|"Fine weather, isn't it?"|いい天気ですね|''"''Ii tenki desu ne''?"''}}, after a familial and societal paradigm shift, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan. Ozu has often expressed feelings by showing the faces of objects rather than the face of an actor. Some examples include two fathers contemplating the rocks in a "dry landscape" garden, and a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just left home after getting married. These images exemplified ''mono no aware'' as powerfully as the expression on the greatest actor's face.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/|title=2.

In his book about courtly life in [[ancient Japan]], ''The World of the Shining Prince'', [[Ivan Morris]] compares ''mono no aware'' to [[Virgil]]'s term ''[[lacrimae rerum]]'', Latin for "tears of things".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Ivan I. ''The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan''. 1994, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] author [[Ken Liu]]'s short story, "Mono no Aware", won the 2013 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906045317/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by works like the science fiction manga ''[[Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō]]'', Liu sought to evoke an "aesthetic primarily oriented towards creating in the reader an empathy towards the inevitable passing of all things", and to acknowledge "the importance of memory and continuity with the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mamatas |first=Nick |title=Q/A With Ken Liu (and the return of Intern Kathleen) |url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |publisher=Haikasoru |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040356/http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]- and [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]]-winning British novelist [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] ends many of his novels without any sense of resolution. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realization brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection of the Japanese idea of ''mono no aware''.

Films like [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]'', [[ Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[Black Rain (1989 Japanese film)|Black Rain]]'' and [[ Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[I Live in Fear]]'' have all been associated with the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|title=BLACK RAIN: Reflections on Hiroshima and Nuclear War in Japanese Film|author=|date=|website=www.crosscurrents.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174259/http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known examples of ''mono no aware'' in contemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, found throughout Japanese art and perpetuated by the large masses of people that travel annually to view and picnic under cherry trees. The trees are not considered to be of special value concerning their beauty in relation to other trees, such as apple or pear trees. Cherry tree blossoms are valued because of their transience, normally associated with the fact that the blossoms fall off the tree after only a week or so after first budding. It is the evanescence of the beauty of the cherry blossom that evokes the weary perspective of ''mono no aware'' in the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Milestones ==
[[File:Map_of_East_Asia.png|thumb|312x312px|Modern East Asia]]

In 2003, [[South Korea]] became the world's first music market where digital music sales surpassed those of physical formats.&lt;ref name="8thlargest"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marchand|first=Ruby|title=Trade Mission Engages Key Korean Music Professionals|url=http://www.grammy.com/blogs/trade-mission-engages-key-korean-music-professionals|publisher=[[Grammy Award]]|accessdate=2013-01-14|quote=...It's also the first country where digital surpassed physical sales.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClure|first=Steve|title=Billboard Vol. 118, No. 18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|publisher=Billboard|year=2006|issn=0006-2510|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Japan]] surpassed the [[United States]] as the world's largest recorded music market for the first time, according to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. Though the U.S. remained the largest if licensing fees are included into the figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan surpasses US as world's biggest recorded music market|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/tech-biz/04/09/13/japan-surpasses-us-worlds-biggest-recorded-music-market|author=[[Kyodo News]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News Channel]]|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following year, Japan fell back to the second-largest music market after experiencing a 16.7 per cent decrease due to the country's reliance of CDs and slow adoption of digital services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan drags down global music market|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26626396|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303287804579447222439275740|title=Japan Hits a Sour Note on Music Sales|author1=Karp, Hannah|author2=Inada, Miho|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast with the global music industry ==
Although global physical music sales (such as CDs) have been declining in recent years, in [[East Asia]] (particularly [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), however, physical music sales have been rising consistently.&lt;ref name="ifpi" /&gt;

The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] credits this phenomenon to "[[K-Pop]] fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets".&lt;ref name="ifpi"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1549940/francis-keeling-universal-musics-global-head-of-digital|title= Francis Keeling, Universal Music’s Global Head of Digital Business: Google Streaming Service ‘Is the Biggest Funnel We Can Have’|accessdate= 7 May 2013|publisher=''[[Billboard magazine]]''|quote=According to IFPI, global physical format sales declined from 61% in 2011 to an estimated 58% in 2012. However, in Japan, CD and DVD sales posted strong increases (sales numbers or percentages were not provided). While in South Korea physical sales are expected to rise for the third consecutive year, with IFPI crediting K-Pop fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets, with driving the format's sustained popularity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a music executive from [[Universal Music Group]], CDs are becoming "the new merchandise in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindvall|first=Helienne|title=How K-Pop &amp; J-Pop Are Saving Physical Music Sales|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|publisher=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518191654/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Several controversies have arrived based on the way the industry has been treating its artists.

=== Control of artists personal lives ===
It is not uncommon for record labels to prohibit their pop artists from dating for a certain period of time or for as long as they have a contract with the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/3-ways-the-japanese-entertainment-industry-keeps-idol-singers-from-dating|title=3 ways the Japanese entertainment industry keeps idol singers from dating|work=Japan Today|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artists who break this contract, as in the case of [[Minami Minegishi]] from [[AKB48]], run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35368705|title=The dark side of Asia’s pop music industry|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=2016|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Taiwan, artists are also expected to behave in certain ways, as they cannot discuss taboo topics such as politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3463">'''Nanyang Style''' is a regional art movement expressed solely in the form of visual art. The first attempts to define the Nanyang Style were made by art historians, [[Redza Piyadasa]] and T.K. Sabapathy, in 1979, during a retrospective study of Nanyang artists’ works. This study was done in tribute to the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] (NAFA). The Nanyang style of painting was practised by migrant Chinese painters in Singapore in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Balagopal | first = Roberta | author2 = Yeo, Alicia | title = The Nanyang Style | publisher = [[National Library Board]] | date = 31 August 2009 | url = http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1626_2009-12-31.html | format = article | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110310064215/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1626_2009-12-31.html | archivedate = 10 March 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Chinese phrase 'nanyang' “南洋”, meaning south seas, stirred visions of tropical paradise. In the mid-20th century, a group of Chinese immigrants founded the Nanyang Style of art in [[Southeast Asia]] when they portrayed the rural scenes of Bali.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news | last = Yeo | first = Alicia | title = Singapore Art, ''Nanyang'' Style | newspaper = biblioasia | location = Singapore | pages = 4–11 | publisher = [[National Library Board]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0201Apr06.pdf | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227060158/http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0201Apr06.pdf | archivedate = 2012-02-27 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nanyang'' artists==
The pioneers of the Nanyang Style are [[Liu Kang (artist)|Liu Kang]], [[Chen Chong Swee]], [[Chen Wen Hsi]], [[Cheong Soo Pieng]] and [[Georgette Chen]], the first four of whom had received training in traditional Chinese watercolor painting in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Ting Szu Kiong | title = Nanyang Art | publisher = Central Singapore Community Development Council | year = 2005 | url = http://www.centralsingapore.org.sg/site/voices/voices8/page9.shtml | format = article | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091227173533/http://www.centralsingapore.org.sg/site/voices/voices8/page9.shtml | archivedate = 2009-12-27 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Redza Piyadasa states that Nanyang artists must be affiliated to NAFA, or a teacher or student in the school. This includes artists who studied privately under NAFA teachers.

==Styles==
The primary medium of Nanyang Style is Chinese ink and colour, or oil on canvas. A simple use of colours and lines is similar to those of [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionists]], such as [[Vincent van Gogh]]. The art style reflects the universal culture of migrants, who in this case adapted to and accepted a new mix of Western, Chinese and indigenous beliefs and practices.

==Controversies==
During the opening address of the ''Nanyang Art Over 40 years'' exhibition, [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|Acting Minister of Information, Communications and the Arts]] [[Lui Tuck Yew]] commentated that the Nanyang Style is not too distinctive on its own, being very similar to Chinese art.&lt;ref&gt;http://newslink.asiaone.com/user/UserSearch.action&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}

The '''New Wave''' is a movement in [[science fiction]] produced in the 1960s and 1970s and characterized by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, a "literary" or artistic sensibility, and a focus on "[[Soft science fiction|soft]]" as opposed to hard science. New Wave writers often saw themselves as part of the [[Literary modernism|modernist]] tradition and sometimes mocked the traditions of [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] science fiction, which some of them regarded as stodgy, adolescent and poorly written.&lt;ref&gt;Moorcock, Michael. "Play with Feeling." ''New Worlds'' 129 (April 1963), pp. 123-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Wave science fiction of the 1960s emphasized stylistic experimentation and literary merit over scientific accuracy or prediction. It was conceived as a deliberate break from the traditions of pulp SF, which many of the writers involved considered irrelevant and unambitious. It was, according to academic [[Brian McHale]], the edge of science fiction which ambitioned it to reach literary status, making it a case, among all of the arts, which were to constitute the emergence of [[postmodernism]].

The most prominent source of New Wave science fiction was the magazine ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' under the editorship of [[Michael Moorcock]], who assumed the position in 1964. Moorcock sought to use the magazine to "define a new avant-garde role" for science fiction&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian (November 1996). "The Third Generation of Genre Science Fiction". Science Fiction Studies 23 (3): 321–330&lt;/ref&gt; by the use of "new literary techniques and modes of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike, (2005), ''Transformations. The Story of the Science Fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970'', pp251-252&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a period marked by the emergence of a greater variety of voices in science fiction, most notably the rise in the number of female writers, including  [[Joanna Russ]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and [[James Tiptree, Jr.]].

== Name ==
The term "New Wave" is borrowed from the French film movement the ''[[nouvelle vague]]''.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;Wolfe, Gary G (2005) "Coming to Terms" in ''Speculations on Speculation. Theories of Science Fiction'', James Gunn and Matthew Candelaria (Ed.), Scarecrow Press Inc, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary K. Wolfe]], professor of humanities and English at [[Roosevelt University]], identifies the introduction of the term New Wave to science fiction&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt; as occurring in 1966 in an essay&lt;ref&gt;Merril, Judith (1966) "Books", pp. 30, ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' written by [[Judith Merril]],  who was indirectly yet it seems unambiguously referring to that term in order to comment on the experimental fiction that had begun to appear in the English magazine ''New Worlds'', after Michael Moorcock assumed editorship in 1964. However, Judith Merril denied she ever used that term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofmerril.org/sol19.html The 1997 Academic Conference On Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128100755/http://www.friendsofmerril.org/sol19.html |date=2012-01-28 }}, Allan Weiss, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Merril later popularized this fiction in the United States through her edited anthology ''England Swings SF: Stories of Speculative Fiction'' (Doubleday 1968), although an earlier anthology ([[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' [Doubleday 1967]) is a key harbinger of New Wave science fiction in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/03b/dv148.htm The SF Site featured review: Dangerous Visions], accessed May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/816.html Dangerous visions by Harlan Ellison: Official SFWorld.com review], accessed May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences and predecessors===
{{rquote|right|With negligible exceptions ([[H. G. Wells|Wells]], [[Olaf Stapledon|Stapledon]] and who?), nearly every science-fiction writer up to a very few years ago made one very hidden—and indefensible—assumption. They assumed that science changed; that the world changed; that everything you could imagine changed, except one thing. They assumed that the human race did not change at all.|Frederik Pohl, 1965&lt;ref name="pohl196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

Though the New Wave began in the 1960s, some of its tenets can be found in [[H. L. Gold]]'s editorship of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'', a science fiction magazine which began publication in 1950. [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] described Gold's focus as being "not on the adventurer, the inventor, the engineer, or the scientist, but on the average citizen,"&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James. "Alternate Worlds: 1949–1965", in Alternate Worlds. The Illustrated History of Science Fiction (N.J.:Prentice-Hall, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and according to SF historian David Kyle, Gold's work would lead to the New Wave.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, A Pictorial History of Science Fiction, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 wrote of the "recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940's—the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface".&lt;ref name="budrys196508"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Wave did not define itself as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp and [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]] periods had become worn out, and should be abandoned: [[J. G. Ballard]] stated in 1962 that "science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars",&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, J. G. (1962) "Which Way to Inner Space?" ''New Worlds Science Fiction'', May. Reprinted in ''A User's Guide to the Millennium: Essays and Reviews'', HarperCollins, London  (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and Brian Aldiss said in ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'' that "the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation."&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Brian and David Wingrove (eds.). ''Trillion Year Spree. The History of Science Fiction'' (London: Paladin Grafton, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] summarised the period by saying "old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison (eds.) ''Decade the 1950s'' (London: Pan Books, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

New Wave writers began to look outside the traditional scope of science fiction for influence; some looked to the example of beat writer [[William S. Burroughs]] – New Wave authors [[Philip José Farmer]] and [[Barrington J. Bayley]] wrote pastiches of his work ("The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod" and "The Four Colour Problem", respectively), while J. G. Ballard published an admiring essay in an issue of ''New Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, J. G. "Myth Maker Of The 20th century" New Worlds, No. 142, May/June 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs' use of experimentation such as the [[cut-up technique]] and his appropriation of science fiction tropes in radical ways proved the extent to which prose fiction could prove revolutionary, and some New Wave writers sought to emulate this style.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]], one of the writers to emerge in the 1960s, describes the transition to the New Wave era thus:

{{quote|Without in the least dismissing or belittling earlier writers and work, I think it is fair to say that science fiction changed around 1960, and that the change tended toward an increase in the number of writers and readers, the breadth of subject, the depth of treatment, the sophistication of language and technique, and the political and literary consciousness of the writing. The sixties in science fiction were an exciting period for both established and new writers and readers. All the doors seemed to be opening.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula K. "Introduction". In Ursula K. Le Guin and Brian Attebery (eds.), ''The Norton Book of Science Fiction'', (New York: W. W. Norton, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} }}

Critic [[Rob Latham]] identifies three trends that linked the advent of the New Wave in the 1960s to the emergence of [[cyberpunk]] in the 1980s. He said that changes in technology as well as an economic [[Recession of 1958|recession]] constricted the market for science fiction, generating a "widespread" malaise among fans, while established writers were forced to reduce their output (or, like [[Isaac Asimov]], shifted their emphasis to other subjects); finally, editors encouraged fresh approaches that earlier ones discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, Rob (2007) "Cyberpunk and the New Wave: Ruptures and Continuities", ''New York Review of Science Fiction'', June, Number 226, Vol. 19, No. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===

There is no consensus on a precise starting point of the New Wave – [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] refers to [[Alfred Bester]] as having singlehandedly invented the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam. The History of Science Fiction (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the introduction to a collection of [[Leigh Brackett]]'s short fiction, Michael Moorcock referred to her as one of the genre's "true godmothers".&lt;ref&gt;Brackett, Leigh (2000) ''Martian Quest: The Early Brackett'', Haffner Press (introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Budrys said that in New Wave writers "there are echoes ... of [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Walter Miller, Jr.]] and, by all odds, [[Fritz Leiber]]".&lt;ref name="budrys196710"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is widely accepted among critics that the New Wave began in England with the magazine ''New Worlds'' and [[Michael Moorcock]]. who was appointed editor in 1964 (first issue number 142, May and June&lt;ref&gt;Greenland, Colin. ''The Entropy Exhibition'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-7100-9310-3}}).

Theories of Science Fiction'' (Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc., 2005). Page number refer to this reprint&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|251}})&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
For example:

1) Luckhurst, Roger. ''Science Fiction'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2005)

"What became known as the New Wave in SF was centred in England on the Magazine ''New Worlds'', edited with missionary zeal by Michael Moorcock between 1964 and 1970 …"{{rp|141}}

2) James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)

"In April 1963 Michael Moorcock contributes a guest editorial to John Carnell's ''New Worlds'', Britain's leading SF magazine, which effectively announced the onset of the New Wave."{{rp|167}}

3) Roberts, Adam. ''The History of Science Fiction'' (New York: Palgrove Macmillan, 2005)

"It [the New Wave] was initially associated with the London magazine ''New Worlds'', … which was reconfigured as a venue for experimental and unconventional fiction in the 1960s, particularly under the editorship of Michael Moorcock from 1964 …"{{rp|231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the American magazines ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', with Cele Goldsmith as editor, and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' had from the start printed unusually literary stories, Moorcock turned that into a concerted policy. No other science fiction magazine sought as consistently to distance itself from traditional science fiction as much as ''New Worlds''. By the time it ceased regular publication it had backed away from the science fiction genre itself, styling itself as an [[experimental fiction|experimental]] [[literary journal]].

Under Moorcock's editorship "galactic wars went out; drugs came in; there were fewer encounters with aliens, more in the bedroom. Experimentation in prose styles became one of the orders of the day, and the baleful influence of William Burroughs often threatened to gain the upper hand."&lt;ref name="aldiss1"&gt;Aldiss, Brian W. ''The Detached Retina'' (Liverpool University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} [[Judith Merril]] observed:

{{quote| this magazine [''New Worlds''] was the publishing thermometer of the trend that was dubbed "the New Wave". In the United States the trend created an intense, incredible controversy. In Britain people either found it of interest or they didn't, but in the States it was heresy on the one hand and wonderful revolution on the other.&lt;ref name="merril1" /&gt;{{rp|162–163}}}} As an anthologist and speaker Merril with other authors advocated a reestablishment of science fiction within the literary mainstream and higher literary standards. Her "incredible controversy" is characterized by David Hartwell in the opening sentence of a book chapter entitled "New Wave: The Great War of the 1960s": "Conflict and argument are an enduring presence in the SF world, but literary politics has yielded to open warfare on the largest scale only once."&lt;ref name="hart1"&gt;Hartwell, David. ''Age of Wonders'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}} The heresy was beyond the experimental and explicitly provocative as inspired by Burroughs. In all coherence with the literary ''nouvelle vague'' although not in close association to it, and addressing a much less restricted pool of readers, the New Wave was reversing the standard hero's attitude toward action and science. It illustrated egotism - by depriving the plot of all motivation toward a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James (2005) "The Readers of Hard Science Fiction" in Speculations on Speculation. Theories of Science Fiction, James Gunn and Matthew Candelaria (Ed.), Scarecrow Press Inc, Maryland :87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Moorcock wrote:

{{quote|Let's have a quick look at what a lot of science fiction lacks. Briefly, these are some of the qualities I miss on the whole – passion, subtlety, irony, original characterization, original and good style, a sense of involvement in human affairs, colour, density, depth, and, on the whole, real feeling from the writer...&lt;ref&gt;Moorcock, Michael. "Guest Editorial", ''New Worlds'', 129 (April 1963), 2 and 123. Reprinted in: James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, page 168, 1994,)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1962 Ballard wrote:

{{quote| I've often wondered why s-f shows so little of the experimental enthusiasm which has characterized painting, music and the cinema during the last four or five decades, particularly as these have become wholeheartly speculative, more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind, constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid. …
The biggest developments of the immediate future will take place, not on the Moon or Mars, but on Earth, and it is ''inner space'', not outer, that need to be explored. The only truly alien planet is Earth. In the past the scientific bias of s-f has been towards the physical sciences – rocketry, electronics, cybernetics – and the emphasis should switch to the biological sciences. Accuracy, that last refuge of the unimaginative, doesn't matter a hoot. …

It is that ''inner'' space-suit which is still needed, and it is up to science fiction to build it!&lt;ref name="ballard1" /&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

Moorcock, Ballard, and others engendered much animosity from the established SF community.{{cn|date=December 2017}} When reviewing ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', [[Lester del Rey]] described it as "the first of the New Wave-Thing movies, with the usual empty symbolism".&lt;ref name="delrey196807"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budrys in ''Galaxy'', when reviewing a collection of recent stories from the magazine, said in 1965 that "There is this sense in this book ... that modern science fiction reflects a dissatisfaction with things as they are, sometimes to the verge of indignation, but also retains optimism about the eventual outcome".{{r|budrys196508}} When reviewing ''[[World's Best Science Fiction: 1966]]'' he mocked Ellison's "[['Repent, Harlequin!'

{{quote|A story by J. G. Ballard, as you know, calls for people who don't think. One begins with characters who regard the physical universe as a mysterious and arbitrary place, and who would not dream of trying to understand its actual laws. Furthermore, in order to be the protagonist of a J. G. Ballard novel, or anything more than a very minor character therein, you must have cut yourself off from the entire body of scientific education. In this way, when the world disaster – be it wind or water – comes upon you, you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything about it but sit and worship it. Even more further, some force has acted to remove from the face of the world all people who might impose good sense or rational behavior on you, so that the disaster proceeds unchecked and unopposed except by the almost inevitable thumb-rule engineer type who for his individual comfort builds a huge pyramid (without huge footings) to resist high winds, or trains a herd of alligators and renegade divers to help him out in dealing with deep water.{{r|budrys196612}}}}

Despite his criticism of Ballard and Aldiss ("the least talented" of the four), Budrys called them, [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Samuel R. Delany]] "an earthshaking new kind" of writers.{{r|budrys196710}} Asimov said in 1967 of the New Wave, "I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction",{{r|asimov196708}} but Budrys that year warned that the four would soon leave those "still reading everything from the viewpoint of the 1944 ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'' ... nothing but a complete collection of yellowed, crumble-edged bewilderment".{{r|budrys196710}} While acknowledging the New Wave's "energy, high talent and dedication", and stating that it "may in fact be the shape of tomorrow's science fiction generally — hell, it may be the shape of today's science fiction", as examples of the movement Budrys much preferred Zelazny's ''[[This Immortal]]'' to [[Thomas Disch]]{{'}}s ''The Genocide''. Predicting that Zelazny's career would be more important and lasting than Disch's, he described the latter's book as "unflaggingly derivative of" the New Wave and filled with "dumb, resigned victims" who "run, hide, slither, grope and die", like Ballard's ''[[The Drowned World]]'' but unlike ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' ("about people who do something about their troubles").&lt;ref name="budrys196612"&gt;{{Cite magazine

{{quote|Literary movements tend to be compounded, in various proportions, of the genius of two or three genuinely original talents, some few other capable or established writers who have been co-opted or gone along for the ride, the apprentice work of epigones and wannabes, and a great deal of hype.

''The Dreams our Stuff is Made of'' (New York: The Free Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}}}

Roger Luckhurst pointed out that Ballard's essay "Which Way to Inner Space?"&lt;ref name="ballard1"&gt;Ballard, J. G. "Which Way to Inner Space?", ''New Worlds'', 118 (May 1962), 117. Reprinted in: Ballard, J. G. ''A User's Guide to the Millennium'' (London: Harper-Collins, page 197, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; "showed the influence of media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] and the 'anti-psychiatry' of [[R. D. Laing]]."&lt;ref name="luck"&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. ''Science Fiction'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} Luckhurst traces the influence of both these thinkers in Ballard's fiction, in particular ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' (1970)&lt;ref name="luck" /&gt;{{rp|152}} 

Another central concern of the New Wave was a fascination with [[entropy]]{{r|budrys196612}} –  that the world (and the universe) must tend to disorder, to eventually run down to 'heat death'. Ballard provided

{{quote|an explicitly cosmological vision of entropic decline of the universe in his magisterial story "The Voices of Time", which appeared in 1960. It provided a matrix of ideas that subsequent New Wave writing teased out in various contexts. Perhaps the best instance of this elaboration was [[Pamela Zoline]]'s "The Heat Death of the Universe."&lt;ref name="ballard1" /&gt;{{rp|158}}}}

Like other writers for ''New Worlds'' Zoline uses "science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life", and by doing so produces "altered perceptions of reality in the reader."&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}}

Judith Merril, "whose annual anthologies were the first heralds of the coming of the [New Wave] cult,"&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Donald A. ''The Universe Makers. Science Fiction Today'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} writing in 1967 in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' contrasts the SF New Wave (which she here terms 'The New Thing') in England and the United States:

{{quote|They call it the New Thing.

The people who call it that mostly don't like it, and the only general agreements they seem to have are that Ballard is its Demon and I am its prophetess – and that it is what is wrong with Tom Disch, and with British s-f in general. …

The American counterpart is less cohesive as a "school" or "movement": it has had no single publication in which to concentrate its development, and was, in fact, till recently, all but excluded from the regular s-f magazines. But for the same reasons, it is more diffuse and perhaps more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Merril, Judith. "Books" ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', November 1967&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}}}

Judith Merril's annual anthologies (1957–1968&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestsf.net/category/reviews/years-best/merril/ "Best SF - reviews and contents of Merril anthologies"] Retrieved 2011-01-27&lt;/ref&gt;), Damon Knight's ''[[Orbit (anthology series)|Orbit]]'' series, and Harlan Ellison's ''Dangerous Visions'' featured American writers inspired by British writers (although some of the writers anthologized were British).&lt;ref name="landon"&gt;Landon, Brooks. ''Science Fiction after 1900. From the Steam Man to the Stars'' (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156}} Brooks Landon, professor of English at the University of Iowa, says of ''Dangerous Visions'' that it

{{quote|was innovative and influential before it had any readers simply because it was the first big original anthology of SF, offering prices to its writers that were competitive with the magazines. The readers soon followed, however, attracted by 33 stories by SF writers both well-established and relatively unheard of. These writers responded to editor Harlan Ellison's call for stories that could not be published elsewhere or had never been written in the face of almost certain censorship by SF editors. Among the stories Ellison received were the almost [[James Joyce|Joycean]] "[[Riders of the Purple Wage]]," by [[Philip Jose Farmer]], "[[Carcinoma Angels]]", by [[Norman Spinrad]], and "[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]…" by [[Samuel R.

''Dangerous Visions'' marks an emblematic turning point for American SF.&lt;ref name="landon" /&gt;{{rp|157}}}}

The New Wave also had a political subtext:

{{quote|Most of the 'classic' writers had begun writing before the Second World War, and were reaching middle age by the early 1960s; the writers of the so-called New Wave were mostly born during or after the war, and were not only reacting against the sf writers of the past, but playing their part in the general youth revolution of the 1960s which had such profound effects upon Western culture. It is no accident that the New Wave began in Britain at the time of [[the Beatles]], and took off in the United States at the time of the [[hippies]] – both, therefore at a time of cultural innovation and generational shake-up …&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|167}}}}

[[Eric S. Raymond]], looking at the New Wave with an even narrower political focus, observed:

{{quote|The New Wave's inventors (notably Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss) were British socialists and Marxists who rejected individualism, linear exposition, happy endings, scientific rigor and the U.S.'s [[cultural hegemony]] over the SF field in one fell swoop. The New Wave's later American exponents were strongly associated with the New Left and opposition to the Vietnam War, leading to some rancorous public disputes in which politics was tangled together with definitional questions about the nature of SF and the direction of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sf-history.html "A Political History of SF"] Retrieved 2010-10-10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, Judith Merril, "one of the most visible -- and voluble -- apostles of the New Wave in 1960s sf"&lt;ref name="latham2"&gt;Latham, Rob. "Sextrapolation in New Wave Science Fiction", ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (Jul., 2006), pp. 251–274: page 251&lt;/ref&gt; remembers her return from England to the United States:

{{quote|So I went home ardently looking for a revolution. I kept searching until the [[1968 Democratic Convention|Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968]]. I went to Chicago partly to seek out a revolution, if there was one happening, and partly because my seventeen-year-old daughter … wanted to go.&lt;ref name="merril1" /&gt;{{rp|167}}}}

Merril said later "At the end of the Convention week, the taste of America was sour in all our mouths,"&lt;ref name="merril1"&gt;Merril, Judith. ''Better to have Loved. The Life of Judith Merril'' (Toronto: Between the Lines, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}} and "by the end of the Sixties, Merril was a political refugee living in Canada."&lt;ref name="hart1" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

Roger Luckhurst disagreed with those critics (he gives the example of Thomas Clareson) who perceived the New Wave in terms of rupture, suggesting that such a model

{{quote|doesn't quite seem to map onto the American scene, even though the wider conflicts of the 1960s liberalization in universities, the civil rights movement and the cultural contradictions inherent in consumer society were starker and certainly more violent than in Britain. The young turks within SF also had an ossified 'ancient regime' to topple: [[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]]'s intolerant right-wing editorials for 'Astounding Science Fiction' (which he renamed 'Analog' in 1960) teetered on the self parody. In 1970, when the campus revolt against American involvement in Vietnam reached its height and resulted in the [[Kent State shootings|National Guard shooting four students dead in Kent State University]], Campbell editorialized that the 'punishment was due', and rioters should expect to be met with lethal force. Vietnam famously divided the SF community to the extent that, in 1968, 'Galaxy' magazine carried two adverts, one signed by writers in favour and one by those against the war.&lt;ref name="luck" /&gt;{{rp|160}}&lt;ref name="vietnamads"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=June 1968 |title=Paid Advertisement |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=4-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Caution is needed when assessing any literary movement. Science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]], reacting to his association with another SF movement in the 1980s, remarked:

{{quote| When did the New Wave SF end? Who was the last New Wave SF writer? You can't be a New Wave SF writer today. You can recite the numbers of them: Ballard, Ellison, Spinrad, Delaney, blah, blah, blah. What about a transitional figure like Zelazny? A literary movement isn't an army. You don't wear a uniform and swear allegiance. It's just a group of people trying to develop a sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;Myer, Thomas. [http://www.sfsite.com/09a/bru16.htm "Chatting with Bruce Sterling at LoneStarCon 2"] Retrieved 2010-10-10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly Rob Latham observed:

{{quote|... indeed, one of the central ways the New Wave was experienced, in the US and Britain, was as a "liberated" outburst of erotic expression, often counterpoised, by advocates of the "New Thing"(as Merril called it), with the priggish Puritanism of the Golden Age. Yet this stark contrast, while not unreasonable, tends ultimately, as do most of the historical distinctions drawn between the New Wave and its predecessors, to overemphasize rupture at the expense of continuity, effectively "disappearing" some of the pioneering trends in 1950s sf that paved the way for the New Wave's innovations.&lt;ref name="latham2" /&gt;{{rp|252}}}}

Bearing this proviso in mind it is still possible to sum up the New Wave in terms of rupture as is done for example by Darren Harris-Fain of [[Shawnee State University]]:

{{quote|The split between the New Wave and everyone else in American SF during the late 1960s was nearly as dramatic as the division at the same time between young protesters and what they called "the establishment," and in fact, the political views of the younger writers, often prominent in their work, reflect many contemporary concerns. New Wave accused what became de facto the old wave of being old-fashioned, patriarchal, imperialistic, and obsessed with technology; many of the more established writers thought the New Wave shallow, said that its literary innovations were not innovations at all (which in fact, outside of SF, they were not), and accused it of betraying SF's grand view of humanity's role in the universe. Both assertions were largely exaggerations, of course, and in the next decade both trends would merge into a synthesis of styles and concerns. However, in 1970 the issue was far from settled and would remain a source of contention for the next few years.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|13–14}}}}

===Decline and lasting influence===

In the opening paragraph of an essay&lt;ref name="latham3"&gt;Latham, Rob. 'New Worlds and the New Wave in Fandom: Fan Culture and the Reshaping of Science Fiction in the Sixties' in 'Extrapolation'. (Kent State Univ., Kent, OH) (47:2) [Summer 2006], pp. 296–315: page 296&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296}} on the New Wave Rob Latham relates that

{{quote| In the August 1970 issue of the SFWA Forum, a publication circulated to members of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], Harlan Ellison remarked that the controversy over the New Wave, which had consumed the field during the late 1960s, seemed to have been "blissfully laid to rest." There never was, he claimed,

{{quote| any real conflict among the writers. It was all a manufactured controversy, staged by fans to hype their own participation in the genre. Their total misunderstanding of what was happening (not unusual for fans, as history … shows us) managed to stir up a great deal of pointless animosity and if it had any real effect I suspect it was in the unfortunate area of causing certain writers to feel they were unable to keep up and consequently they slowed their writing output.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Harlan. 'Letter to the Editor' ''SFWA Forum 15'' (August 1970): 27–28. Quoted in Latham, Rob. 'New Worlds and the New Wave in Fandom: Fan Culture and the Reshaping of Science Fiction in the Sixties' in ''Extrapolation''. (Kent State Univ., Kent, OH) (47:2) [Summer 2006], pp.296–315&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Latham remarks that this analysis by Harlan Ellison "obscures Ellison's own prominent role – and that of other professional authors and editors such as Judith Merril, Michael Moorcock, Lester Del Rey, Frederik Pohl, and Donald A. Wollheim – in fomenting the conflict, …"

&lt;ref name="latham3" /&gt;{{rp|296}}

In the early 1970s a number of writers and readers pointed out that

{{quote| winners of the [[Nebula Award]]s, created by the Science Fiction Writers of America (SWFA) in 1965, tended to be very different from recipients of the [[Hugo Award]]s, given by fans at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention]] (the Worldcon), arguing that this highlighted the fact that many writers had departed from readers' tastes into self-indulgence.  …

While some writers and fans continued to argue about the New Wave until the end of the 1970s – in ''The World of Science Fiction, 1926–1976: The History of a Subculture'', for instance, Lester Del Ray devotes several pages to castigating the movement – for the most part the controversy died down as the decade wore on.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|20}}}}

The closing of New Worlds magazine in 1970 "marked the containment of New Wave experiment with the rest of the counter-culture. The various limping manifestations of New World across the 1970s … demonstrated the posthumous nature of its avant-gardism.&lt;ref name="luck" /&gt;{{rp|168}}

In an essay ''The Alien Encounter'' Professor [[Patrick Parrinder]] stated that "any meaningful act of defamiliarization can only be relative, since it is not possible for man to imagine what is utterly alien to him; the utterly alien would also be meaningless."&lt;ref name="parrinder"&gt;Parrinder, Patrick. 'The Alien Encounter: Or, Ms Brown and Mrs Le Guin' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1979), pp. 46–58&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} He continues later:

{{quote| Within SF, however, it is not necessary to break with the wider conventions of prose narrative in order to produce work that is validly experimental. The "New Wave" writing of the 1960s, with its fragmented and surrealistic forms, has not made a lasting impact, because it cast its net too wide. To reform SF one must challenge the conventions of the genre on their own terms.&lt;ref name="parrinder" /&gt;{{rp|55–56}}}}

Veteran science fiction writer [[Jack Williamson]] (1908–2006) when asked in 1991: "Did the [New] Wave's emphasis on experimentalizm and its conscious efforts to make SF more 'literary' have any kind of permanent effects on the field?" replied:

{{quote| After it subsided -- it's old hat now -- it probably left us with a sharpened awareness of language and a keener interest in literary experiment. It did wash up occasional bits of beauty and power. For example, it helped launch the careers of such writers as [Samuel R] Chip Delany, Brian Aldiss, and Harlan Ellison, all of whom seem to have gone on their own highly individualistic directions. But the key point here is that New Wave SF failed to move people. I'm not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious. But it never really [[Sense of wonder|grabbed hold of people's imaginations]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry McCaffery and Jack Williamson. 'An Interview with Jack Williamson' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jul., 1991), pp. 230–252: page 234&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been observed that

{{quote| there is something efficacious in sf's marginality and always tenuous self-identity -- its ambiguous generic distinction from other literary categories -- and, perhaps more importantly, in its distinction from what has variously been called realist, mainstream, or mundane fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Elizabeth. 'Generic Exhaustion and the "Heat Death" of Science Fiction' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 21, No. 3 (Nov., 1994), pp. 289–301&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}}}}

Hartwell maintained that after the New Wave, science fiction had still managed to retain this "marginality and tenuous self-identity":

{{quote| The British and American New Wave in common would have denied the genre status of SF entirely and ended the continual development of new specialized words and phrases common to the body of SF, without which SF would be indistinguishable from mundane fiction in its entirety (rather than only out on the borders of experimental SF, which is properly indistinguishable from any other experimental literature). The denial of special or genre status is ultimately the cause of the failure of the New Wave to achieve popularity, which, if it had become truly dominant, would have destroyed SF as a separate field.&lt;ref name="hart1" /&gt;{{rp|153}}}}

Scientific accuracy was more important than literary style to Campbell, and top ''Astounding'' contributors Asimov, Heinlein, and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] were trained scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name="latham2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9781135228361 |editor-last=Bould |editor-first=Mark |pages=80-89 |chapter=Fiction, 1950-1963 |editor-last2=Butler |editor-first2=Andrew M. |editor-last3=Roberts |editor-first3=Adam |editor-last4=Vint |editor-first4=Sherryl |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CNAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=QpsnWwPrOs&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov said in 1967 "I hope that when the New Wave has deposited its froth and receded, the vast and solid shore of ''science'' fiction will appear once more".&lt;ref name="asimov196708"&gt;{{Cite magazine

The History of Science Fiction'' (London: Paladin Grafton, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|388}} Asimov himself was to illustrate just how that "SF shore" did indeed re-emerged, vast, solid—but changed. A biographer noted that during the 1960s

{{quote| stories and novels that Asimov must not have liked and must have felt were not part of the science fiction he had helped to shape were winning acclaim and awards. He also must have felt that science fiction no longer needed him. His science fiction writing, … became even more desultory and casual.

Asimov's return to serious writing in 1971 with ''The Gods Themselves'' (when much of the debate about the New Wave had dissipated) was an act of courage …&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James. ''Isaac Asimov. The Foundation of Science Fiction'' (Oxford University Press, 1982&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}}}

Darren Harris-Fain observed on this return to writing SF by Asimov that

{{quote|the novel [''The Gods Themselves''] is noteworthy for how it both shows that Asimov was indeed the same writer in the 1970s that he had been in the 1950s and that he nonetheless had been affected by the New Wave even if he was never part of it. His depiction of an alien ménage a trois, complete with homoerotic scenes between the two males, marks an interesting departure from his earlier fiction, in which sex of any sort is conspicuously absent. Also there is some minor experimentation with structure.&lt;ref name="harfain" /&gt;{{rp|43}}}}

Other themes dealt with in the novel are concerns for the environment and "human stupidity and the delusional belief in human superiority", both frequent topics in New Wave SF.&lt;ref name="harfain"&gt;Darren Harris-Fain. ''Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction. The Age of Maturity, 1970–2000'' (University of South Carolina, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

Commenting in 2002 on the publication of the 35th Anniversary edition of the ''Dangerous Visions'' anthology edited by Harlan Ellison, the critic Greg L. Johnson remarked that

{{quote|if the New Wave did not entirely revolutionize the way SF was written, (the exploration of an invented world through the use of an adventure plot remains the prototypical SF story outline), they did succeed in pushing the boundaries of what could be considered SF, and their use of stylistic innovations from outside SF helped raise standards. It became less easy for writers to get away with stock characters spouting wooden dialogue laced with technical jargon. Such stories still exist, and are still published, but are no longer typical of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/03b/dv148.htm ''Dangerous Visions, 35th Anniversary Edition''] Retrieved 2010-10-16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Asimov agreed that "on the whole, the New Wave was a good thing".&lt;ref name="asimov"&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''Asimov on Science Fiction'' (London: Granada, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} He described several "interesting side effects" of the New Wave. Non-American SF became more prominent and the genre became international phenomenon. Other changes noted were that

{{quote|the New Wave encouraged more and more women to begin reading and writing science fiction…. The broadening of science fiction meant that it was approaching the 'mainstream' … in style and content. It also meant that increasing numbers of mainstream novelists were recognizing the importance of changing technology and the popularity of science fiction, and were incorporating science fiction motifs into their own novels.&lt;ref name="asimov" /&gt;{{rp|138–139}}}}

The noted academic writer on science fiction [[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]] described the New Wave and its impact as follows:

{{quote| The American New Wave was, on the whole, quite unlike the British. The latter was effectively a group of people associated with a magazine that had a particular programme …, whereas even those American writers who gathered in London at the time, like [Samuel R] Delaney,  [Thomas M] Disch, and [John] Sladek, were individuals pursuing their ''own'' ends, not those of Ballard or Moorcock. As a 'movement', the American New Wave was even less real than the British; it was no more than a concatenation of talent flourishing at the same time and bringing new ideas and new standards to the writing of sf. The British New Wave had few lasting effects, even in Britain; the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership. No doubt the writers did not achieve this success on their own. It may be noted, for instance, that this burst of originality occurred at almost exactly the same times as the three seasons of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', which certainly contributed to the expansion of sf's readership. Whether or not much of this boom can be attributed to the American New Wave, it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s, including [[John Crowley]], [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[James Tiptree, Jr.]], and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]].&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|176}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">{{unref|date=June 2013}}The '''North American Nature Photography Association''' or '''NANPA''' is an organization dedicated to [[photography]] of nature. Its headquarters were in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, and are now in Alma, Illinois. Established in 1994, the association has 2,500 members. Several categories of membership are available, including discounts for students. The association annually sponsors a variety of activities, such as regional events, meetups, workshops, tours, and webinars throughout the United States. The NANPA Foundation [www.nanpafoundation.org], established in 1997, awards scholarships, operates blinds for [[wildlife photography]], and organizes funds in memory of deceased photographers and others. NANPA also markets books of interest to members, including those by members, through [[Amazon.com]]. 

In 2006, NANPA initiated June 15 as Nature Photography Day. This designated day was spearheaded by the association’s History Committee. Its purpose is to promote the art and science of nature photography. NANPA looks to esthetic elements and practical ones, too. Photography has been used to rescue animals, plants, and habitats locally and worldwide. Participation in Nature Photography Day has since extended worldwide. June 15 is a day that encourages exploring, with a camera, the natural world within walking, hiking, biking, or rowing distance--to avoid leaving a carbon footprint. Among the numerous ways to celebrate the day is to experiment with taking photographs of a familiar subject, turning the ordinary into something extraordinary. NANPA also encourages participants to learn about the experiences of nature photographers--legends of the past and today.            

NANPA's Summits, begun in 1995, bring together nature photography professionals from throughout the continent and the world. Recent Summits have been held in Jacksonville, Florida (2013 and 2017); and San Diego, California (2015). The event is scheduled for Las Vegas in 2019. Each Summit features major presentations by distinguished people in the nature photography profession, an awards celebration, a trade show, portfolio reviews, workshops (breakout sessions), and vendor demonstrations. Lightning talks were a recent feature at Summits: a series of six-minute presentations by NANPA members on techniques, anecdotes, and related information.

'''Pocko''' is an independent press and a creative agency headquartered in London, with offices in Los Angeles, and Milan. Pocko has three main fields of operation: publishing - under their publishing arm, Pocko Editions; a communication and creative consultancy, Pocko Lab; and a talent agency, Pocko People - representing illustrators, graphic designers, animators and photographers. 

== History ==

Pocko was founded in 1999 by [[Royal College of Arts]] photography graduate, Nicola Schwartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notnews.it/51eng.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819032117/http://www.notnews.it/51eng.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocko’s first initiative was the Pocko Collection in collaboration with [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]] in 2002, a series of pocket size books composed by different artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laweekly.com/2002-06-27/art-books/the-pocko-collection/&lt;/ref&gt; The mini books with ten titles showcased talented illustrators and photographers, with a few designed as pull out postcards. The books were retailed in [[Selfridges]], and were the first selection of widely distributed art to combine publishing with brand communication. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== Communications and creative work ==

Pocko Labs' former clients have included a variety of international companies from [[Disney]], [[MTV]], [[Paramount Comedy 1]], the [[New York Times]], [[Chronicle Books]], [[Oracle Team USA|BMW Oracle Racing]], to [[Eni]] and [[IBM]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Major clients in the design, fashion, and retail industry include household names such as [[Iittala]], [[Gas Jeans]], [[Comme des Garcons]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Cacharel]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]], [[Selfridges]], [[L'Oréal]], and [[Top Shop]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Pocko has also created work for charities such as [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] and the [[Bambino Gesù Hospital]], a noted children's hospital in Rome.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Recent notable projects include an animation film made in collaboration with illustrator Klaus Haapaniemi for Finnish design company [[Iittala]]'s new ceramic tableware collection "Tanssi" (meaning "dance" in Finnish).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iittala.com/tanssi&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanssi animation and ceramic range was created in conjunction with a new production at the Finnish National Opera of Czech composer [[Leoš Janáček]]'s [[The Cunning Little Vixen]], for which Klaus Haapaniemi also designed the set design and costumes. The main inspiration for the animation came from Haapaniemi's work for the opera production: "Klaus had done stage design before and so we started looking at shadow puppets. We liked this resolutely 2D look... because it would stand out from all the high tech 3D animation out there.  From there we hit upon a combination of  Eastern shadow puppets and Victorian magic lantern shows, along with the richness of Baroque patterns, textures and character exuberance that appears in the Tanssi range".&lt;ref&gt;http://dotmogo.com/animation/pocko-tanssi-animation-iittala/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==

Pocko's publishing work is developed under the title Pocko Editions, and focuses on publishing illustrative and image-oriented books relating to  contemporary popular culture and art. Pocko Editions' publishing credits include [[Keaton Henson]]'s wordless graphic novel "Gloaming",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analoguebooks.co.uk/product/gloaming-by-keaton-henson |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140831142911/http://www.analoguebooks.co.uk/product/gloaming-by-keaton-henson |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |accessdate=March 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacy Hardy]]'s short story collection "Because the Night", and recording artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]]'s collection of innovative personal paintings titled "M.I.A.: No. 10".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/M-I-A-No-10-Maya-Arulpragasam/dp/190397710X&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pocko Collection ===
Pocko Collection is a series of pocketable books that 'merge art and design within the fuzzy borders of contemporary culture'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tangents.co.uk/tangents/main/2001/oct/pocko.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collection currently{{When|date=November 2015}} contains 18 books split across three series: 1 (2001), 2 (2002), 3 (2003). "The series feature a wide range of talent from Japan, Spain, Italy, Israel, USA and Scotland ... upcoming releases will draw work from Finland, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ukraine", with contributing authors [[Adam Lowe]], Klaus Haapaniemi, Maya [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Arulpragasam, Paul McDevitt, Hiro Sugiyama, [[Ori Gersht]], and Tracey Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-pocko-collection-2134946&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview in [[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] (March 2003) Pocko Editions' goal was "to publish 96 books over the next ten years, regardless of the indications of their accountants' spreadsheets".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/palm_reading/&lt;/ref&gt; Pocko Collection was partly funded by the clothing company [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]].

=== Kenton Heason - Gloaming ===
In 2012 Pocko Published English graphic illustrator and blues musician [[Keaton Henson]]'s visual journey Gloaming. The graphic novel's inspiration is born from old Scandinavian folklore and Japanese Kwaidan (ghost stories) from the Edo period. The author describes Gloaming as "a study of the things we cannot see. It is an ode to the suburbs and the creatures that come to life within its mundanity." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocko.com/content/keaton-henson-gloaming/&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the release of his graphic novel, Pocko produced an exhibition/performance of the same name at London's Blackall Studios. The exhibition featured a range of original drawings from Keaton, and centred around a unique and intimate one-on-one live performance from Keaton, who struggles with playing live in a conventional sense. Guardian writer Robbie Wojciechowski described the "magical" exhibition as "The deep guilt you feel inside you wants Keaton to share his soul with you, and he does, happily, sitting upon a stool staring out at you. You sit, you wait, he plays, and your hearts broken – all in less than five minutes. You spend your time, post performance, realising that you’ll never get to see an experience that parallels this".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefourohfive.com/music/review/keaton-henson-gloaming-blackall-studios-london-20-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stacy Hardy - Because the Night ===
In 2015 Pocko published South African journalist, writer, and multimedia artist [[Stacy Hardy]]'s Because the Night “part book, part art object” it consists of a collection of short stories with photography by Mario Pischedda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raintaxi.com/because-the-night/&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with the South African Journalist Hardy describes the project as “dealing with themes around the body, sexuality, gender and politics and trying to navigate that in the confused, weird space that is South Africa. It sits in the space between confessional literature and experimental interface”. She emphasizes the importance of the collaboration with Mario Pischedda photographs as “colliding against mine and in that conclusion evoke new meanings. There is wonderful play between his masculinity and my femininity that makes for friction and cohesion, conflict and beauty… it's a bit like a love affair on the book's pages”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournalist.org.za/art/tales-of-different-realities-frightening-worlds-and-feminism&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received critical acclaim and was widely featured in South African press, hailed as “Risky, brave and beautiful, this collection sets a new standard for the South African short story” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdlive.co.za/life/books/2015/06/12/book-review-because-the-night&lt;/ref&gt; that "challenges the fetishization and objectification of the female body".&lt;ref&gt;http://bakwamagazine.com/2015/03/05/book-review-reclaiming-the-female-body-in-stacy-hardys-fiction/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] argued that Because the Night “must be celebrated for stretching the boundaries of “acceptable” female experience in literature. It offers an empowering, escapist journey for women, especially relevant to a South African readership, where perceived danger lurking in dark public spaces severely curtails women's mobility and expression".&lt;ref&gt;http://mg.co.za/article/2015-04-07-stories-that-push-the-boundaries-of-the-female-experience&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has also received strong reviews in the international press with noted American author [[Noy Holland]]  praising the collection saying: “One can read a long way into the literature of any continent and find little which speaks so powerfully and with such candor about the life of body, the quickness of the mind to depart, as Because the Night.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.raintaxi.com/because-the-night/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

Pocko Gallery is "a curatorial entity which develops exhibition projects based around themes inspired by contemporary culture",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shift.jp.org/guide/milan/music/pocko-gallery.html&lt;/ref&gt; displaying a variety of work from illustration, photography, and graphic artists. The Pocko Gallery started out in Milan, Italy in 2008, until its relocation to the [[Dalston]] area of London, UK in early 2015. In addition, Pocko has held several exhibitions at a variety of venues including the Rocket Gallery in Tokyo; the Magma bookshops in London; the Kemistry Gallery, London; Blackall Studios, London; as well as through collaborations at the Sanderson Hotel and at [[Selfridges]] store on [[Oxford Street]].

=== Museum of Small Things ===

From 5 February to 7 March 2009, Pocko exhibited "M.O.S.T." a collaborated venture with [[Selfridges]] and designer Kit Grover, to celebrate the beauty of 'the small'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitgrover.com/work/selfridges-co/&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits ranged from objects, images, moving pictures, ideas, detritus and treasures. The "oversized cabinet of curiosities", featured work from over 20 Pocko artists alongside the work of noted British artists and designers, such as [[Grayson Perry]]; jewellery designer  [[Shaun Leane (jeweller)|Shaun Leane]]; [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], and [[Richard Wentworth (artist)|Richard Wentworth]]. According to Selfridges the exhibition consisted of "modest masterpieces, under-valued in cultures where biggest is better and mega is best".&lt;ref&gt;http://fadmagazine.com/2010/02/12/most-at-selfridges-london/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pockoshko ===

In 2009, Pocko collaborated with Magma to create a project involving 20 international, award-winning artists, including illustration artists Nomoco (Kazuko Nomoto), Paul Bower, Hennie Haworth, Dr Alderete (Jorge Alderete), and Ben Newman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.magmabooks.com/content/newsfeatures/feature.asp?c=NAF&amp;sc=94&amp;fid=40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magnetreps.com/wp/2062&lt;/ref&gt; The artists customised a series of wooden [[Matryoshka doll]]s using a variety of techniques, from oil painting, ink and watercolour to collage and soldering.

=== Kyoko Hamada - I Used To Be You ===
The first exhibition held in Pocko´s new Dalston gallery space in spring 2015, the “I Used To Be You” [[Kickstarter]] project and exhibition in spring 2015 showcased the work of New York-based photographer Kyoko Hamada. Since 2012, Kyoko Hamada has been photographing herself as the fictional character “Kikuchiyo-san”, an elderly woman.  This "amazing transformation" resulted in a collection of 99 photographs which often use humour, metaphors and storytelling to represent the process of living and ageing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/kyoko-hamada-elderly-woman_n_7307610.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.good.is/articles/artist-confronts-mortality-with-elderly-alterego&lt;/ref&gt; “I Used To Be You” series received the Grand Prize in the Portfolio category from the [[LensCulture]] International Exposure Awards and was also included in The Photolucida Critical Mass Top 50.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-exposure-awards-2012-lensculture-exposure-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.photolucida.org/cm_winners.php?aID=3877&amp;CMYear=2012&amp;event_id=14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jules Julien &amp; Labo.Art - Encounters ===
Encounters represented the latest work of Amsterdam-based French illustrator Jules Julien and Milanese fashion design initiative Labo.Art. The exhibition was first presented at [[Milan Furniture Fair|Milan Design Week]], before moving to the Pocko Gallery in London. Jules Julien's "poignant universe" is built through the use of digital painting tools and a dedication to accuracy and photographic realism: " Julien is a child of the technology generation, his work deeply rooted in its time". "Julien’s conceptual and vivid imagination" is balanced out by "wearable architecture" of Labo.Arts fashion designer Ludovica Diligu's "the sober and minimal elegance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lebonbon.co.uk/events/encounters-pocko/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090647/https://www.lebonbon.co.uk/events/encounters-pocko/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''revivalist artist''' or '''revivalist band''' is a musical group, singer, or musician dedicated to reviving interest in a musical genre from an earlier era.

Such performers are usually dedicated enthusiasts of a particular musical genre – often a style that is no longer in vogue – and act as evangelists to spread awareness and appreciation of that music to new audiences. Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.

Unlike [[tribute act]]s who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]]) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.

Unlike [[cover band]]s who are primarily populist entertainers playing [[cover versions]] of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era.  Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.

Most revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre.  Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.

==List of notable revivalist artists==

* [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] - performed historic and regional American music in his natural baritone, in addition to novelty songs sung falsetto

* [[The Blues Brothers]] - started in 1978 as revivalists of 1950s and 1960s [[blues]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[R&amp;B]] music
* [[The Jam]] - started in 1972 and evolved into the leading band of the late-1970s [[mod revival]]
* [[Joshua Rifkin]] - played a central role in the [[ragtime]] revival in the 1970s by treating the works of [[Scott Joplin]] as serious classical music rather than as nostalgia or novelty
* [[Michael Feinstein]] - began his performing career in 1986 as a revivalist of the genre of American songs written between 1920–1960 (known colloquially as the [[Great American Songbook]])
* [[Steel Panther]] - formed in 2000 as revivalists and a parody of the 1980s '[[glam metal]]' scene.
* [[The Black Crowes]] - started in 1984 as revivalists of 1970s blues-rock – eventually became writers of their own material
*[[The Stray Cats]] - a major player in the [[rockabilly]] revival of the early 1980s
*[[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]] - one of the major swing revival bands
* [[Simple Plan]] - Canadian band that was noted as punk rock revival
* [[The Sheepdogs]] - started in 2007 as revivalists of early-1970's [[roots rock]] and notable for winning the "Choose the cover" competition to become the first unsigned band on the cover of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.

The '''Rock of Cashel''' ({{lang-ga|Carraig Phádraig}} {{IPA-ga|ˈcaɾˠəɟ ˈfˠaːd̪ˠɾˠəɟ|}}), also known as Cashel of the Kings and St. Patrick's Rock, is a historic site located at [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], [[County Tipperary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==History==
[[File:rock-of-cashel-aerial-1970.jpg|thumb|left|150|Aerial view of the Rock of Cashel, circa 1970, prior to any modern work]]
According to local mythology, the Rock of Cashel originated in the [[Devil's Bit]], a mountain 20 miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) north of Cashel when St. Patrick banished [[Satan]] from a cave, resulting in the Rock's landing in [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]].&lt;ref name=sjs&gt;{{cite book|last=Seymour|first=John|title=Records of the past| volume= 6 |publisher= [[Records of the Past Exploration Society]]|year= 1907 |pages=259–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashel is reputed to be the site of the conversion of the King of Munster by [[St. Patrick]] in the 5th century.

The Rock of Cashel was the traditional seat of the [[kings of Munster]] for several hundred years prior to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]]. In 1101, the King of Munster, [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]], donated his fortress on the Rock to the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Church]].
The picturesque complex has a character of its own and is one of the most remarkable collections of [[Celtic art]] and [[medieval architecture]] to be found anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ruined"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ruined abbeys and castles of Great Britain| volume= 2|authorlink= William Howitt |first=William |last=Howitt |publisher= A.W. Bennett|year= 1864 |pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few remnants of the early structures survive; the majority of buildings on the current site date from the 12th and 13th centuries.

==Buildings on the Rock==
[[File:Cashel-Round-Tower-2012.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The Round Tower]]

The oldest and tallest of the buildings is the well preserved [[Irish round tower|'''round tower''']] (28 metres, or 90 feet), dating from c.1100. Its entrance is {{convert|12|ft|m}} from the ground, necessitated by a shallow foundation (about 3 feet) typical of round towers.  The tower was built using the [[dry stone]] method.  Modern conservationists have filled in some of the tower with mortar for safety reasons.  &lt;!-- from notice on site --&gt;

[[File:Cormacs Chapel Rock of Cashel.jpg|upright|thumb|Cormac's Chapel with parts of the cathedral on either side]]

'''Cormac's Chapel''', the chapel of King [[Cormac Mac Carthaigh]], was begun in 1127 and consecrated in 1134.&lt;ref name="Ruined"/&gt; It is a sophisticated structure, with vaulted ceilings and wide arches, drawing on contemporary European architecture and infusing unique native elements.  The Irish [[Abbot]] of [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Regensburg]], [[Dirmicius of Regensburg]], sent two of his carpenters to help in the work and the twin towers on either side of the junction of the [[nave]] and [[wikt:chancel|chancel]] are strongly suggestive of their Germanic influence, as this feature is otherwise unknown in Ireland.  Other notable features of the building include interior and exterior arcading, a [[barrel-vault]]ed roof, a carved [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over both doorways, the magnificent north doorway and chancel arch.  It contains one of the best-preserved Irish frescoes from this time period.&lt;!--12th c.?--&gt; The Chapel was constructed primarily of sandstone which has become waterlogged over the centuries, significantly damaging the interior frescoes.  Restoration and preservation required the chapel be completely enclosed in a rain-proof structure with interior dehumidifiers to dry out the stone.

[[File:Irish Cross at the Rock of Cashel.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Irish High Cross at the Rock of Cashel]]The '''Cathedral''', built between 1235 and 1270, is an [[Aisleless church|aisleless]] building of [[cruciform]] plan, having a central tower and terminating westwards in a massive residential castle. The Hall of the Vicars Choral was built in the 15th century. The [[vicars choral]] were laymen (sometimes [[minor canon]]s) appointed to assist in chanting the cathedral services. At Cashel, there were originally eight vicars choral with their own [[Seal (device)|seal]]. This was later reduced to five honorary vicars choral who appointed singing-men as their deputies, a practice which continued until 1836. The restoration of the Hall was undertaken by the [[Office of Public Works]] as a project in connection with the European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975. Through it visitors now enter the site.&lt;ref name=sjs/&gt;

In 1647, during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], [[Sack of Cashel|Cashel was sacked]] by English Parliamentarian troops under [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin]]. The Irish Confederate troops there were massacred, as were the Catholic clergy, including [[Theobald Stapleton]]. Inchiquin's troops looted or destroyed many important religious artefacts.&lt;ref name="Ruined"/&gt;

In 1749, the main cathedral roof was removed by [[Arthur Price (archbishop)|Arthur Price]], the Anglican [[Archbishop of Cashel]].&lt;ref name=sjs/&gt; Today, what remains of the Rock of Cashel has become a tourist attraction. Price's decision to remove the roof on what had been called the jewel among Irish church buildings was criticised before and since.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. John Healy, LL.D, (Anglican Rector of Kells &amp; Canon of St Patrick's, Dublin) [https://archive.org/stream/historydiocesem02healgoog#page/n104/mode/2up History of the Diocese of Meath: Vol. II. (Association for Promoting Christian Knowledge; 1908) p. 93].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] visited the Rock of Cashel during her 2011 visit to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"The Queen in Ireland: day four as it happened," ''The Telegraph'' https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/8517953/The-Queen-in-Ireland-day-four-as-it-happened.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==

[[File:Rock-of-Cashel-March-2012.JPG|thumb|Graves on the northern side of the ruins]]
The entire plateau on which the buildings and graveyard lie is walled. In the grounds around the buildings an extensive graveyard includes a number of [[high cross]]es. Scully's Cross, one of the largest and most famous high crosses here, originally constructed in 1867 to commemorate the Scully family, was destroyed in 1976 when lightning struck a metal rod that ran the length of the cross. The remains of the top of the cross now lie at the base of the cross adjacent to the rock wall.

The '''Shanghai School''' ({{zh|s=海上画派|p=Hǎishàng Huàpài}}) is a style of Chinese art present in the late 19th century and centered in [[Shanghai]]. Late 19th century China, or the last years of the [[Qing dynasty]] formed a tumultuous time in China's history. This period immediately followed the defeat of China in the [[First Opium War]] by the [[British Empire]] and opened several ports, such as Shanghai, to foreign trade. This period was further destabilized by the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and the unequal treaties signed with European imperial powers. Shanghai, as an open city, became a sort of Asian melting pot where the various European powers could freely express their influence on the city. In turn, this influence gave rise to a new middle class which supported a new style of art known as the Shanghai school. 

The three hundred years of Chinese art history prior to the advent of the Shanghai School was dominated by the [[Literati painting|Literati style]] exemplified in the paintings of [[Shen Zhou]] in the 16th century. The Shanghai style marked the first major departure from traditionalist Chinese painting by focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style and more on the visual content of the painting itself. The inspiration for this new style of painting came from 17th century eccentrics shunned by the Chinese art community at large and 18th Century [[Yangzhou]] style painters. However, the Shanghai school was characterized by its even greater form exaggeration and brighter colors. The Shanghai School was unable to gain significant traction against the traditional painting style because of greater Western interest (and money) in the Literati tradition. 

Some important artists of the Shanghai School include [[Wu Changshuo]], [[Zhao Zhiqian]], [[Ren Bonian]],&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269181 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; [[He Tianjian]], [[Xie Zhiliu]], and [[Cheng Shifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmuseumonline.org/zx/tszlcontent.jspx?type=0&amp;contentId=1505 |script-title=zh:名家艺术陈列专馆 |trans-title=Exhibition for noted painters |publisher=[[China Art Museum]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sonic Dreams Collection''''' is a 2015 [[parody]] [[art game]] by [[Arcane Kids]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. It is an unofficial game based on [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise that compiles four [[minigames]]. The minigames are presented as unfinished ''Sonic'' games and include the [[character creation|character creator]] ''Make My Sonic''; the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''Eggman Origin''; the [[interactive movie]] ''Sonic Movie Maker''; and the [[dating sim]] ''My Roommate Sonic''. They are described in-game as having been developed by a nonexistent [[Sega development studios|Sega studio]] for the [[Dreamcast]] in the late 1990s. ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' as a whole lampoons the modern ''Sonic'' [[fandom]], which is known for its peculiarities.

The game originated from concepts several individuals made during a Sonic-themed [[Valentine's Day]] event on the game-sharing website Glitch City. It was released as [[freeware]] on August 10, 2015, accompanied by a satirical [[press release]] claiming the contents were discovered in a Dreamcast [[software development kit]] Arcane Kids purchased on [[eBay]] in 2013. ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' quickly caught the attention of many [[video game journalist]]s, who were intrigued by its absurd nature and content. They characterized the game as scary and bizarre, but considered it a work people should be interested in playing and noted its commentary on the series' fandom. ''[[Geek.com]]'' went on to name ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' the best game of 2015.

==Gameplay==
In ''Sonic Dreams Collection'', the player selects one of four [[single-player]] [[parody]] [[minigame]]s based on the [[Sega]] game franchise ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.&lt;ref name="KSNow"&gt;{{cite web |last=Priestman |first1=Chris |title=Now we can all participate in the kitschy nightmares of Sonic fan art |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/participate-kitschy-nightmares-sonic-fan-art/ |website=[[Kill Screen]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EngadgetTribute" /&gt; Though unofficial, the minigames are presented as real, unfinished ''Sonic'' games for the [[Dreamcast]] developed by MJSTUDIO, a nonexistent [[Sega development studios|Sega development studio]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DestructoidSucked" /&gt; They are listed in the order they are said to have been developed in, with a fictional development history provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=Title screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Make My Sonic''''' is a [[character creation|character creator]] in which the player alters the appearance of a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] model. The player can change his coloration and alter the size and positioning of his limbs.

* '''''Eggman Origin''''' is a vestigial [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; alleged to have been created in 1997.&lt;ref name="PolyGHack" /&gt; It is initially displayed as unplayable beyond the title screen, as it requests a connection to SegaNet.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; However, by opening a separate file in the game's directory folders (Seganet[[.exe]]) and using ''Make My Sonic'' to create an avatar and "upload it to SegaNet", the player will be able to access an untextured map populated by several bipedal, egg-shaped creatures and [[Doctor Eggman]]. By feeding Eggman with worms dug up from around him on the map, he grows. After this, the player completes the game and ascends into the sky, with the number of ascensions posted on the online [[high score|leaderboard]] ''chao.garden''.&lt;ref name="PolyGHack" /&gt;
* '''''Sonic Movie Maker''''' is an [[adventure game]] in which the player is tasked with finding a camera and filming a six-second film to proceed to the following scene. The areas in which the player films are populated by [[ragdoll physics|ragdoll]] models of Sonic and other characters such as [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], [[Rouge the Bat|Rouge]], or [[Blaze the Cat|Blaze]], as well as objects such as pull cords, speech bubble [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Rings|rings]]. [[Level (video gaming)|Level]]s in ''Sonic Movie Maker'' include a garage, a prom dance floor, and a hospital room.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; The game states ''Sonic Movie Maker'' would have been a technological achievement but was canceled in 1998 when Sega management discovered its dark and sexual content. Similar to ''Make My Sonic'', videos the player makes can be uploaded to Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=''Sonic Movie Maker''|quote=Internal notes suggest that SEGA executives pulled the plug after learning about some of Sonic Movie Maker's darker subplots.

* '''''My Roommate Sonic''''' is a [[virtual reality]] (VR) game presented from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] view. The player sits on a couch next to Sonic, with Eggman encouraging the player by [[text message]] to pursue a romantic interest in him. The minigame is also compatible with the [[Oculus Rift]] VR headset.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyGConfess" /&gt; The game suggests ''My Roommate Sonic'' was canceled in 1999 because it was supposed to be used with the unreleased [[Sega VR]] headset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=''My Roommate Sonic''|quote=My Roommate Sonic was a flawless first step into Virtual Reality.

The [[Becontree]] estate was the largest public housing project in the world when it was completed in the mid-1930s. Recognising the need for education but with no responsibility to provide it, the London County Council transferred 24 acres on the western edge of the estate to Essex County Council, who built a technical college (the South East Essex Technical College) and a secondary school (South East Essex County Technical High School) on the site.&lt;ref name=LSIS3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet3UELBarkingcampus.pdf | publisher=London Borough of Barking and Dagenham | title=Local Studies Information Sheet No.3 THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST LONDON (UEL)BARKING CAMPUS | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405151148/http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet3UELBarkingcampus.pdf | archivedate=2012-04-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The College opened in 1936,&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAA9olZqPSMC&amp;pg=PA42 | page=42 | title=The London Encyclopedia | first1=Christopher | last1= Hibbert | authorlink1 = Christopher Hibbert|first2=Ben | last2=Weinreb | |authorlink2 = Ben Weinreb|first3=John | last3=Keay |authorlink3 = John Keay| first4= Julia | last4=Keay | first5=Matthew | last5=Weinreb | edition=3 | publisher = Pan Macmillan | year= 2009 | isbn=978-1-4050-4925-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a building designed by J.Stuart.&lt;ref name=LE /&gt;

The agent for the sellers, being the University of East London, was Graham Bridgeman-Clarke of Bridgeman Clarke Chartered Surveyors, who coincidently was a former pupil.

'''Talking animals''' are a common theme in [[mythology]] and [[Folklore|folk tales]], as well as [[children's literature]]. Fictional talking animals often are [[anthropomorphic]], possessing human-like qualities but appearing as a creature. The usage of talking animals enable storytellers to combine the basic characteristics of the animal with human behavior, to apply metaphor, and to entertain children.

There are a number of alleged real-life [[talking animal]]s.

== Talking creatures which are still creatures ==

The creature retains its original form without much change, other than being able to speak. Sometimes it may only speak as a narration for the reader's convenience. The rabbits in ''[[Watership Down]]'' who, except for the ability to discuss their actions, behave exactly as normal rabbits, also come under this category, as do characters from animated films like ''[[Happy Feet (film)|Happy Feet]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]''.

[[File:Oz Billina byKoehne.jpg|right|thumb|Billina, a talking chicken in Oz, by [[André Koehne]]]]

The talking creature concept is featured within much traditional literature, such as in [[Aesop's Fables]], and several mythologies, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Vedic mythology|Indian]] mythologies. A notable example from the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition is the talking [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] from the [[Book of Genesis]], which tempts [[Eve]] to eat the forbidden fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s include apparent talking creatures that prove to be [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] people, or even [[ghost]]s.  The fairy tales ''[[How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon]]'' and ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'' have the hero aided by a fox and a wolf respectively, but in the similar tale ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking fox is freed from a spell to become the heroine's brother, and in ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'', the fox leaves the hero after explaining that it was the [[Grateful dead (folklore)|dead man]] whose debts the hero had paid.

Whether shape-shifted or merely having the magical ability to speak, the talking creature is perhaps the most common trait of [[fairy tale]]s.  The motif is certainly present in many more tales than fairies.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angelos London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous modern [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories intermix human and creature characters.  In [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[Land of Oz]], creatures (such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger) talk.  The chicken Billina gains the ability to talk when she is swept away by a storm to land near Oz, as do other animals, and Toto, it is explained in a [[retcon]], always had the ability since arriving in Oz, but never used it. In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the world of Narnia is ruled by a talking lion by the name of [[Aslan]], and many small characters are talking woodland animals, both of which interact with both the humans of Narnia, and the children who act as the protagonists of the books.

== Creatures that portray humans ==

Most people in the industries of [[professional]] [[illustration]], [[cartoon]]ing, and [[animation]] refer to these types of creature characters as '''talking animals''',&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Orban, ''Ethical Diversions: The Post-Holocaust Narratives of Pynchon, Abish, DeLillo, and Spiegelman'', New York, London: Routledge, 2005, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[funny animal]]s''' or '''anthropomorphic characters'''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker (ed.), ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the mainstream news media and members of [[furry fandom]] more commonly refer to this variety of talking animals as '''furries'''. The earliest example of talking creatures portraying humans, as opposed to talking creatures portraying creatures, was in [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (''Fables of Bidpai''), which was set in a world of talking creatures who represent human morals and behavior. A good [[Western World|Western]] example of the genre is [[Henryson]]'s ''[[Fabillis]]''. The webcomic "Anima: Age of the Robots" ([[Anima (webcomic)]]) uses anthropomorphism to portray an alternate world as modern as ours, but inhabited by creature-lookalikes. The intelligent robots they have made rebel and threaten the creatures. This serves as a warning to mankind's thoughtless pursuit of technological advancement.

'''The Artists' Studio''' was founded by [[David Young (musical director)|David]] and [[Joellyn Young]] in January 2003 as an independent for-profit [[community theatre]]. The couple each have experience on Broadway with David being a musical director and voice teacher who has traveled with Broadway shows such as [[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]], [[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]], and [[The Music Man]]&lt;ref&gt;page 16, David and Joellyn information https://orchard.org/data/files/Gallery/SummerDocs/Summer_Catalog_online.pdf Orchard School Summer Catalog&lt;/ref&gt; while Joellyn has most notably been Eva Perón in [[Evita (musical)|Evita]].&lt;ref&gt;David and Joellyn Young Staff Profile http://www.artists-studio.com/staff.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre, located in [[Fishers, Indiana]] is primitively based as it was renovated from a [[night club]]&lt;ref&gt;Night club source, interviews with Joellyn Young&lt;/ref&gt; and a stage was added. Despite being in Fishers, [[Noblesville, Indiana|Noblesville]] considers The Artists' Studio to be one of its own places of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Noblesville Places of Interest http://www.debcastino.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID=997799&amp;NF=1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306212328/http://www.debcastino.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID%3D997799%26NF%3D1 |date=2005-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proscenium stage]] is made of classic design and allows for a variety of different trims to be placed around as well as the movement of the back wall, though there is no [[fly tower|fly space]]. The remaining space allows for a 220-seat [[Auditorium|house]] complete with [[sound design|sound]] and [[Stage lighting|lighting systems]], [[office|office space]], and [[classroom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Seating capacity, interview, same as source #2&lt;/ref&gt; Cast, crew, and various other members are volunteers with few employed within the productions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Volunteer Request http://www.artists-studio.com/volunteers.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The First Years===
The seasons of The Artists' Studio have thus far consisted of 8 shows, including a holiday show, and for the first several years, a "young artists production" for aspiring actors and actresses ages 13–25. Of the several years the young artists' production took place, the first and last were [[Grease (musical)|Grease]]. The seasons normally end at the start of summer, picking up again shortly after. Sometime in the summer, the theatre holds General [[Audition (performing arts)|Auditions]],&lt;ref&gt;The Artists' Studio announces 2006-2007. . . (and Gen. Auditions) {{cite web |url=http://www.indianaauditions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2651 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007014749/http://www.indianaauditions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2651 |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }} Indiana Auditions.com&lt;/ref&gt; that is, auditions for the entire season, though each show normally gets its own as well. Audition notices tend to get notoriety in many papers, such as the [[Indianapolis Star]].&lt;ref&gt;Auditions for Little Mermaid * http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070217/LOCAL/702170317/1177/CUSTOMPUB21 Indystar.com&lt;/ref&gt; Several shows became traditional over the years, primarily due to popularity, and The Artists' Studio began to further embrace them. The two major influencing shows within the Artists' Studio's early years were in stark contrast to each other. Each of the two was actually closely linked to different [[holidays]], as Annie was traditionally used as a [[Christmas]] show and The Rocky Horror Show was used around [[Halloween]], usually boasting a midnight performance on or around Halloween itself.

====Annie and The Rocky Horror Show====
[[The Rocky Horror Show]] was arguably the first big hit for the theatre, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter being played by Brent Marty.&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Horror review by http://dev.nuvo.net/articles/article_1576/{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}
 Nuvo Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky Horror was the first of the two prominently recurring shows&lt;ref&gt;The return of Rocky in a student paper http://www.mill-stream.org/pages/features/rockyhorror.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}
 Mill Stream&lt;/ref&gt; in the theatre's early lifetime having been held three times in four years (though it would continue to emerge in later seasons), with a season going by between the second and third incarnations. The first incarnation The Rocky Horror Show at The Artists' Studio was considered one of the best shows of 2003 in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Nuvo Magazine announces the second incarnation, and calls the first one of the best of 2003 http://nuvo.net/articles/article_3222/{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Nuvo Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie (musical)|Annie]] was used as the annual Holiday show until 2006, though it would periodically return in later years. [[Daddy Warbucks]], the lead male character of Annie, was played by Jay Meisenhelder&lt;ref&gt;Cast List for Annie http://www.artists-studio.com/Aarchive.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt; for several incarnations until he was not taken back as a result of controversy stemming from the show itself.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Meisenhelder controversy ''When No Means No'' http://www.takingdownwords.com/taking_down_words/2005/04/when_no_mean_no.html Taking Down Words.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More on Jay Meisenhelder controversy, offers link to outdated Indianapolis Star article {{cite web |url=http://www.worthyboards.com/lofiversion/index.php/t20464.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024256/http://www.worthyboards.com/lofiversion/index.php/t20464.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} Worthy Boards.com&lt;/ref&gt; Annie was the first show at The Artists' Studio to have 2 casts, a Cast A and B, though it was only for the children involved in the show. This became common practice for all the later productions of Annie and set the precedent for future shows requiring a children's cast.

===Shift into Family Theatre===
Annie sold better as a whole than any previous production, despite the first Halloween showing of Rocky Horror marking the first show to [[sell out]]. After Annie continued as a success for several years, the theatre began casting more and more children in shows that required a children's cast. This included adding more children into shows that didn't necessarily ask for them, such as being urchins in [[Aladdin]], a [[Disney]] production that did not necessarily call for children actors.&lt;ref&gt;Cast List for Aladdin http://www.artists-studio.com/Alarchive.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt; Soon shows requiring far more children, and several casts of children began to be commonplace at The Artists' Studio. Shows involving many children, such as &lt;!---Unsure which version---&gt;[[The Wizard of Oz (musical)|Wizard of Oz]]&lt;!---Unsure which version---&gt;, [[Oliver!|Oliver]], [[Seussical]], [[The Music Man]],&lt;ref&gt;The Music Man at TAS * {{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltoncountycalendar.com/index.asp?month=2&amp;day=2&amp;year=2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210182036/http://www.hamiltoncountycalendar.com/index.asp?month=2&amp;day=2&amp;year=2007 |archivedate=2007-02-10 |df= }} Hamilton County Calendar&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]],&lt;ref&gt;''People and Song fill 'Joseph' stage'' http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007701200362 IndyStar.com&lt;/ref&gt; became popular starting in the 2004-2005 season and the trend continued onward into many later seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artists-studio.com/2007-08season.htm @007-2008 Season]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Artists' Studio Kids====
In addition to classes and camps, The Artists' Studio began producing shows exclusively for kids, beginning with ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' in November 2007, continuing on with ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in the spring, and many other productions from thereon. Performance in these productions has cost upward of $100 for the interested children, something unique of mainstage productions and other theatres in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artists-studio.com/Summer%20Camp.htm Summer Camp Registration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond the Stage==
The Artists' Studio is especially unique in that it acts as much more than just a performing theatre. It also offers a wide variety of classes in [[dance|dancing]], [[acting]] and [[singing]]. It also hosts other unique services, such as hosting themed children's [[party#Birthday party|birthday parties]]. The extra services are likely more a reflection on the fact that, unlike most [[community theatre]]s in Indiana, The Artists' Studio is a for-profit organization. This has kept the [[Encore Association]], which provides an award ceremony for community theatres in Indiana, from recognizing any of The Artists' Studios productions, as one of the stipulations is that no one be paid in a nominated production; it must be produced by a not-for-profit theatre group.&lt;ref&gt;Who is missing from the [Encore Award] nominations...

[[File:Lepeletier-David 1.JPG|thumb|Engraving after David's painting]]
'''''The Last Moments of Michel Lepeletier''''', '''''The Death of Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau''''' or '''''Lepeletier on his Deathbed''''' was a 1793 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]].

Now lost, it showed député [[Louis-Michel Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau]] on his deathbed following his assassination for voting in favour of the [[execution of Louis XVI]] and formed a [[diptych]] with ''[[The Death of Marat]]'' for the meeting hall of the [[National Convention (France)|National Convention]]. Those two paintings and ''[[The Death of Young Bara]]'' formed a series devoted to martyrs of the [[French Revolution]].

It was removed in 1795 and entrusted to the artist, who still owned it on his death in Brussels. It was then sold by his family to the subject's daughter Louise Suzanne de Mortefontaine. After that sale it disappeared and most probably Louise destroyed it and as many engravings after it as possible in order to erase any trace of her father's part in the Revolution. It is only known through a drawing by Anatole Desvosge and an engraving by Tardieu which partially escaped destruction.

'''''The North-West Passage''''' is an 1874 painting by [[John Everett Millais]]. It depicts an elderly sailor sitting at a desk, with his daughter seated in a stool beside him. He stares out at the viewer, while she reads from a log-book. On the desk is a large chart depicting complex passageways between incompletely charted islands. 

Millais exhibited the painting with the subtitle '''"It might be done and England should do it"''', a line imagined to be spoken by the aged sailor.  The title and subtitle refer to the repeated failure of British expeditions to find the [[northwest passage]], a navigable passageway around the north of the American continent. These expeditions "became synonymous with failure, adversity and death, with men and ships battling against hopeless odds in a frozen wilderness."&lt;ref name = tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-the-north-west-passage-n01509 Tate Gallery, The North-West Passage 1874]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The search for the northwest passage had been undertaken repeatedly since the voyages of [[Henry Hudson]] in the early 17th century. The most significant attempt was the 1845 expedition led by [[John Franklin]], which had disappeared, apparently without trace. Subsequent expeditions had found evidence that Franklin's two ships had become stuck in ice, and that the crews had died over a number of years from various causes, some having made unsuccessful attempts to escape across the ice. These later expeditions were also unable to navigate a route between Canada and the Arctic. Millais had the idea for the painting when a new expedition to explore the passage, the [[British Arctic Expedition]] led by [[George Nares]], was being prepared.&lt;ref name = tate/&gt;&lt;ref name = nar&gt;James, Ian, "'The North-West Passage' by Sir John Millais", ''Polar Record'', January 1986; 23 (142), pp. 81-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Millais was keen to use [[Edward John Trelawny]] as the model for the figure of his old sailor. He had met him at the funeral of their mutual friend [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]. Millais' wife [[Effie Gray]] persuaded Trelawny to sit for the picture by agreeing to attend a Turkish bath he was promoting at the time. The female figure was a professional model, Mrs Ellis, who was later used in another painting, ''Stitch, Stitch, Stitch'' (1876). The right side of the painting originally depicted two of the sailor's grandchildren, who were modelled by John and Alice Millais, two of Millais' own children. They were shown looking at a globe of the world. But after Millais completed the painting, he became unhappy with the figures of the children, thinking that they distracted the eye from the main figure. He cut out this section of the painting and replaced it with a screen, over which British naval flags are hung.&lt;ref name = "guille"&gt;Millais, John Guille, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', 1898, pp. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart depicted in the painting is of the northern coast of Canada, as mapped during the [[Robert McClure]] expeditions of 1848-53. It was designed by [[Edward Augustus Inglefield]] and printed in 1854.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; Millais may have intended to suggest that the old man was a veteran of one of McClure's expeditions. The painting in the background depicting an ice-trapped ship (partly hidden by the flag) resembles images of McClure's ship [[HMS Investigator (1848)|HMS ''Investigator'']], which was abandoned by McClure and his crew in 1853 after three years of being trapped.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; 

When he saw the painting at the Royal Academy exhibition, Trelawny, who was teetotal, was outraged by the fact that Millais had included a glass of [[grog]] and a lemon. According to Millais' son [[John Guille Millais]], he complained to his friends in the Albany Club that "that fellow Millais has handed me down to posterity with a glass of rum-and-water in one hand and a lemon in the other". However, he eventually decided that Millais' Scottish wife Effie was probably to blame because "the Scotch are a nation of sots".&lt;ref name = "guille2"&gt;Millais, John Guille, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', 1898, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and provenance==
The painting was first shown at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1874, at which it was highly praised by the art critics of the day.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; It was then shown at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1876. The painting was acquired by [[Henry Bolckow]] of Marton Hall, Middlesbrough for £4,930, from whose estate it was later bought by [[Henry Tate]] in 1888, who subsequently donated it to the National Gallery of British Art he had founded, later named after him as the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; When Tate bought the painting for 4,000 guineas there was apparently a "huge cheer" because it meant that it would form part of the national collection which Tate was planning.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Charles Robinson Carter, ''Let Me Tell You'', Hutchinson &amp; Company, 1940, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Heartbreak House, act 2 (Shotover &amp; Ellie).jpg|thumb|Albert Perry as Shotover and Elizabeth Risdon as Ellie Dunn in the original 1920 production of ''Heartbreak House'']]
The painting was hugely successful at the time, and was very widely circulated in reproductions. Millais' son says he once saw a reproduction in "the hut of a Hottentot shepherd" in South Africa.&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; Along with Millais' earlier painting ''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' it came to symbolise Britain's self-image as a nation of heroic explorers and empire-builders.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; Millais received a letter from the explorer Sir George Nares in which he said that the painting had had a powerful effect on the spirit of the nation.&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; 

The painting was quickly referenced in cartoons. In October 1874 ''[[Punch, or the London Charivari|Punch]]'' published a pastiche by [[John Tenniel]] portraying Disraeli as the old sailor and Britannia in the position of his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Tenniel, John, engraved by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]], ''Punch, or the London Charivari'', December 5, 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1915 cartoon by [[Joseph Morewood Staniforth]] entitled "The Dardanelles Passage" was captioned "it might be done and England and France can do it", referring to the [[Gallipoli campaign]], which was then just beginning. [[John Bull]] and [[Marianne]] replaced the old sailor and his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Dardanelles Passage", ''Western Mail'', 27 February 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] was inspired by the doleful imagery of failure and frustration in the work when he came to write his play ''[[Heartbreak House]]'', which emphasises the pathos and impotence of its characters. The relationship between the main characters, Captain Shotover and Ellie Dunn, was based on the figures in the painting, and one scene partially reproduces the composition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Bernard Shaw on the London art scene, 1885-1950'', Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In his last completed play, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', Shaw depicts the same scene mimicking Millais' painting.&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Bertolini, ''Shaw and Other Playwrights'', Penn State Press, 1993, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28th June 1919'']]

'''''The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by Irish artist [[William Orpen]], completed in 1919. It was one the paintings commissioned from Orpen to commemorate of the [[Versailles Peace Conference|Peace Conference]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1919.  The work is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.

==Background==
Orpen was one of the first people chosen as a [[war artist]] by the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in 1917.  Orpen was also official painter at the peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the proceedings.  The work was the most expensive of the British public art commissions associated with the First World War: Orpen was paid £3,000: by comparison, [[John Singer Sargent]] received £300 for his much larger painting ''[[Gassed (painting)|Gassed]]''.

The painting depicts the signature of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] by representatives from Germany on 28 June 1919, to formally end the [[First World War]].  It is a [[group portrait]] depicting soldiers, diplomats and politicians who attended the conference, at the point when the treaty was signed in the opulent surroundings of [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Hall of Mirrors]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. High up can be seen the words "Le Roy Gouverne par lui meme" (French: "The King governs alone").  It measures {{convert|152.4|xx|127|cm|in}}.

Orpen grew to dislike the politicians at the conference, considering them vain and greedy.  In his painting, they are dwarfed by the scale of the palace.

==History==

In the early 2000s, filmmaker Manon Barbeau shot a feature-length film with 15 [[Atikamekw]] youths from the [[Wemotaci, Quebec|Wemotaci]] community in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informactionfilms.com/fr/realisateurs/manon-barbeau.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/who-are-we/history&lt;/ref&gt; Wapikoni is named after one of Barbeau’s collaborators on the project, a young woman named Wapikoni Awashish, who died in a car crash at the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/who-are-we/history&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Barbeau launched the first of the mobile studios that the organization operates today.&lt;ref&gt;http://gestion.evalorix.com/cas/leadership-et-comportement-organisationnel/manon-barbeau-le-lien-lautre/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each mobile studio is an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] equipped with an editing station, a small [[Recording studio|sound studio]], a projection and screening area, desktops with [[Final Cut Pro]], and HD cameras and microphones to film with.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Montreal+Diary+Wapikoni+mobile+offers+creative+outlet/7455199/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has been credited with providing Aboriginal youth an outlet for expressing themselves, as well as the tools and skills to do so.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Montreal+Diary+Wapikoni+mobile+offers+creative+outlet/7455199/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/Content/documents/Revuedepresse/The_Gazette_SOSWapikoni_26_juillet_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At each stop, a group of participants is welcomed by mentor-filmmakers, youth workers, local assistant-trainers and a local coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/team/our-field-team&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/who-are-we/innovative-approach&lt;/ref&gt; The month-long workshops focus on [[Documentary film|documentary]] filmmaking and musical recording, offering participants training in writing and [[Film director|directing]], along with other behind the scenes work such as [[Camera operator|filming]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]], and [[Film editing|editing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/who-are-we/wapikoni-in-brief&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/who-are-we/innovative-approach&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Wapikoni has two permanent studios: one each in the [[Kitcisakik, Quebec|Kitcisakik]] and the [[Wemotaci, Quebec|Wemotaci]] First Nations communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/Content/documents/Revuedepresse/The%20Gazette_20121028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it hosted an international symposium with the goal of creating RICAA (Réseau International de Création Audiovisuelle Autochtone), a network of Aboriginal production companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdc-ccd.org/Symposium-international-sur-la?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ledevoir.com/culture/cinema/421196/le-festival-du-nouveau-cinema-souligne-le-10e-anniversaire-de-wapikoni-mobile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressegauche.org/spip.php?article18324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/actualites/nouvelles/quand-le-cinema-cree-des-ponts&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable participant from the project’s inaugural year was [[Samian (rapper)|Samian]], an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] rapper from [[Pikogan, Quebec|Pikogan]] in [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]], who is now a Wapikoni spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/about/team/our-spokesperson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapikoni.ca/Content/documents/Revuedepresse/TheGazette_Samian_20110505.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other Wapikoni participants have gone on to work at [[Telefilm Canada]] as well as [[the CBC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/327648/cinema-ottawa-porte-un-coup-aux-jeunes-createurs-autochtones&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Water Willow''''' is an 1871 oil painting by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].  It depicts [[Jane Morris]] in the river landscape near [[Kelmscott Manor]], with the manor in the left background and Kelmscott Church below the hill to the right.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti Study for Water Willow.jpg|left|thumb|Chalk study for ''Water Willow''.  [[Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery]].]]
In May 1871, [[William Morris]] rented Kelmscott Manor, a 17th-century limestone manor house along the [[Thames]] near [[Kelmscott]] in [[Oxfordshire]], to be a summer escape from London.  Rossetti shared the lease, but the house soon became a retreat for Rossetti and Morris's wife Jane to have a long-lasting and complicated liaison. The two spent an idyllic summer there, with the Morris children, in 1871, while Morris himself travelled to [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), pp. 123–130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rossetti made a version of ''Water Willow'' in coloured chalks at Kelmscott, and then painted the small oil "to fit a beautiful old frame I have"&lt;ref name="Treuherz"&gt;Treuherz (2003), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the chalk study, Jane holds a [[Viola tricolor|pansy]], symbol of love and remembrance, rather than the willow branches, a symbol of sorrow and longing, of the final painting.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

In 1877, facing financial difficulties, Rossetti sold the painting to "a new buyer", William Alfred Turner (1839–1886),  a Manchester cotton spinner, who also purchased ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'' at that time.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (2004), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossetti apologized to Jane Morris for selling the work, saying he was "really mortally sorry to part with the Kelmscott picture" but "felt there was no alternative".&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

==Provenance and exhibitions==
After Turner's death, the painting was sold at auction by [[Christie's]] on 28 April 1888 and was bought in by his executors.  ''Water Willow'' was the first [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painting acquired by the American collector [[Samuel Bancroft]], who purchased it in 1890.  Bancroft later sent the painting back to England to be repaired by [[Charles Fairfax Murray]]. Murray asked and received Bancroft's permission to make a copy that he gave to Jane Morris, because "she was to have had the picture, it being a great favourite of hers."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wildman, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The original was bequeathed to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] by Bancroft's descendants in 1935.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

The painting was exhibited in Manchester in 1882 and again in 1887, London in 1883, and Philadelphia in 1892.
It was also exhibited in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1917 and 1934, [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1976, and Liverpool and Amsterdam in 2003.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;
