[[File:Roman remains in 39 Bridge Street, Chester (3).JPG|thumb|right|Part of the Roman remains in the cellar]]

'''39 Bridge Street''' is a building in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]], its major archaeological feature being the remains of a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[hypocaust]] in its cellar.&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376085|desc= 39&amp;nbsp;Bridge Street, Chester|accessdate= 6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has four storeys, with a shop at street level and a portion of [[Chester Rows]] in the storey above.  The hypocaust in the cellar dates to the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century during the Roman occupation of Chester.  In the late 13th&amp;nbsp;or early 14th&amp;nbsp;century a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]] was built adjacent to the hypocaust, with a house above.  In 1864 a new floor was inserted at street level and a shop front was added in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  The ground floor is now used as a café.  The remains of the hypocaust were found during the reconstruction of the property in 1864.  They consist of 27&amp;nbsp;square columns in a rectangular chamber which originally contained 32&amp;nbsp;columns in eight rows of four.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of [[A Course in Miracles]]''''' (1992) is the first book by author [[Marianne Williamson]] and a [[The New York Times Best Sellers List|''New York Times'' Best seller]].

==Exposure==
''A Return to Love'' spent 39 weeks on the New York Times best sellers list in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BEST SELLERS: November 29, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/books/best-sellers-november-29-1992.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 1992|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, ''A Return to Love'' was credited as being one of the two books that helped bring [[New Age]] perspectives to the American mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA319870.html?pubdate=9%2F1%2F2003&amp;display=archive ''Publisher's Weekly'' September 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years after her first appearance with the book, Williamson was interviewed again by Oprah Winfrey in July 2012, this time in a ''[[Super Soul Sunday]]'' (OWN TV) episode titled, "20 Years After A Return to Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Oprah and Marianne Williamson: 20 Years After A Return to Love |publisher=OWN TV, Super Soul Sunday | url = http://www.oprah.com/own-super-soul-sunday/Full-Episode-Oprah-and-Marianne-Williamson-Video |date=July 29, 2012|accessdate = 2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]], of ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', writes, "Williamson might be called Oprah's patron saint. She's all about love and healing, yin and yang, being wounded, and using love and prayer to heal all wounds. ''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course In Miracles'' (1992) was number one on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' non-fiction best-sellers list for 11 weeks. Williamson promoted her book and ACIM when she appeared on the ''Oprah Winfrey Show'', an episode that received more pro viewer mail than any other show for 1992. She also spoke of the book, and the course when she was interviewed by [[Barbara Walters]] on the ABC television news show [[20/20 (US television series)|''20/20'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/cim.html#*** ''Skeptics Dictionary'' ACIM listing] Retrieved June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu al-Wafa' al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik''' ({{lang-ar|ابو الوافاء المبشّر بن فاتك}} {{transl|ar|Abū al-Wafā’ Al-Mubaššir ibn Fātik}}) was a scholar well versed in the mathematical sciences and also wrote  on logic and medicine. He was born in [[Damascus]] but lived mainly in Egypt during the 11th century [[Fatimid]] Caliphate. He also wrote an historical chronicle of the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. However, the book he is famed for and the only one extant, ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim]]'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the "Selected Maxims and Aphorisms", is a collection of sayings attributed to the ancient sages (mainly Greeks) translated into Arabic.  The date of composition given by the author is 1048–1049.

==Biography==
The biographical details we have come from [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]]'s ''Uyūn ul-Anbāʾ fī Ṭabaqāt ul-Aṭibbāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|عيون الأنباء في طبقات الأطباء}}, "the History of Physicians"). According to Usaibia, Ibn Fatik was from a noble family and held the position of "[[emir]]" at the court of the [[Fatimids]] in the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. He was a passionate [[bibliophile]], acquired a great collection of books and enjoyed the company of scholars, and above all, he devoted himself to study. He trained in mathematics and astronomy under the philosopher, mathematician and astronomer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (965-1040).  He also associated with Ibn al-Amidi and the physician, astrologer, and astronomer [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (988–1061). When he died, many heads of state attended his funeral. According to this biography, such was his wife's disaffection through want of attention, she threw most of his books into the pool at the center of the house, and so they were lost by drowning.

==Works==
{{anchor|al-Mukhtar}} ''Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the “Book of Selected Maxims and Aphorisms”, can be described as a collection of biographies of twenty-one "sages", mainly Greeks (e.g. [[Seth]], ([[Zedekiah]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish translation has "Sedechias" in place of Seth here. (See ''Bocados de Oro'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]], [[Homer]], [[Solon]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Diogenes]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Alexander the Great]]), accompanied by the maxims and sayings attributed to them.  The biographies are largely legendary and most attributions highly dubious.

==Influences==
His ''al-Mukhtar'' was a great success in the centuries that followed, first in the Arab-Muslim world where it provided source material for later scholars, such as for Muhammad [[al-Shahrastani]] in his book ''Kitab al-wa-l-Milal Nihal'' and Shams [[al-Din al-Shahrazuri]] for his ''[[Nuzhat al-Arwah]]''.

==Translations==
; Spanish:
*''Los Bocados de Oro''; translated in the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1252–1284) was the earliest translation into a Western European vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;This primitive text (existing in isolation in several manuscripts) was notably integrated in the story of the journey of "Bonium of King of Persia" went to India to find wisdom and which he write down in ''Las Los Palabras Sabios Philosophers''. Text printed in Seville in 1495, in Salamanca in 1499, in Toledo in 1502 and 1510, Valencia in 1522, and in Valladolid in 1527.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Latin:
*''Liber Philosophorum Moralium Antiquorum'' by the Italian [[John of Procida]] († 1298), friend and doctor of [[Emperor Frederick II]].  Several early Latin translations appeared as  [[florilegia]] and excerpts integrated into larger works.
; French:
*''Les Dits Moraulx des Philosophes'' by {{ill|Guillaume de Tignonville|fr}}, chamberlain to [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI]]; [[Middle French]] from the Latin translation. Of the fifty manuscripts extant the oldest dates from 1402. The first printed editions were made in [[Bruges]] by [[Colard Mansion]] (no date, perhaps 1477), in Paris by [[Antoine Vérard]] in 1486, by [[Jean Trepperel]] in 1502, by [[Galliot du Pré]] in 1531, etc. (Nine reported editions by 1533).
; Occitan:
*''Los Dichs dels Philosophes'' from the Tignonville's French translation.
; English:
*''[[The Dicts or Sayings of the Philosophers]]'' (1450) by [[Stephen Scrope]] for his stepfather, [[John Fastolf]]; [[Middle English]] translation.&lt;ref&gt;Ms. BL Harley 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dicts and Sayings of the Philosophers''; transl. Stephen Scrope, William Worcester and an anonymous translator; ed. Curt F. Bühler (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophhres]]'' (1473) by [[Anthony Woodville]].&lt;ref&gt;Translation performed after a book containing the text Tignonville lent by a traveling companion, Louis Bretaylles.&lt;/ref&gt; William Worcester amended Woodville's translation and it appears this was the version printed by [[William Caxton]] in his Westminster workshop on November 18, 1477, the first book printed in England, that is discounting [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s [[Apostles' Creed]], (''Expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum'') printed December 17, 1468.

[[Art theft]] and [[looted art|looting]] occurred on a massive scale during [[World War II]]. It originated with the policies of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries, primarily [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Japan]], which systematically looted occupied territories. Near the end of the war the [[Soviet Union]], in turn, began looting reclaimed and occupied territories. "The grand scale of looted artwork by the Nazis has resulted in the loss of many pieces being scattered across the world." (Minyard, 2007)

Although the looting of "cultural heritage" of the German people and private collectors was not permitted in the 1945 agreement of Yalta, following the defeat of Germany by the Allied forces the following goods disappeared: three truckloads of precious art, which was listed in a confiscated list by the US forces (in the mine Merker in Thuringia), and one trainload of 20 wagons loaded with artwork and jewels from Hungary (named the "gold train").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to a 2001 ''Der Spiegel'' article,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} the artwork is suspected to be in the US and has never been officially declared. The lost artworks from the "Grube Merker," about 450 pictures, are not found in any museum and thought to have been sold privately.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An attempt by the US to confiscate more German art by requesting 202 precious pictures to be taken was prevented by [[Walter Farmer]] on 6 November 1945, an art protection officer in Wiesbaden leading the central art collection store.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Although against his direct orders from the US, he assembled 24 colleagues from Germany and Austria and successfully prevented the removal of the pictures (named as operation "Westward Ho").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19438032.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Before his death in 1997, Farmer was awarded Germany's highest civilian honor, the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit, for his work in returning the 202 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Walter Farmer. The Economist; London Vol. 344, Iss. 8031, Anonymous (Aug 23, 1997): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Art as Politics in the Third Reich'' by [[Jonathan Petropoulos|Jonathan Petropoulus]] he outlines how there is a need for further cooperation by smaller art galleries to recover art that they may be holding and not know who it belongs to. He says that there are still many tens of thousands of pieces of art missing today, but there is still more research to be done to get a more accurate number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|last=Petropoulos|first=Jonathan|publisher=Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large plan was drafted by the Nazis for much of the stolen art to be featured in a so-called [[Fuhrermuseum|Führermuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism &lt;/ref&gt; which would display much of the art plundered by the Nazis. This museum would feature works that were not considered to be "[[degenerate art]]" and would instead solely focus on the aesthetics that Hitler considered to be "good", and was to be created in the city of [[Linz]]. However, this museum was never created, and much of the art that may have been on display there is still missing today.  The Nazis were so vehemently against the loss of the art that they had plundered for this museum that there was a plan to destroy a stockpile of art saved for the Führermuseum at the [[Altaussee]] salt mines, which held over 12000 pieces of stolen art, using eight 500-kilogram bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edsel |first1=Robert M. |title=The Monuments Men |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Hachette/Center Street |isbn=978-1-59995-149-2 |pages=303-306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless pieces of art were stolen during the Holocaust and many were destroyed.  The Nazis were relentless in their efforts to get rid of the Jewish people and their culture. Paintings that had been passed down from generation to generation were taken and destroyed. This was extremely emotionally hard for many Jewish families because it was not only an attack on their families and culture, but also on their history. There have barely been any efforts of restitution. Many of the families who lost art are simply now left with claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willi|first1=Korte|title=Nazi Looted Art: The Case of the Missing Perspective|journal=First Person Singular|date=September 1, 2006|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary problems encountered by individuals pursuing claims is that it is difficult to locate the necessary documentation on provenance. Organizations with information on a piece's history, museums in particular, often have a disincentive to share information that could assist in an heir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foulkes|first=Lucia|date=2015|title=The art of atonement: how mandated transparency can help return masterpieces lost during World War II|url=|journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ballets Russes''' ({{IPA-fr|balɛ ʁys|lang}}) was an itinerant [[ballet]] company based in Paris that performed between 1909 and 1929 throughout Europe and on tours to North and South America. The company never performed in Russia, where the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] disrupted society. After its initial Paris season, the company had no formal ties there.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1998), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally conceived by [[impresario]] [[Sergei Diaghilev]], the Ballets Russes is widely regarded as the most influential ballet company of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/ART309940 |title=Diaghilev's Golden Age of the Ballets Russes dazzles London with V&amp;A display |publisher=Culture24 |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it promoted ground-breaking artistic collaborations among young choreographers, composers, designers, and dancers, all at the forefront of their several fields. Diaghilev commissioned works from composers such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], artists such as [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Henri Matisse]], and costume designers [[Léon Bakst]] and [[Coco Chanel]].

The company's productions created a huge sensation, &lt;!-- around the world --&gt;completely reinvigorating the art of performing dance, bringing many visual artists to public attention, and significantly affecting the course of musical composition.&lt;!-- Its ballets have been variously interpreted as Classical, Neo-Classical, Romantic, Neo-Romantic, Avant-Garde, Expressionist, Abstract, and Orientalist.--&gt; It also introduced European and American audiences to tales, music, and design motifs drawn from Russian folklore. The influence of the Ballets Russes lasts to the present day.

==Nomenclature==
The French plural form of the name, ''“Ballets Russes,”'' specifically refers to the company founded by Sergei Diaghilev and active during his lifetime.  (In some publicity the company was advertised as ''Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghileff.'')  In English, the company is now commonly referred to as "the Ballets Russes" (plural, without italics), although in the early part of the 20th century, it was sometimes referred to as “The Russian Ballet” or “Diaghilev’s Russian Ballet.”  To add to the confusion, some publicity material spelled the name in the singular&lt;!-- , as in this programme of the company's last season at Covent Garden in 1929--&gt;.

The names “[[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]]” and “The [[Original Ballet Russe]]” (using the singular) refer to companies that formed after Diaghilev's death in 1929.

==History and productions==
[[File:Sergei Diaghilev 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sergei Diaghilev]], founder of the Ballets Russes ]]

=== Background ===
[[Sergei Diaghilev]], the company's [[impresario]] (or "[[artistic director]]" in modern terms), was chiefly responsible for its success. He was uniquely prepared for the role; born into a wealthy Russian family of vodka distillers (though they went bankrupt when he was 18), he was accustomed to moving in the upper-class circles that provided the company's patrons and benefactors.

In 1890, he enrolled at the Faculty of Law, St. Petersburg, to prepare for a career in the civil service like many Russian young men of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt;  There he was introduced (through his cousin [[Dmitry Filosofov]]) to a student clique of artists and intellectuals calling themselves [[Nevsky Pickwickians|The Nevsky Pickwickians]] whose most influential member was [[Alexandre Benois]]; others included [[Léon Bakst]], [[Walter Nouvel]], and [[Konstantin Somov]].&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Although Diaghilev was at first considered to be ... under the tutelage of Benois, he became one of the most savvy critics of Russian art. They believed that "art is free, life is paralyzed."--&gt;From childhood, Diaghilev had been passionately interested in music. However, his ambition to become a composer was dashed in 1894 when [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] told him he had no talent.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;438, n.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, several members of [[Nevsky Pickwickians|The Pickwickians]] founded the journal ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' (''World of Art'') under the editorship of Diaghilev.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1902, ''Mir iskusstva'' included reviews of concerts, operas, and ballets in Russia. The latter were chiefly written by Benois, who exerted considerable influence on Diaghilev's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Simon.  "The 'World of Art' and Music," in ''[Mir Iskusstva]:  Russia's Age of Elegance.'' Palace Editions.  Omaha, Minneapolis, and Princeton, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mir iskusstva'' also sponsored exhibitions of Russian art in St. Petersburg, culminating in Diaghilev's important 1905 show of Russian portraiture at the [[Tauride Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Guroff, Greg.  "Introduction" in ''[Mir Iskusstva]:  Russia's Age of Elegance.'' Palace Editions.  Omaha, Minneapolis, and Princeton, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Macke Russisches Ballett 1.jpg|alt=painting of a ballet performance on stage|thumb|''Ballet Russes'' by [[August Macke]], 1912]]

Frustrated by the extreme conservatism of the Russian art world, Diaghilev organized the groundbreaking ''Exhibition of Russian Art'' at the [[Petit Palais]] in Paris in 1906, the first major showing of Russian art in the West. Its enormous success created a Parisian fascination with all things Russian. Diaghilev organized a 1907 season of Russian music at the [[Paris Opera|Paris Opéra]]. In 1908, Diaghilev returned to the Paris Opéra with six performances of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]],'' starring basso [[Fyodor Chaliapin]]. This was [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s 1908 version (with additional cuts and re-arrangement of the scenes). The performances were a sensation, though the costs of producing grand opera were crippling. 

===Debut===
In 1909, Diaghilev presented his first Paris "Saison Russe" devoted exclusively to ballet (although the company did not use the name "Ballets Russes" until the following year). Most of this original company were resident performers at the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[Saint Petersburg]], hired by Diaghilev to perform in Paris during the Imperial Ballet's summer holidays. The first season's repertory featured a variety of works chiefly choreographed by [[Michel Fokine]], including ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'', the ''[[Polovtsian Dances]]'' (from ''[[Prince Igor]]''), ''[[Les Sylphides]]'', and ''[[Cléopâtre (ballet)|Cléopâtre]]''. The season also included ''Le Festin'', a pastiche set by several choreographers (including Fokine) to music by several Russian composers. 

&lt;!--
===Paris Seasons to 1914===
;1910
The 1910 Ballets Russes season featured the debut of ''[[The Firebird]]'' with music by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], choreography by [[Michel Fokine|Fokine]], stage sets by [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Golovin]], and costumes by Golovin and [[Leon Bakst|Bakst]].  It was the first of Diaghilev's productions whose score was expressly composed for the Ballets Russes, and it made Stravinsky famous overnight.  Other 1910 productions included:  ''Scheherezade'' (choreographed to the symphonic poem by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]); ''Carnaval'' (choreographed by Fokine to the piano work by [[Robert Schumann]], orchestrated by several Russian composers);  [MORE]; and a revival of the classical Russian ballet ''[[Giselle]]'' (choreography by xx).

;1911
The 1911 season is best remembered for [[Igor Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky's]] second commissioned score:  ''[[Petrushka]]'' (with choreography by Fokine, stage sets and costumes by Bakst). Although the ballet received only four performances at the end of the season, it was soon hailed as one of the great collaborations of the early 20th century.  Another sensation was created with ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', to [[Carl Maria von Weber|Carl Maria von Weber's]] ''[[Invitation to the Dance]]'' as orchestrated by [[Hector Berlioz]] (choreography by Fokine, sets and costumes by Bakst).  The work featured the dancing of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Tamara Karsavina]].

When Sergei Diaghilev died of diabetes in Venice on 19 August 1929, the Ballets Russes was left with substantial debts. As the [[Great Depression]] began, its property was claimed by its creditors and the company of dancers dispersed.

In 1931, Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]] (a Russian émigré entrepreneur from Paris) and [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]] (ballet director at the [[Monte Carlo Opera]]) founded the [[Original Ballet Russe|Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], giving its first performances there in 1932.&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;Amanda. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/ballets-russes/2005/07/16/1121455937588.html "Ballets Russes"], ''[[The Age]]'' (17 July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Diaghilev alumni [[Léonide Massine]] and [[George Balanchine]] worked as choreographers with the company and [[Tamara Toumanova]] was a principal dancer.

Artistic differences led to a split between Blum and de Basil,&lt;ref name="Homans"&gt;Homans, Jennifer. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/books/review/book-review-rene-blum-and-the-ballets-russes-by-judith-chazin-bennahum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "René Blum: Life of a Dance Master,"] ''New York Times'' (July 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; after which de Basil renamed his company initially "Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil".&lt;ref name="Answers"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2010-03-28 | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/les-ballets-russes-de-monte-carlo | title=Les Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo | publisher=The Oxford Dictionary of Dance | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum retained the name "Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo", while de Basil created a new company. In 1938, he called it "The Covent Garden Russian Ballet"&lt;ref name="Answers" /&gt; and then renamed it the "[[Original Ballet Russe]]" in 1939.&lt;ref name="Answers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tennant, Victoria|title=Irina Baronova and the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I64bBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=14 June 2016|year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-16716-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] began, the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] left Europe and toured extensively in the United States and South America. As dancers retired and left the company, they often founded dance studios in the United States or South America or taught at other former company dancers' studios.  With Balanchine's founding of the [[School of American Ballet]], and later the [[New York City Ballet]], many outstanding former Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo dancers went to New York to teach in his school. When they toured the United States, [[Cyd Charisse]], the film actress and dancer, was taken into the cast.

The [[Original Ballet Russe]] toured mostly in Europe. Its alumni were influential in teaching classical Russian ballet technique in European schools.

The successor companies were the subject of the 2005 documentary film ''[[Ballets Russes (film)|Ballets Russes]]''.

==The dancers==
[[File:Ballets Russes Apollon 1928.jpg|alt=ballet dancers posing in a montage|thumb|Scene from ''[[Apollon musagète]]'', 1928. Dancers: [[Serge Lifar]], [[Alexandra Danilova|Danilova]], Chernysheva, [[Felia Doubrovska|Dubrovska]], Petrova|left]]
The Ballets Russes was noted for the high standard of its dancers, most of whom had been classically trained at the great Imperial schools in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Their high technical standards contributed a great deal to the company's success in Paris, where dance technique had declined markedly since the 1830s.

Principal female dancers included: [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Tamara Karsavina]], [[Olga Spessivtseva]], [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Ida Rubinstein]], [[Bronislava Nijinska]], [[Lydia Lopokova]], [[Diana Gould (dancer)|Diana Gould]] and [[Alicia Markova]], among others; many earned international renown with the company. Prima ballerina [[Xenia Makletzova]] was dismissed from the company in 1916 and sued by Diaghilev; she countersued for breach of contract, and won $4500 in a Massachusetts court.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Banni-Viñas, [https://doi.org/10.1093/ajlh/53.3.353 "Correcting a Ballerina's Story: The Truth behind Makletzova v. Diaghileff"] ''American Journal of Legal History'' 53(3)(July 2013): 353-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/227/227mass100.html Xenia P. Makletzova v. Sergei Diaghileff], 227 Mass. 100, March 13 1917 — May 25 1917, Suffolk County MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballets Russes was even more remarkable for raising the status of the male dancer, largely ignored by choreographers and ballet audiences since the early 19th century. Among the male dancers were [[Michel Fokine]], [[Serge Lifar]], [[Léonide Massine]], [[Anton Dolin]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Valentin Zeglovsky]], [[Theodore Kosloff]], [[Adolph Bolm]], and the legendary [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], considered the most popular and talented dancer in the company's history.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], in later years, younger dancers were taken from those trained in Paris by former Imperial dancers, within the large community of Russian exiles. Recruits were even accepted from America and included a young [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]] who joined the troupe in Monte Carlo during 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/page_essay_meglin.pdf ''Ruth Page - Early Architect of the American Ballet''  a biographical essay by Joellen A.

==The choreographers==
The company featured and premiered now-famous (and sometimes notorious) works by the great [[choreography|choreographers]] [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Michel Fokine]], as well as new works by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[Bronislava Nijinska]], [[Léonide Massine]], and the young [[George Balanchine]] at the start of his career.

===Michel Fokine===
The choreography of [[Michel Fokine]] was of paramount importance in the initial success of the Ballets Russes.  Fokine had graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1898, and eventually become First Soloist at the [[Mariinsky Theater]].  In 1907, Fokine choreographed his first work for the Imperial Russian Ballet, ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]''. In the same year, he created ''Chopiniana'' to piano music by the composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] as orchestrated by [[Alexander Glazunov]]. This was an early example of creating choreography to an existing score rather than to music specifically written for the ballet, a departure from the normal practice at the time.

Fokine established an international reputation with his works choreographed during the first four seasons (1909–1912) of the Ballets Russes. These included the ''[[Polovtsian Dances]]'' (from ''[[Prince Igor]]''), ''Le Pavillon d'Armide'' (a revival of his 1907 production for the Imperial Russian Ballet), ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' (a reworking of his earlier ''Chopiniana''), ''[[The Firebird]]'', ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', ''[[Petrushka]]'', and ''[[Daphnis and Chloé]]'' . After a longstanding tumultuous relationship with Diaghilev, Fokine left the Ballets Russes at the end of the 1912 season.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaslav Nijinsky===
[[File:Nijinsky in Scheherazade2.jpg|thumb|Vaslav Nijinsky in ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''

|315x315px]]&lt;!--Nijinsky's performance with Tamara Karsavina in the "Bluebird" pas de deux ..."when those two came on, good Lord! I have never seen such a public. You would have thought their seats were on fire."&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Richard, ''Diaghilev'', 1979, ISBN 0-297-775065, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Vaslav Nijinsky]] had attended the [[Imperial Ballet School]], St. Petersburg since the age of eight.  He graduated in 1907 and joined the Imperial Ballet where he immediately began to take starring roles. Diaghilev invited him to join the Ballets Russes for its first Paris season.

In 1912, Diaghilev gave Nijinsky his first opportunity as a choreographer, for his production of ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'Après-midi d'un faune]]'' to [[Claude Debussy]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]''.  Featuring Nijinsky himself as the Faun, the ballet's frankly erotic nature caused a sensation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The following year, Nijinsky choreographed a new work by Debussy composed expressly for the Ballets Russes, ''[[Jeux]]''. Indifferently received by the public, ''Jeux'' was eclipsed two weeks later by the premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (''Le Sacre du printemps''), also choreographed by Nijinsky.

&lt;!--as well as the set designer [[Roerich]]. In Nijinsky's time, the work was shocking and controversial, both for the music and wildness of the dance. As a result, many people in the theater on opening night created a near riot. Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer have since reconstructed the piece, including sets and costumes, and set it on the Joffrey Ballet. --&gt; 
Because of mental illness, Nijinsky eventually retired from dance; he was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].
===Léonide Massine===
[[Léonide Massine]] was born in Moscow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Leonide Massine|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/choreographers/massine_l.html|publisher=[[American Ballet Theatre]]|accessdate=17 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213084747/http://abt.org/education/archive/choreographers/massine_l.html| archivedate= 13 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied both acting and dancing at the Imperial School.  On the verge of becoming an actor, Massine was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes, as he was seeking a replacement for Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev encouraged Massine's creativity and his entry into choreography.

Massine's most famous creations for the Ballets Russes were ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'', and ''[[Pulcinella]]''.  In all three of these works, he collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso]], who designed the sets and costumes.
 
Massine extended Fokine's choreographic innovations, especially those relating to narrative and character.  His ballets incorporated both folk dance and ''demi-charactère'' dance, a style using classical technique to perform [[character dance]]. Massine created contrasts in his choreography, such as synchronized yet individual movement, or small-group dance patterns within the ''[[corps de ballet]]''.[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Saison Russe 1913, Petrouchka, MS Thr 965 (7) retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Bronislava Nijinska]] in ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''|left|246x246px]]
===Bronislava Nijinska===
[[Bronislava Nijinska]] was the younger sister of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. She trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, joining the Imperial Ballet company in 1908. From 1909, she (like her brother) was a member of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.

In 1915, Nijinska and her husband fled to Kiev to escape World War I.  There, she founded the École de movement, where she trained Ukrainian artists in modern dance.  Her most prominent pupil was [[Serge Lifar]] (who later joined the Ballets Russes in 1923).

Following the Russian Revolution, Nijinska fled again to Poland, and then, in 1921, re-joined the Ballets Russes in Paris.  In 1923, Diaghilev assigned her the choreography of Stravinsky's ''[[Les Noces]].''  The result combines elements of her brother's choreography for ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with more traditional aspects of ballet, such as dancing ''[[Pointe technique|en pointe.]]'' The following year, she choreographed three new works for the company: ''[[Les biches]]'', ''Les Fâcheux'', and ''[[Le Train Bleu (ballet)|Le train bleu]]''.

{{Clear}}

===George Balanchine===
Born Giorgi Melitonovitch Balanchivadze in Saint Petersburg, [[George Balanchine]] was trained at the Imperial School of Ballet.  His education there was interrupted by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].  Balanchine graduated in 1921, after the school reopened.  He subsequently studied music theory, composition, and advanced piano at the [[Petrograd Conservatory]], graduating in 1923. During this time, he worked with the ''corps de ballet'' of the [[Mariinsky Theater]].  In 1924, Balanchine (and his first wife, ballerina [[Tamara Geva]]) fled to Paris while on tour of Germany with the Soviet State Dancers.  He was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes as a choreographer.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Joseph. ''Artists in Exile: How Refugees from Twentieth-Century War and Revolution Transformed the American Performing Arts'', New York: Harper Collins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Balanchine choreographed ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon musagète]]'' and ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|Le fils prodigue]]'' for the company. 
--&gt;

==The designers==
Diaghilev invited the collaboration of contemporary fine artists in the design of sets and costumes.  These included [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Coco Chanel]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Pavel Tchelitchev]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], and [[Georges Rouault]].

Their designs contributed to the groundbreaking excitement of the company's productions. The scandal caused by the premiere performance in Paris of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' has been partly attributed to the provocative aesthetic of the costumes of the Ballets Russes.&lt;ref name="Albert 2010"&gt;{{cite news | title=Inside the dress circle | author=Albert, Jane | date=2010-12-11 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald, "Spectrum" section | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexandre Benois===
[[Alexandre Benois]] had been the most influential member of The [[Nevsky Pickwickians]] and was one of the original founders (with Bakst and Diaghilev) of ''[[Mir iskusstva]]''. His particular interest in ballet as an art form strongly influenced Diaghilev and was seminal in the formation of the Ballets Russes. In addition, Benois contributed scenic and costume designs to several of the company's earlier productions: ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'', portions of ''Le Festin'', and ''[[Giselle]]''. Benois also participated with [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Michel Fokine]] in the creation of ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', to which he contributed much of the scenario as well as the stage sets and costumes.

===Léon Bakst===
[[File:Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for Parade (Ballets Russes) at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, 1917, Lachmann photographer.jpg|thumb|320x320px|[[Pablo Picasso]] (wearing a beret) and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'']]
[[Léon Bakst]] was also an original member of both The [[Nevsky Pickwickians]] and ''[[Mir iskusstva]]''. He participated as designer in productions of the Ballets Russes from its beginning in 1909 until 1921, creating sets and costumes for ''[[Scheherazade (ballet)|Scheherazade]]'', ''[[The Firebird]]'', [["Les Orientales"|''Les Orientales'']], ''[[Le Spectre de la rose]]'', ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'Après-midi d'une faune]]'', and ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'', among other productions.

===Pablo Picasso===
{{main article|Picasso and the Ballets Russes}}
In 1917, [[Pablo Picasso]] designed sets and costumes in the [[Cubist]] style for three Diaghilev ballets, all with choreography by [[Léonide Massine]]:  ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'', and ''[[Pulcinella]]''.

===Natalia Goncharova===
[[Natalia Goncharova]] was born in 1881 near [[Tula, Russia]]. Her art was inspired by Russian folk art, [[Fauvism]], and cubism. She began designing for the Ballets Russes in 1921.

Although the Ballets Russes firmly established the 20th-century tradition of fine art theatre design, the company was not unique in its employment of fine artists.  For instance, [[Savva Mamontov]]'s Private Opera Company had made a policy of employing fine artists, such as [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Golovin]], who went on to work for the Ballets Russes.

==The composers and conductors==
[[File:Stravinsky-Nijinsky-Petrouchka.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|[[Igor Stravinsky]] with [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in costume for ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''.]]
For his new productions, Diaghilev commissioned the foremost composers of the 20th century, including: [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Erik Satie|Satie]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]]. He was also responsible for commissioning the first two significant British-composed ballets: ''Romeo and Juliet'' (composed in 1925 by nineteen-year-old [[Constant Lambert]]) and ''The Triumph of Neptune'' (composed in 1926 by [[Lord Berners]]).

The impresario also engaged conductors who were or became eminent in their field during the 20th century, including [[Pierre Monteux]] (1911–16 and 1924), [[Ernest Ansermet]] (1915–23), [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]] (1919–20) and [[Roger Désormière]] (1925–29).&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Buckle|Buckle, Richard]]. Diaghilev. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igor Stravinsky===
Diaghilev hired the young Stravinsky at a time when he was virtually unknown to compose the music for ''[[The Firebird]]'', after the composer [[Anatoly Lyadov]] proved unreliable, and this was instrumental in launching Stravinsky's career in Europe and the United States of America.

Stravinsky's early ballet scores were the subject of much discussion. ''The Firebird'' (1910) was seen as an astonishingly accomplished work for such a young artist ([[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] is said to have remarked drily: "Well, you've got to start somewhere!"). Many contemporary audiences found ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) to be almost unbearably dissonant and confused. ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913) nearly caused an audience riot. It stunned people because of its willful rhythms and aggressive dynamics. The audience's negative reaction to it is now regarded as a theatrical scandal as notorious as the failed runs of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' at Paris in 1861 and [[Jean-Georges Noverre]]'s ''[[Les Fêtes Chinoises]]'' in London on the eve of the [[Seven Years' War]]. However, Stravinsky's early ballet scores are now widely considered masterpieces of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/milestones/991110.motm.riteofspring.html|title=Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring"|author=Thomas Kelly|year=1999|publisher=National Public Radio|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Film of a performance==
Diaghilev always maintained that no camera could ever do justice to the artistry of his dancers, and it was long believed there was no film legacy of the Ballets Russes.  However, in 2011 a 30-second newsreel film of a performance in [[Montreux, Switzerland]], in June 1928 came to light.  The ballet was ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' and the lead dancer was identified as [[Serge Lifar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/31/ballet-russes-captured-on-film Maev Kennedy, "Ballets Russes brought back to life on film", ''The Guardian'', 1 February 2011].Retrieved 10 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centennial exhibitions and celebrations==
[[File:Russia-2000-stamp-Sergei Diaghilev.jpg|alt=Stamp with drawings of Diaghilev and several ballet dancers|thumb|Russian stamp: [[Sergei Diaghilev]]]]
'''Paris, 2008''': In September 2008, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Ballets Russes, [[Sotheby's]] announced the staging of an exceptional exhibition of works lent mainly by French, British and Russian private collectors, museums and foundations. Some 150 paintings, designs, costumes, theatre decors, drawings, sculptures, photographs, manuscripts, and programs were exhibited in Paris, retracing the key moments in the history of the Ballets Russes. On display were costumes designed by [[André Derain]] (''[[La Boutique fantasque]]'', 1919) and [[Henri Matisse]] (''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', 1920), and [[Léon Bakst]].

Posters recalling the surge of creativity that surrounded the Ballets Russes included [[Pablo Picasso]]'s iconic image of the Chinese Conjuror for the audacious production of ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' and [[Jean Cocteau]]'s poster for ''[[Le Spectre de la rose]]''. Costumes and stage designs presented included works by [[Alexandre Benois|Alexander Benois]], for ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'' and ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''; Léon Bakst, for ''[[La Péri (Dukas)|La Péri]]'' and ''[[Le Dieu bleu]]''; [[Mikhail Larionov]], for ''Le Soleil à Minuit''; and [[Natalia Goncharova]], for ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1925 version). The exhibition also included important contemporary artists, whose works reflected the visual heritage of the Ballets Russes – notably an installation made of colorfully painted paper by the renowned Belgian artist [[Isabelle de Borchgrave]], and items from the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg|Imperial Porcelain Factory]] in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ballets-russes.com/paris.html| title=Dancing into Glory: The Golden Age of the Ballets Russes |publisher=''Ballets-Russes.com'' |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Billy Keikeya''' is a [[fictional character]] in the miniseries and television remake of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. He is portrayed by [[Paul Campbell (Canadian actor)|Paul Campbell]]. Billy appeared until late in the second season, at which point he was killed by terrorists. Paul Campbell has said that his character was killed because he had been unwilling to commit to a five-year contract.

In the miniseries, Keikeya was assigned to Secretary of Education [[Laura Roslin]] as an aide during the decommissioning of the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. As he and Roslin were en route back to Caprica, the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack occurred, forcing Roslin to assume the presidency. Keikeya lost most of his family on Picon during the attack. After the Galactica and the remnants of society fled the Cylon attack, Keikeya continued to work with the President, rarely leaving her side.

Billy was among the first to deduce that Roslin was dying of cancer. Both he and Roslin developed a strong loyalty to each other; Roslin once commented that Billy was like a son to her, and the closest thing to family she had. According to [[William Adama|Commander Adama]], Roslin said she saw similarities between Keikeya and the late President [[Richard Adar]] and believed that Keikeya would be President one day. Billy used to be in a debate team back on Caprica.

During the military coup that put Roslin in prison, Keikeya worked with several of Galactica's crewmembers to break her out. However, Keikeya refused to escape with Roslin after the breakout, fearing her break with the military could cause serious fractures within the fleet. Keikeya later traveled with Adama to locate Roslin on the surface of [[Kobol]] and reunite the fleet. Keikeya was also one of the few people to enter the Tomb of Athena and see the map to Earth ([[Home (Battlestar Galactica)#Part 2|Home, Part II]]).

During much of his time after the Cylon attack, Keikeya was in a romantic relationship with [[Anastasia Dualla|Petty Officer Anastasia "Dee" Dualla]]. He eventually proposed to her; however, she said that she could never marry him. Keikeya later discovered Dualla and [[Lee Adama]] in a romantic setting on ''[[Cloud Nine (starship)|Cloud Nine]]''. The establishment was seized by terrorists. During the incident, Keikeya tried to convince one of the terrorists, Vinson, that what he was doing was wrong.  When Vinson revealed he was doing it because he lost his brother in a Cylon attack, Billy related that he'd lost his own family in the destruction of the Colonies.  Throughout the incident, Billy eyed a terrorist's gun, but Dee told him not to try as he wasn't military.  When the ruse Admiral Adama used to try to defuse the situation is discovered, the terrorist leader orders Dee's death.  Billy grabs a gun from a terrorist and shoots Dee's would-be killer, Vinson, but Billy is shot and killed in return.  Roslin later cries over his body in the morgue (having earlier told Adama that Billy was the only family she had left) and is seen to keep a picture of him on her desk.  He was soon replaced by [[Tory Foster]] as Roslin's aide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">The '''blue-green [[shan shui]]''' ({{zh|s=青绿山水|t=青綠山水|p=Qīng-Lǜ Shān-Shuǐ}}), is a Chinese [[painting]] style of "[[Shan shui]]". It tends to refer to an "ancient style" rather than modern ones. The main colours of the paintings are [[blue]]s and [[green]]s, and in the early period it was painted using [[mineral]] [[dye]]s. It's said this style was first formulated by Li Sixun ({{zh|s=[[:zh:李思训|李思训]]|t=李思訓|p=Lǐ Sī-Xùn|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="Baidu Li Sixun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/94288.htm |title=李思训 (''Li Sixun (Tang Dynasty general, politician and painter)'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general, politician and famous painter in [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/6996.htm |title=青绿山水 (''Blue-green Shan Shui'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar styles appeared before the [[Tang Dynasty]], especially in the period of the [[Six Dynasties]].&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt; Many historic records show that Li father and sons – Li Sixun (father) and Li Zhaodao (son, {{zh|c=[[:zh:李昭道|李昭道]]|p=Lǐ Zhāo-Dào|links=no}}, son of Li Sixun), largely developed the painting techniques and formulated the style.&lt;ref name="Baidu Li Sixun"/&gt;

There are mainly two styles of this painting:&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt;

[[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]]:
* The ''little blue-green shan shui'' is the dominant style/school. Especially in the Late [[Ming Dynasty]], the painter [[Lan Ying]] (Chinese: 蓝瑛; Pinyin: Lán Yīng) from [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]] (Chinese: [[:zh:浙派|浙派]]) developed the style to an historic climax.&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baidu Lan Ying"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/88731.htm |title=蓝瑛 (''Lan Ying (painter)'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Bram''' (born May 9, 1955 in [[Chicago]]), raised in [[Deerfield, Illinois]], played a minor role in the [[underground comix]] movement with his contributions to ''[[American Splendor]]'', the comic book series written and published by [[Harvey Pekar]].

Bram's first paid illustration job was a logo for a local rock band. At 17 he began contributing to ''Triad'', a Chicago-based alternative magazine that published work by Skip Williamson and others. At 18 Bram served briefly as art director for the magazine.

Bram moved to [[Cleveland]] in 1975 to major in design and illustration at the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]]. Underground cartoonist [[Jay Lynch]] introduced him to Pekar who hired him to illustrate stories in the first issue of ''American Splendor''. Bram contributed to the first two issues of ''American Splendor'', along with artists [[Gary Dumm]], Gregg Budgett, and [[Robert Crumb]]. He provided the art for ''Remembering Be-Ins'' in ''American Splendor'' #1 (1974) and ''Rollins on Mars'', ''May 4–5, 1970'', and ''Zoology'' in ''American Splendor'' #2 (1977). In 1980 he moved to [[Rochester, NY]] to study film and animation at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].

In 1983 Bram produced and hosted an all-night movie program on [[WUHF]] (Channel 31; then an independent station; now part of the Fox network). In addition to movies, the program was a forum for local bands including Personal Effects, [[The Silly Pillows|The Degrads]], and Cousin Al and the Relatives.

Since 1987 Bram has been living in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and working as a creative director in the interactive industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41115">[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 040.jpg|thumb|Viking period brooch in silver from the [[Penrith Hoard]]]]
[[File:RogartDSCF6220.jpg|thumb|The Rogart brooch, National Museums of Scotland, FC2. [[Pict]]ish penannular brooch, Scotland, 8th century, silver with gilding and glass.  Classified as Fowler H3 type.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 111, with a plate showing the decoration much better; Laing, 310&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Celtic brooch''', more properly called the '''penannular brooch''', and its closely related type, the '''pseudo-penannular brooch''', are types of [[brooch]] clothes fasteners, often rather large; penannular means formed as an incomplete ring. They are especially associated with the beginning of the [[Early Medieval]] period in the British Isles, although they are found in other times and places—for example, forming part of traditional female dress in areas in modern [[North Africa]].

Beginning as utilitarian fasteners in the [[Iron Age]] and Roman period, they are especially associated with the highly ornate brooches produced in precious metal for the elites of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] from about 700 to 900, which are popularly known as Celtic brooches or similar terms. They are the most significant objects in high-quality secular metalwork from Early Medieval [[Celtic art]], or [[Insular art]], as art historians prefer to call it.  The type continued in simpler forms such as the '''thistle brooch''' into the 11th century, during what is often known as the [[Viking]] Age in Ireland and Scotland.

Both penannular and pseudo-penannular brooches feature a long pin attached by its head to a ring; the pin can move freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which are close together.  In the true penannular type, the ring is not closed; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through. In the pseudo-penannular type, the ring is closed, but there are still two separately defined terminals, which are joined by a further element. The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely woven cloth (where the pin will not leave a permanent hole), but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient.

The brooches were worn by both men and women, usually singly at the shoulder by men and on the breast by women, and with the pin pointing up; an Irish law code says that in the event of injury from a pin to another person, the wearer is not at fault if the pin did not project too far and the brooch was worn in these ways by the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89, NMI, O'Floinn, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  The most elaborate examples were clearly significant expressions of status at the top of society, which were also worn by clergy, at least in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 72, NMI, O'Floinn, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; though probably to fasten [[cope]]s and other [[vestment]]s rather than as everyday wear.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Senchas Mhor'', an [[early Irish law]] tract, specified that the sons of major kings, when being [[fostering|fostered]], should have "brooches of gold having crystal inserted in them", while the sons of minor kings need wear only silver brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tara Brooch]], the most ornate of all, also decorated on the back (see below). Irish, early 8th century.]]
"Annular" means formed as a ring and "penannular" formed as an incomplete ring; both terms have a range of uses. "Pseudo-penannular" is a coinage restricted to brooches, and refers to those brooches where there is no opening in the ring, but the design retains features of a penannular brooch—for example, emphasizing two terminals. Some pseudo-penannular brooches are very similar in design to other penannular brooches, but have a small section joining the two terminals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this brooch in the British Museum. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_ring_brooch.aspx Silver ring brooch]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have fully joined terminals, and emphasize in their design the central area where the gap would be—for example the Tara Brooch. Pseudo-penannular brooches may also be described as "annular", or as "ring brooches".&lt;ref&gt;The last favoured by NMI, O'Floinn, 177 and entries.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "open brooch" or "open ring brooch" are also sometimes used for penannular brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially in material aimed at the general public, to avoid the "p" word—for example, "open brooch" in the headings of the database of the National Museums of Scotland, but not in the detailed descriptions. The British Museum display captions favour "open ring".&lt;/ref&gt; There is a scheme of classification originally set out, in relation to earlier types, by Elizabeth Fowler in the 1960s, which has since been extended in various versions to cover later types.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler's two papers are in Further Reading. Laing 304–316 summarizes one version of the expanded typology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooches of either penannular or annular type, where the pin is very large in relation to the ring, so that the ring cannot play any part in the fastening of the brooch, may be called "ring brooches", "pin brooches", or "brooch-pins"; or, especially where the ring is small and plain, "ringed pins".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 316 and 318–320, using both, but distinguishing between them. Youngs uses the second and third (no.s 90–92, 95–96), Edwards, 141 the last.&lt;/ref&gt; In these, the design of the pin head typically shows that the pin is intended to sit underneath the ring (seen from the front), rather than on top of it as in the larger brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Usually the pin is bent round to form a simple ring, and though the pin may be capable of being swivelled round to sit in front of the ring, it will then project away from the ring.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Celtic" is a term avoided by specialists in describing objects, and especially artistic styles, of the Early Middle Ages from the British Isles, but is firmly fixed in the popular mind.  The term [[Insular art]] is used to describe the distinct style of art originating in the British Isles and combining Germanic, Celtic, Pictish and Mediterranean elements.  Although some simpler and relatively early penannular brooches are found in [[Anglo-Saxon]] contexts, and some sub-types predominantly so,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; as far as is known the Anglo-Saxons did not use these brooch styles for prestige elite jewellery.  However, there are elements in the style of Irish and Scottish brooches deriving from [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and related to Insular work in other media, especially [[illuminated manuscript]]s.

''[[Fibula (brooch)|Fibula]]'' is Latin for "brooch" and is used in modern languages to describe the many types of Roman and post-Roman Early Medieval brooches with pins and catches behind the main face of the brooch. The brooches discussed here are sometimes also called ''fibulae'', but rarely by English-speaking specialists.

==Fastening the brooches==

With a penannular brooch, the pin is pushed through folds of the cloth, which are then pulled back inside the ring; the free end of the pin passes through the gap in the ring. The pin is then rotated around the ring by 90 degrees or so, so that as long as the pin is held down by slight pressure it cannot escape over the terminals, and the fastening is secure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 229–230, with diagrams. There is a short video sequence [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ssoy95w1Fs here]. See also Johns, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

With pseudo-penannular brooches, things are not so simple and the manner in which they were used is still debated; the method was probably not the same for all brooches. One method may have been to pull folds of the cloth through the ring until they could be pierced by the pin, and then pull the cloth back until the pin rested on the ring. This would work best with brooches with a pin not much longer than the diameter of the ring, which some have, but others do not. The second method might have been simply to pin the cloth vertically, leaving the ring hanging unattached to the cloth; this does not seem very secure.  The third method relied on a length of chain or cord attached to the ring near the "terminals" (which in pseudo-penannular brooches do not actually terminate), which was used to secure the pin by tying it down, perhaps with a small pin at the end, which was also put through the cloth.  The [[Tara Brooch]] was probably fastened in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 229–230, with diagram of the Tara Brooch; see also a [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-001-178-C&amp;scache=73160e864v&amp;searchdb=scran series of photos from the National Museums of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the pin was fitted with a bolt or rivet to make it removable.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 310&lt;/ref&gt;  A further complication is that in some pseudo-penannular brooches the pin is fixed to lie in front of the ring, as in the [[Londesborough Brooch]] (below), but in others it crosses through the ring, starting with the head end in front of the ring, but the middle of the pin behind the ring by the point where it crosses at the other side; the Tara Brooch has been displayed set up in both ways.&lt;ref&gt;The photographs here, showing the pin lying on top, were taken at the NMI in 2010; the illustrations in "NMI" of 2002, and Youngs of 1989, show it crossing through the ring.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter arrangement seems more common in later brooches, of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;For example the Roscrea, Ardagh, and Killamery Brooches - respectively Youngs, nos. 79, 76 &amp; 80, and also in NMI. Which brooches have removable pins, so that the arrangement can be altered, is not always clear from the sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is fair to say that scholars remain slightly puzzled that the effective and simple penannular brooch developed in this direction,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Youngs, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is presumed that the reuniting of the terminals of pseudo-penannular brooches was partly to strengthen the brooch. In many penannular brooches, the gap between the terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.

==History==

===Roman and early Insular period===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Dinas Powys Brooch.jpg|thumb|left|6th century fragment of a penannular brooch with enamel on the flared terminals, from [[Dinas Powys]], Wales, shown with an artist's reconstruction.]] --&gt;
Small and simple penannular brooches in bronze, iron, and, rarely, silver were common in the Roman period as a practical fastener, but were not used for high-status objects, and any decoration was normally limited to bands around the ring or other simple patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 150–151. Examples of Romano-British penannular broches from [http://www.darwincountry.org/explore/013338.html Darwin Country]&lt;/ref&gt; Often the extra thickness at the terminal, necessary to prevent the pin just falling off, is achieved simply by turning back the ends of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukdfd.co.uk/ukdfddata/showrecords.php?product=632&amp;cat=all Example from the UK Detector Finds Database]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Roman period in Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries, a type of penannular brooch with [[zoomorphic]] decoration to the terminals appeared, with human or animal heads, still not much wider than the rest of the ring.  Some examples had [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] decoration, and the pin did not extend much beyond the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 21, and no. 15. NMI, O'Floinn, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  These are found especially in southwestern Britain and [[Wales]], and seem to have developed in these areas. This type fell from favour in southern Britain by the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 173; [http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.php/objectbiographies/74-an-irish-bronze-brooch-18847913 another summary account]&lt;/ref&gt; but was developed in Ireland by the 6–7th centuries. These types considerably extended the size of the terminals, which now presented a flattish area often decorated with enamel or glass inlay, mostly using abstracted patterns but sometimes zoomorphic decoration. The length of the pin is now often about twice the diameter of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 21–22, and catalogue nos. 16–19; NMI, no. 5:5; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/penannular_brooch.aspx example from the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Irish cultural zone in this period included much of Western Scotland, and in [[Pict]]ish East Scotland a similar development took place, though the forms are somewhat different here. The decoration paralleled that on other metalwork fittings such as pieces of harness-tackle,&lt;ref&gt;See Youngs, 117–120 for examples&lt;/ref&gt; and the few remaining early Christian [[reliquaries]] and other pieces of church metalwork.

===Golden Age===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 028 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Tara Brooch]], rear view.]]

By shortly after 700, highly elaborate, large brooches in precious metal and gems were being produced. These were clearly expressions of high status for the wearer, and use the full repertoire of [[goldsmith]]'s techniques at a very high level of skill. They continued to be produced for about 200 years; the Pictish brooches are much more homogeneous in design than the Irish ones, which may indicate a shorter period of production, possibly from "the mid-eighth to the beginning of the ninth centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; Each surviving design is unique, but the range of types established in the more modest earlier brooches are developed and elaborated upon.  There was no previous tradition of very ornate brooches in Ireland, and this development may have come from contact with Continental elites who wore large [[fibula (brooch)|''fibulae'']] as marks of status.  Such contacts were certainly made, especially by travelling monks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological, and some literary, evidence suggests that brooches in precious metal were a mark of royal status, along with wearing a purple cloak, and it is probably as such that they are worn by [[Christ]] on a [[high cross]] at [[Monasterboice]] and by the [[Virgin Mary]] on another.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 223-226&lt;/ref&gt;  All surviving examples, numbering over 50 (not all complete) in the case of the Irish ones,&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 177&lt;/ref&gt; have been recovered by excavation, or at least finding in the ground, but where the detailed circumstances of the find are known, few are from graves, and finds in hoards are much more common.  When they were in graves, the burials are often much later than the date of the brooch,&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304,&lt;/ref&gt; as in a brooch in the Irish 8th century style found in a Norse burial in [[Westray]], [[Orkney]],&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Kilmainham Brooch.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, Harrison, 72; Youngs, no. 74; NMI, 185&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate brooches often have one or more names—presumed to be those of owners—scratched on the reverse, often in [[rune]]s. Plainer brooches in bronze and similar alloys continue to be found in much larger numbers.

The most elaborate Irish brooches are pseudo-penannular, while the Scottish ones mostly retain true penannular forms.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are [[silver-gilt]], the gilding often partial. Some are gilded base metal, of bronze or copper-alloy;&lt;ref&gt;For example, Youngs nos.195 and 75&lt;/ref&gt; only one solid gold Irish brooch is known, a 9th-century one from Loughan, [[County Londonderry]], which is less elaborate than most of the series, though the standard of work is very high.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 83; NMI, 184; [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/derry.html photo]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some brooches have a hidden recess which may have contained small lead weights to make the precious metal used seem more valuable than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_ring_brooch.aspx British Museum], mentioning two examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the head of the pin might be turned into a focus for decoration, sometimes using a "kite"-shaped plate, such as that on the Tara Brooch; in Scotland, the pin-heads were simple circles formed by bending the pin back on itself.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish terminals are more often distinct lobed or square shapes extending beyond the circle of the ring on both sides, while in Irish examples, the terminals typically extend inside the ring forming another curve, but not much outside it, or sometimes form a straight line across the interior of the ring.  Irish brooches may only join the two terminals by narrow strips, or not only eliminate the gap entirely, but have a central zone of decoration where the gap between the terminals would have been; the brooches found with the [[Ardagh Chalice]] show both types.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 245&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 016.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Londesborough Brooch]]]]

The main body was normally cast, and a number of elements of two-piece moulds have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 170–171, 189–193; NMI, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;  Many brooches have cells for studs or bosses that are most often round hemispheres, but may be square, lozenges or other shapes; very often the studs themselves are now missing.  These are in a variety of materials including glass, enamel, [[amber]], and gemstones found locally, although not including any of the classic modern "precious stones", or even the [[garnet]]s found in Anglo-Saxon jewellery.  However the ''[[millefiori]]'' glass rods sometimes used appear to have been imported from Italy, like those used in the Anglo-Saxon jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]]; examples of the rods have been excavated in both Ireland and England.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 202–204&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Insular chalices and other metalwork, the very ornate Irish brooches were mostly made in many pieces which are pinned or slotted together. Filigree decoration was often made on "trays" which fitted into the main ring — on the Tara Brooch many of these are now missing (most were still in place when it was found in 1850).
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 015-crop.jpg|thumb|The [[Breadalbane Brooch]], Irish 8th century, converted from its original pseudo-penannular form in 9th century Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Techniques include [[chip-carving]], cast "imitation chip-carving", [[filigree]], [[engraving]], inlays of various types including [[niello]], glass and [[champlevé]] enamel, and various hammering and chasing techniques: "the range of materials and techniques is almost the full range known to man."&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 171–173, quote 171&lt;/ref&gt;  Two techniques that do not appear are the "true pierced openwork ''[[interasile]]'', much used in Byzantine jewellery",&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cloisonné]] work that typified much Western European jewellery, and especially large fibulae, at the time, whether in enamel or stone inlays like the garnets used so effectively at Sutton Hoo and in the Anglo-Saxon [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. In the gilded brooches, enamel is restricted to studs that punctuate the composition like gems; the larger areas of champlevé found on the flared terminals of earlier types perhaps continue in simpler types, though dating is difficult.

On some brooches the decoration is too detailed to be appreciated when the brooch is being worn, and some of the most elaborate brooches have their backs, invisible when worn, decorated almost as elaborately as their fronts. The Tara Brooch shows both features, and in addition, shares with some others a difference in decorative styles between front and back, with "Celtic" [[triskele]]s and other spiral motifs restricted to the back, while the front has more [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] and zoomorphic elements.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 177; Youngs, 207&lt;/ref&gt; These features are also shared by the most ornate brooches in London and Edinburgh, respectively the Londesborough and [[Hunterston Brooch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, nos. 69 and 71; [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/results.php?offset=1&amp;no_results=12&amp;scache=73160e864v&amp;searchdb=scran&amp;sortby=&amp;sortorder=ASC&amp;field=&amp;searchterm=%2B%22Melbrigda%22 Hunterston Brooch from NMI]; see external links for the other museum pages.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be because decoration on the backs relies more on engraving than filigree, which would risk wires getting caught in the clothing on which the brooch was worn.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Few of the major brooches, or indeed other metalwork, have been found in contexts that can be easily dated, and much of the dating of at least the earlier ones comes from comparison with Insular [[illuminated manuscript]]s, though the dating of these is often itself far from certain. The Tara Brooch has long been recognised as having clear stylistic similarities to the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], thought to date to about 698–715.  Many of the similarities are to the [[carpet page]]s, highly detailed ornamental pages filled with decoration, which share with the brooch a certain ''[[horror vacui]]'' that leaves no area unembellished, and also complex decoration that is extremely small and perfectly executed, and best appreciated when seen at a larger than actual scale, whether in the original or in photographs. Both combine elements from many stylistic origins into a style that is distinctly Insular: La Tène Celtic art, Germanic [[animal style]], and classical and other Mediterranean styles.

===Later brooches, and the Vikings===
[[File:Britishmuseumpenrithhoardbrooches.jpg|thumb|[[Viking]] period pennannular brooches from the [[Penrith Hoard]], three of the "[[thistle]]" type.]]
The [[Vikings]] began to raid Ireland from 795, with catastrophic effect for the [[monastery|monasteries]] in particular.  However, although the Vikings established several [[longphort]]s, initially fortified encampments for over-wintering, and later towns like [[Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and [[Waterford]] (the first real urban centres in Ireland), the native Irish were more successful than the English and Scots in preventing large-scale Viking takeovers of areas for settlement by farmers.  By about the year 1000, the situation was relatively stable, with a mixed population of [[Norse-Gaels]] in the towns and areas close to them, while the Gaelic Irish, whose elite had often formed political alliances, trading partnerships and inter-marriages with Viking leaders, remained in control of the great majority of the island, and were able to draw tribute from the Viking towns.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, Doherty, 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

The period is characterised by a greatly increased availability of silver, presumably the result of Viking raiding and trading, and most brooches are made from silver throughout, as gilding and decoration in other materials nearly disappears.  The brooches are often large and relatively massive, but plainer than the most elaborate earlier ones, neither using older local decorative styles nor the Viking styles that were adopted in other media.  This continues a trend that can be detected in later brooches from the preceding period, before much Viking influence can have made itself felt.  The 9th century Roscrea Brooch is one of a number of transitional brooches; though its form is highly ornate, with a large flat triangular pin head, the ring is thick plain silver, the gold filigree panels occupy relatively small areas, and their workmanship is a "coarse" or "crude" imitation of that of earlier works.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 215–216, and 230, "crude"; Youngs, no. 79, "coarse". [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/roscrea.html Illustration here]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kilamery Brooch is a comparable example, with a marked emphasis on plain flat silver surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 215; [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/kilamery.html photo]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are rare exceptions in which a highly decorated brooch shows Scandinavian stylistic and technical influence, notably an Irish brooch from [[Rathlin Island]], with areas stamped where the Irish tradition would have used casting.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, O'Floinn, 90;&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooches appear to have been made by "native" metalworkers, but worn by both Vikings and Gaels.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, Wallace, 213–216&lt;/ref&gt; The very popular '''thistle brooches''' have terminals and often pin-heads that are like [[thistle]] flowers, with a ball topped by a round projection, often flared; they are called by the term regardless of whether or not the ball is "brambled"—that is, formed with a regular pattern of small tapering projections, like the two lowest brooches from the [[Penrith Hoard]] illustrated here.  These, and other globular endings to terminals and pin-heads, were common, but flattened terminals continued to be made, now ornamented by round silver bosses amid simple repeated patterns, or interlace that is larger in scale than in the earlier ornate badges.  In these, the ring often ends in a "gripping beast" biting the terminal plate. The mixture of types seen in the 10th century Penrith Hoard is typical.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the very similar selections of brooches illustrated at NMI 238 and 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 036.jpg|thumb|left|Brooches made in Scandinavia, mostly in base metal]]

Insular brooches had been taken back to Scandinavia, and began to be produced there in the 10th century for wearing singly by men at the shoulder; Viking women wore pairs of characteristic oval brooches on the upper breast.&lt;ref&gt;Vikings, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Most were simpler than Insular examples, and several hundred examples in "tinned bronze rather than silver" are known.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, O'Floinn, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  The 10th century Danish Møllerløkken Brooch is the most elaborate example known, with a simple overall design with ball terminals and pin-head, but with rich detailing such as interlace panels on the ring and filigree sections on the balls.&lt;ref&gt;Vikings, 112–113, 146; Ship, O'Floinn, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Insular types were also produced in Viking areas of England, especially [[Scandinavian York]].&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 312&lt;/ref&gt; The penannular brooch fell from common use by the end of the 11th century, a time when Ireland and Scotland, and Scandinavia, were adopting general Western European styles in many areas of both art and life.

A distinctly Irish type of brooch found at the end of the Viking period is the '''kite brooch''', whose name derives from the [[almond]] shape called a "kite" in [[heraldry]], though the shapes of the heads are actually highly variable. They were apparently worn, like the larger brooches, singly with the pin pointing upwards. Only "about half a dozen" exist in silver, including examples that are much larger than average, with pins up to 7.9&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 227&lt;/ref&gt; In these, there is no ring, but the elaborate head is connected to a pin of very variable length by a short tab of metal that can move on joints at both ends; there is also usually a cord for winding round the pin to secure it. Only 14 of these brooches have been found to date in Ireland, many incomplete, and none elsewhere;&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2005), 64–67; [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/arts-literature/the-virtual-museum/waterford-museum-of-treas/personal-adornment/the-waterford-kite-brooch/index.xml The Waterford Kite brooch], plus one in the next reference.&lt;/ref&gt; five of these are from Dublin, the earliest from the 940s.

===Celtic Revival===
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 036-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Early medieval Irish brooch, bronze and glass; note the pin lies entirely in front of the ring in this example.]]
The brooches we have today have been discovered since the 17th century, and their odds on their survival once found have increased greatly over that period, as their value as artefacts has overtaken their scrap value. In the 19th century, as part of the [[Celtic Revival]], many brooches copying or inspired by earlier styles were made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=0&amp;q=penannular+brooch&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= Victorian penannular brooches from the [[V&amp;A Museum]].]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the responsibility for the fashion for high-quality Celtic Revival jewellery belongs to George Waterhouse, a jeweller from [[Sheffield]], England, who moved to [[Dublin]] in 1842.  Before the end of the decade, he and the long-established Dublin firm [[West Jewellers|West &amp; Son]] of [[College Green]] (later moving to [[Grafton Street]]) were finding it necessary to register their designs to prevent copying. Of the various types of objects made, the brooches were both the "most resonant" and those which could be sold with the least alteration to the original form and design, although the jewellers generally reduced their size and fitted them with conventional pins and catches behind, even though the [[Kashmir shawl]]s that were also fashionable at the time were often loosely woven and not unsuitable for fastening in the original way.&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 444.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different versions were made at different price levels, though even the most expensive struggled to recreate the full intricacy of the originals.

The [[National Museum of Ireland]] is clearly not correct in saying that the fashion began after [[Queen Victoria]] was presented with a [[replica]] of the "Cavan Brooch" on her visit to Dublin to see the [[Great Industrial Exhibition (1853)|Great Industrial Exhibition]] in 1853;&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 5:21&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Collection]] has two brooches that [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] bought for her from West &amp; Son in 1849 on an earlier visit to Dublin, which were already being made in editions.  Albert presented them in November and at Christmas that year: "...such beautiful souvenirs, both made after those very curious old Irish ornaments we saw in [[Trinity College, Dublin|the College]] in Dublin, one a silver shawl brooch, in smaller size than the original" was her reaction to the November gift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about Royal Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042602/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about |date=June 9, 2011 }}, Brooch given in November 1849, and [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=4833&amp;row=16&amp;detail=about Christmas 1849]. Their fabrication was sub-contracted to Edward Johnston's workshop.  See also the V&amp;A text at the link above, also dating the fashion to the 1840s.&lt;/ref&gt;  A later gift from Albert included a setting of a [[Smoky quartz|cairngorm]] he had picked up when walking in the [[Scottish Highlands]], a more authentic type of gem than the brightly coloured foreign stones used in much Celtic Revival jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=82803&amp;partid=1 British Museum] Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, with text from "catalogue of Hull Grundy Gift (Gere et al 1984) no. 989" covering other replicas and the revived brooch in general&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[Tara Brooch]] in 1850 could therefore not have been better timed in terms of attracting public interest.  The brooch was immediately recognised as the culminating masterpiece (though early in date) of the Irish development of large and superbly worked ornate brooches, a status it has retained ever since. The brooch was soon acquired by George Waterhouse, who used it as the centre of displays of his replicas and imitations of Celtic brooches in his Dublin shop, also exhibiting it at [[The Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851 and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]], as well as the Dublin exhibition visited by the Queen in 1853 (Victoria had already seen it; it had been specially sent to [[Windsor Castle]] for her inspection).

Waterhouse had invented the brooch's name; in fact, it has nothing to do with the [[Hill of Tara]], but the true circumstances of its find still remain unclear (essentially to avoid a claim by the landowner), and Waterhouse chose to link it to the site associated with the [[High King]]s of Ireland, "fully aware that this would feed the Irish middle-class fantasy of being descended from them".&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 444; British Museum: Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, see note above.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the brooch passed to what is now the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in the 1870s, "Tara brooch" had become a [[Genericized trademark|generic term]] for Celtic Revival brooches, some of which were now being made by [[India]]n workshops for export to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 455&lt;/ref&gt;  Replicas, very rarely fully accurate, and imitations of Celtic brooches have continued to be made to the present day, at varying levels of quality.

==Modern North Africa==
Penannular brooches are part of traditional dress to the present day among [[Berber people|Berber]] women in the [[Maghreb]], usually worn in pairs and apparently pinning straps of a dress to the bodice, with the pins pointing straight up.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 151. [http://www.raqs.co.nz/me/clothing_rectangle.html Photos from Tunisia], and [http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/Africa/Tunisia/North/Zaghouan//photo128538.htm another recent one].&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually large, fairly plain, brooches, not unlike some Viking examples, though another style has a very elaborately decorated head to the pin, which can dwarf the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corbisimages.com/Enlargement/KE003039.html Elaborate Berber brooches] from Corbis.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy necklace often hangs between the two brooches, sometimes attached to a ring hanging from the head of the pin. Most of the women are identified as Berber. Local names for the brooches apparently include ''melia'', ''melehfa'', ''bzima'', ''kitfiyya'', and ''khellala'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and ''tabzimt'', ''tizerzay'', and ''tazersit'' in [[Berber languages|Berber]].  Such styles are believed to have been in use since pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O79372/penannular-brooch-unknown/ Victoria &amp; Albert Museum "Penannular brooch"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">'''Dashabatar Cards''' ({{lang|bn|দশাবতার তাস}}) is a [[card game]] of [[West Bengal]]. It first originated in [[Bishnupur, Bankura|Bishnupur]], the town of [[Bankura district|Bankura District]].&lt;ref name="The Hindu - 5 December 2015 - Preserving Bishnupur’s heritage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/preserving-bishnupurs-heritage/article7950314.ece|title=Preserving Bishnupur’s heritage|last=Singh|first=Shiv Sahay|date=5 December 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[Bir Hambir]], the king of Bishnupur, invented this card.

== Origin ==
In 1592, [[Bir Hambir]] became king of Bishnupur. He had a great relationship with Akbar, so, a lot of times he went to Akbar's court. Seeing the playing of cards he was surprised. Coming to his kingdom, he thought of creating a new card in God-goddess of uniqueness. According to his directive, artist from Bishnupur, Kartik Faujdar, made the Dashabatar Cards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dashavatar-cardmaking-faces-extinction-in-bengal/article6858196.ece|title=Dashavatar card-making faces extinction in Bengal|last=Das|first=Soumya|date=2015-02-05|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-01-24|last2=Das|first2=Soumya|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; kings of [[Mallabhum]] play this card at leisure for entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mallabhum Bishnupur|last=Manaranjan Chandra|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chitrolekha.com/lost-game-dashabatar-taas-of-bishnupur/|title=Lost Game: Dashabatar Taas of Bishnupur - The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|date=2013-03-01|work=The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Indian scholar Haraprasad Shastri said that this game first originated in the 8th century. In 1895 he said in the Asiatic society's journal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...I fully believe that the game was invented about eleven or twelve hundred years before the present date.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because the placement of [[Jagannath]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) is in the 5th position in Dashabatar card, but in common belief, Jagannath is in the 9th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bandyopadhyaya.blogspot.in/2015/11/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html|title=দশাবতার তাস –  এক বিলুপ্তপ্রায় শিল্প ও এক বিলুপ্তপ্রায় খেলা|website=bandyopadhyaya.blogspot.in|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prabhat Kumar Saha, an expert on Dashavatar cards, said: "Malla dynasty ruled from about 12th century AD to 1622". He confirmed that the Foujdars were the only makers of these cards in Bengal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Method ==
The artists from the Faujdar family of Bishnupur specialise in making these cards. At first, a piece of cloth is folded a number of times. Then glue is pasted, made from tamarind seeds. After drying this, a layer of chalk dust is applied on the cards. Both sides are evened out with a smooth stone. The cards are then cut into round shapes of a 4.5-inch radius. Various deities and their symbols are painted on these using various colours. On the reverse part, a layer of lac and vermillion is applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cards ==
Dashavatar cards are the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu - Matsya, Kurma, Baraha, Nrisingha, Buddha(Jagannath), Baaman, Ram, Balaram, Parshuram and Kalki are drawn on these cards. 

The Dashavatar card game is a complicated one. It is played using 120 cards with numerous rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Sital Fouzdar claims to be the 87th generation of artisans.Nowadays, Vidyut Fouzdar makes them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chitrolekha.com/lost-game-dashabatar-taas-of-bishnupur/|title=Lost Game: Dashabatar Taas of Bishnupur – The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|date=2013-03-01|work=The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Eight Men Speak''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[play (theatre)|play]] written in 1933 by a committee of Oscar Ryan, E. Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg.  Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]]. 

The [[agit-prop]] play told the story of [[Tim Buck]] and his arrest as a [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist]] under [[Section 98]] of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime.  However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a [[prison riot]] when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.

The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at [[Toronto]]'s [[Standard Theatre (Toronto)|Standard Theatre]] on December 4, 1933.  The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in [[Winnipeg]] had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.

When the [[Progressive Arts Club]] had a meeting to protest this [[censorship]], a former minister, [[Albert Edward Smith|A. E. Smith]], described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader.  As a result, Smith was indicted for [[sedition]], but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court.  Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.

The '''emblem of [[Angola]]''' reflects the recent past of the new nation.  There is heavy [[Marxism|Marxist]] imagery found on the device (as can be seen when comparing with other examples of so-called "[[socialist heraldry]]"), expanded from what is found on the [[Flag of Angola|national flag]].  

In the center is a [[machete]] and hoe, representing the revolution through which the nation gained independence and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a [[red star|star]], a common symbol in socialist emblems. The star is taken to represent progress. The rising sun is the traditional symbol of a new beginning. These emblems are all enclosed within a circle whose right half is formed by cog-wheel, representing the industrial workers, and whose left half is a half-[[wreath]] of [[maize]] and [[cotton]] leaves, representing agriculture. At the bottom is an open book that represents education.

The banner at the bottom reads ''{{lang|pt|República de Angola}}'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Republic of Angola". This was changed from ''{{lang|pt|República Popular de Angola}}'' ("People's Republic of Angola") in 1990; at the same time the cog-wheel was also changed from gold to silver.

Details of the insignia are laid down in Article 163 of the [[Constitution of Angola]].

When Angola was a Portuguese colony and later a Portuguese province (and thus legally a part of Portugal proper), Angola used coats of arms to represent the nation. These consisted of a shield parted per pale, with the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese arms]] without its usual bordure in the dexter (viewer's left) half and in the sinister (viewer's right) half the arms for Angola itself: a golden elephant and a golden zebra on a purpure field. The wavy bars in the base (''enté en point'') represented Angola's location overseas from metropolitan Portugal.

The '''Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization''' is a document signed in 2004 by a number of non-profit organizations, scientists, academics and other individuals urging the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to focus on the needs of developing countries with respect to [[intellectual property]] legislation.

The authors and signatories believe that the "world is facing a crisis in the governance of [[knowledge]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]", in particular due to unequal access to vital [[medicine]]s and [[education]], anticompetitive [[economics|economic]] practices, concentration of [[ownership]], technological measures such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), the fair compensation of authors and creators, and the locking up of the [[public domain]] by [[private property|private]] interests.

The Declaration criticises WIPO for embracing "a culture of creating and expanding monopoly privileges, often without regard to consequences", and calls for the organization to shift its focus from intellectual property as an end in and of itself, to a means for benefiting [[All humanity|humanity]]. In particular, it calls for a moratorium on the now-common practice of harmonizing intellectual property legislation throughout the [[developing world]] to the laws as they exist in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

In 2009 this resulted into the [[World_Intellectual_Property_Organization#Development_agenda|WIPO Development Agenda]], which incorporated some of the proposals.

'''Giuseppe Penone''' (born 3 April 1947, [[Garessio]], [[Italy]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist and sculptor, known for his large-scale sculptures of trees that are interested in the link between man and the natural world.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/benezit/abstract/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.001.0001/acref-9780199773787-e-00138380?rskey=ueLO0x&amp;result=2 "Giuseppe Penone"], Oxford Art Online, Retrieved 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His early work is often associated with the [[Arte povera]] movement.&lt;ref name="AGO"&gt;[https://ago.ca/exhibitions/giuseppe-penone-hidden-life-within "Giuseppe Penone: The Hidden Life Within"], Art Gallery of Ontario, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Penone was awarded the prestigious [[Praemium Imperiale]] award.&lt;ref name="Imperiale"/&gt; He currently lives and works in [[Turin]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Giuseppe Penone was born on April 3, 1947 in [[Garessio]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In 1970, he graduated from the [[Accademia Albertina]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], where he studied sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mariangoodman.com/sites/default/files/artist/biography_pdf/penonebiography.pdf "Giuseppe Penone"], Marian Goodman Gallery, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Giuseppe Penone The Hidden Life Within.jpg|thumb|left|Penone's ''The Hidden Life Within'']]
Penone's sculptures, installations, and drawings are distinguished by his emphasis on process and his use of natural materials, such as clay, stone, metal, and wood.&lt;ref name="Speaker"&gt;[http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/engage/event?id=260 "360 Speaker Series: Giuseppe Penone"], Nasher Sculpture Center, Retrieved 24 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His work strives to assimilate the natural word with his artistic practice, unifying art and nature.&lt;ref name="Speaker"/&gt; More specifically the tree, a living organism which closely resembles a human figure, is a recurring element in Penone's oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/giuseppe-penone "A Tree in the Wood"], Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Penone created his first ''Albero'' ("Tree") sculpture in 1969, a series which continues to the present.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt; Since this time, his practice has continued to explore and investigate the natural world and the poetic relationship between man and nature, artistic process and natural process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.castellodirivoli.org/en/mostra/giuseppe-penone/ "Giuseppe Penone"], Castello di Rivoli, Retrieved 24 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest works===
In Penone's first exhibition at the age of 21, a one-man show at the Deposito d'Arte Presente in Turin in 1968, he presented works made out of lead, iron, wax, pitch, wood, plaster and burlap. Two of them involved the natural action of the elements: ''Scala d'acqua'' ("Water Ladder"), in which molten pitch was sculpted with a jet of water, and ''Corda, pioggia, zinco. Corda, pioggia, sole'' ("Rope, Rain, Sun"), a structure in movement with its form was altered by weathering.

In December 1968 Penone performed a series of acts in a wood near his home, the region of the [[Maritime Alps]].&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zero-infinity-arte-povera-1962-1972/zero-infinity-atre-povera-1962-8 "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera"], Tate, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, titled ''Alpi Marittime'', Penone intervened in the growth processes of a tree, whose form retained the memory of his gesture over time.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt; One of his acts involved the flow of the waters in a stream, the vital sap which gives strength to the tree and on which the artist draws constantly in his work, a vehicle of growth and proliferation. He interlaced the stems of three saplings in ''Ho intrecciato tre alberi'' ("I Have Interwoven Three Trees") and uses nails to leave the imprint of his hand on the trunk of a tree and then affixed twenty-two pieces of lead to it, the number of his years, joining them up with zinc and copper wire: ''Albero/filo di zinco/rame'' ("Tree/Wire of Zinc/Copper). He enclosed the top of a tree in a net burdened by the weight of plants: ''Crescendo innalzerà la rete'' ("Growing It Will Raise The Net). He pressed his body to a tree and marked on the trunk the points of contact with barbed wire: ''L'albero ricorderà il contatto'' ("The Tree Will Remember the Contact").

In another of Penone's earliest experiments, ''Continuerà a crescere tranne che in quel punto'' ("It Will Continue to Grow Except at that Point") (1968), he inserted a steel cast of his hand in a tree trunk, forcing the tree to grow around his hand.&lt;ref name="Apollo"&gt;[https://www.apollo-magazine.com/force-of-nature-interview-with-giuseppe-penone/ "Force of Nature: Interview with Giuseppe Penone"], Apollo Magazine, Retrieved 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He immersed in a stream a tub of cement with the dimensions of his body on which he had left the imprints of his hands, feet and face: ''La mia altezza, la lunghezza delle mie braccia, il mio spessore in un ruscello'' ("My Height, the Length of My Arms, My Breadth in a Stream").

In 1969, Penone's works were published in the [[Germano Celant]]'s seminal publication ''Arte Povera'' in a form of a sort of diary correlated with drawing, photographs and brief notes.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; Six black-and-white photos, each of which documents a different action, were exhibited at a group exhibition in the gallery of Gian Enzo Sperone in Turin in May of the same year.

Other Penone works include: ''Pane alfabeto'' ("Bread Alphabet"), a large loaf of bread pecked by birds and thereby revealing the metal letters it contains; ''Scrive/legge/ricorda'' (Writes/Reads/Remembers), a steel wedge with the alphabet scored on it embedded in the trunk of a tree; ''Gli anni dell'albero più uno'' ("The Years of the Tree Plus One"); a bough covered with wax with, imprinted on it, the bark of the tree on one side and on the other the gestures of the artist; ''Alberi e pietre'', I'' rami dell'albero più uno, Zona d'ombra'' ("Trees and Stones, The Boughs of the Tree Plus One, Shadow Zone") were all created between 1969 and 1971 in the forest of Garessio, where the artist assimilated his work to the behavior of other living things, for the most part, trees.

In 1969, Penone also produced the work titled ''Il suo essere nel ventiduesimo anno di età in un'ora fantastica'' ("His Being in the Twenty-Second Year of his Age in a Fantastic Hour"), which he created by uncovering within a wooden beam the tree as it was when it was his own age. The trunk and branches are only partially uncovered and reveal their natural origin while remaining partly incorporated in the geometrical structure of the beam. "Rise trees of the wood, of the forest" wrote the artist in a text of 1979, "rise trees of the orchards, of the avenues, of the gardens, of the parks, rise from the wood that you have formed, take us back to the memory of your lives, tell us about the events, the seasons, the contacts of your existence. Take us back to the woodland, the darkness, the shadow, the scent of the undergrowth, the wonder of the cathedral that is born in the wood land".

===1970s===
In 1970, Penone created two sculptures, titled ''Albero di dodici metri'' ("Trees of Twelve Metres"), as performances during ''Aktionsraum 1'' in [[Munich]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Twelve Metres"&gt;[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/penone-tree-of-12-metres-t05557 "Tree of Twelve Metres"], Tate, Retrieved 23 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, Penone carved an existing tree down to a much smaller, more bare beam, and then created new branches so as to transport the tree back to an earlier period of its life.&lt;ref name="Twelve Metres"/&gt; Another ''Albero di dodici metri'', dating
from 1980, was shaved out of a beam to its full height, with the exception of a part at the top of the plant that used to form the base of the sculpture. It was exhibited at the Solomon R. [[Guggenheim Museum of New York]] in 1982 and at the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Nantes in 1986. Other examples of trees, carved in different ways out of beams, make up the various installations titled ''Ripetere il bosco'' ("Repeating the Forest") at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, in 1980 and at the Castello di Rivoli Museo d'Arte Contemporanea in 1991. In his impressive sculpture ''Cedro di Versailles'' ("Cedar of Versailles") of 2004, the profile of the young tree is hewn in the trunk of an ancient cedar uprooted by the storm that wrought havoc in the Forest of Versailles in December 1999.

In ''Rovesciare i propri occhi'' ("Turning One's Eyes Inside Out"), an action of 1970, Penone wears mirror-finish contact lenses that interrupt the channel of visual information between the individual and his surroundings, entrusting to photography the possibility of seeing in the future the images that the eye should have collected.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt; "The work of the poet," Penone wrote, "is to reflect like a mirror the visions that his sensibility has given him, to produce the sights, the images necessary to collective imaginings."

During this period, Penone carried out his work on traces and imprints obtained using various procedures, all based on contact. They range from the technique of the mold or cast to different actions based on exerting pressure. In ''Svolgere la propria pelle'' ("Developing One's Own Skin"), a 1970 artwork published the following year in the form of an artist's book, Penone recorded the boundary of his body with hundreds of photos taken by superimposing a sheet of glass on his skin.&lt;ref name="Gagosian"&gt;[https://gagosian.com/artists/giuseppe-penone/ "Giuseppe Penone"], Gagosian, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "The animal image, the imprint is involuntary culture. It has the intelligence of the material, a universal intelligence, an intelligence of the flesh of the material of man. The imprint of the whole epidermis of one's body, a leap into the air, a plunge into water, the body covered with earth. Developing one's skin against the air, water, earth, rock, walls, trees, dogs, handrails, windows, roads, hair, hats, handies, wings, doors, seats, stairs, clothes, books, eyes, sheep, mushrooms, grass, skin ... " wrote the artist, reflecting on the quantity of voluntary and involuntary signs that bodies disseminate and spread on different things: the neon lights in a gallery, the panes of glass in a window at the Kunsthalle in Kassel at "''Documenta 5''" in 1972, on a stone in ''Svolgere la propria pelle/pietra'' ("Developing One's Own Skin/Stone") of 1971, or on the fingers in ''Svolgere la propria pelle/dita'' ("Developing One's Own Skin/Finger") of the same year.

Penone's purpose is to produce the work starting from an image as automatic and unconscious as a fingerprint, and to make it conscious and voluntary through the irreplaceable action of drawing, which enlarges it and retraces it in all its art. Other examples are the cycles titled ''Pressione'' ("Pressure") begun in 1974 and ''Palpebre'' ("Eyelids") in 1975. The procedure adopted by the artist is articulated in different phases: making strips of adhesive tape adhere to his skin sprinkled with black, or pressure imprinting his own body or spreading a fine layer of resin on his eyelids and then photographing the image derived from the contact, projecting it enlarged onto paper or other surfaces, where it is transcribed in charcoal or pencil and with another act of contact, which the artist exerts by drawing. In some cases the work, which is the projection of the skin of an individual onto what is outside his body, takes on the dimension of an interior and the imprints traced on the walls of the space envelop the viewer, as in the installations he made for the exhibitions at the Kunstmuseum of Lucerne (1977), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1981), The National Gallery of Canada in [[Ottawa]] (1983), or the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville in Paris (1984).

The connection between the act of contact and the process of memory became more prominent in ''Vaso'' ("Vase") of 1975. This consisted of a terracotta vase from an archeological excavation and an expansion, in four bronze sculptures, of the fingerprints left on it by the potter. Here, for the first time, Penone worked in bronze. In 1978, Penone began a series of works in clay titled ''Soffio'' ("Breath").&lt;ref name="Breath"&gt;[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/penone-breath-5-t03420 "Breath 5"], Tate, Retrieved online 25 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With these works, he reproduced the volume of the breath against his body in the form of a large clay vase, making visible a performative gesture of the artist.&lt;ref name="Breath"/&gt; In 1979, he also produced ''Soffio di foglie'' ("Breath of Leaves"), in which the volume of the breath and the imprint of the body of the artist are impressed in a pile of leaves.&lt;ref name="Gagosian"/&gt;

With his ''Patate'' ("Potatoes") of 1977, Penone inserted himself into organic forms.&lt;ref name="Frieze"&gt;[https://frieze.com/article/giuseppe-penone "Giuseppe Penone"], Frieze, Retrieved 23 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Penone grew potatoes inside moulds of his face, so as to make them appear like parts of his face, such as his ears and his nose.&lt;ref name="Frieze"/&gt; This process was repeated again with his ''Zucche'' ("Pumpkins") of 1978, which saw Penone create bronzes sculptures from casts of pumpkins grown inside facial casts. This work was shown for the first time at his solo exhibition at the Halle für Internationale Neue Kunst of [[Zürich]] in 1980, and is always accompanied by the sculpture ''Nero d' Africa'' ("Black of Africa"), a block on marble partially sculpted in the negative and positive form of the artist's own figure.

===1980s===
In 1981 Penone began a series titled ''Essere Fiume'' ("Being the River").&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; For this series, Penone chose a rock from a river bed and then went to the source of the river to extract the same type of stone.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; The artist then painstakingly carved the stone to replicate the natural processes that have shaped the rock in the river, copying the ricochets and bumps as closely as possible.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; He then exhibits the two stones side by side.&lt;ref name="Gagosian"/&gt; In mimicking the work done by natural agents on the rock, Penone highlights the similarities between the action of the river and the action of the sculptor, thus identifying himself with the river.&lt;Ref name="Apollo"/&gt; He wrote: "Picking up a stone worn by the river, going back up the course of the river to discover the point in the hills from which the stone came and hewing a new block of stone from the mountain and then exactly replicating the stone picked up in the river in the new block of stone: this is to be a river. Producing a stone made of stone is perfect sculpture, a return to nature, it is a cosmic heritage, pure creation, the naturalness of a good sculpture acquires a cosmic value. Being a river is the true stone sculpture."

Some of Penone's works produced between 1979-1980 such as ''Albero d'acqua'' ("Tree of Water") and ''Colonna d'acqua'' ("Column of Water), all stem from the same logic of superimposing liquid on liquid vertically. "The condition of water is horizontality, the condition of verticality is sculpture, raising the water is a poetic gesture," he wrote in 1976. He sees all elements as fluid and what we would describe as hard or soft depends only on the state in which we find ourselves acting.

In ''Gesti vegetali'' ("Vegetation Gestures"), a series of sculptures which Penone began to work on in 1982, Penone "fossilized" the imprints of his hands on strips of clay stuck to a dummy that served as a frame. He then cast the clay in bronze using the lost-wax technique and completed the work by placing the casts next to each other so as to create the semblance of a human being. ''Gesti vegetali'' ("Vegetation Gestures") was first displayed in exhibitions at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Chicago]] and the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] in 1984. "Fossilized gestures that have been performed in a space," wrote the artist in 1977, "bring man closer to plants, which are compelled to live eternally under the burden of the gestures of their past." ln his installation in Basel's Merian Park in 1984, he began to engraft vegetation onto his sculptures, as appears in his solo exhibition at the [[Marian Goodman Gallery]] in New York in 1985.

Penone has made bronze trees which have been erected in various public spaces. One example is the ''Pozzo di Münster'' ("Well of Münster") created for the 1987 edition Skulpture Projects; on its trunk was the imprint of a hand which gushed water. Others were the ''Faggio di Otterloo'' ("Beech of Otterloo") conceived for the outdoor sculptures park, the Rijksmuseum Kroller-Müller in 1988, the ''Albero delle vocali'' ("Vowel Tree"), a sculpture thirty meters long placed horizontally in the [[Tuileries]] in [[Paris]], where it has been installed since 2000, or ''Elevazione'' ("Elevation") 01 2000-2001, a large tree raised off the ground in Rotterdam.

Many of Penone's works produced in the second hall of the 1980s are closely bound up with the idea of contact as a generator of memory and change. The series of works titled ''Verde del bosco'' ("Green of the Woods"), created between 1983 and 1987, are frottages on canvas of the trunks of forest trees, made using the leaves of the trees themselves. Sometimes the canvases are united in a single work with the trunks that produced them, or with ''Gesti vegetali'' ("Vegetation Gestures"), as in his installations in 1986 at the [[Museum of Grenoble]] in France and the Palais des Beaux-Arts in ''Charleroi''.

Like hair, nails are an extension of the body, the part used to investigate or attack matter, but they also the part where the materials from contact tends to sediment. Starting in 1987, Penone created large glass sculpture in the lorm of nails and places them in contact with different materials, piles of leaves, forest trees, logs and blocks of marble. They were the theme of the 1998 exhibition at the [[Musée Rodin]] in Paris.

ln the cycle of works titled ''Terre'' ("Lands") created starting from 1988, the earth sedimented in layers, as in its natural state, is enclosed in a transparent glass parallelepiped through which can be seen the imprint left by.a gesture of the artist, the upheaval in the soil which preserves the image of the hand that caused it.

===1990s onwards===
ln the personal exhibition presented at the Église Courmelois at Val-De-Vesle in 1991, Penone displayed the large sculpture titled ''Suture'' ("Sutures"), which he worked on between 1987 and 1991. ln it the enlarged negative of the image of a human brain is rendered by four jagged lines of steel that reproduce the points of contact between the four lobes, marking their boundaries and lines of contact with each other. A Y-shaped transparent glass tube containing soil constitutes the central element of the sculpture and raises the subject of the relationship between man and nature.

ln the large drawings titled ''Foglie'' ("Leaves"), the traces that a soft matter like the brain leaves on the skull are transposed to the images of leaves. ln the ''Anatomie'' ("Anatomies"), shown for the first time at the Musée d'Art Contemporain in [[Nîmes]] in 1993, the artist hewed into the surface of Carrara marble (much favored for statuary) to bring out the veining, which so closely resembles the vessels through which blood flows in living creatures.

ln the 1994 cycle of works titled Propagazione ("Propagation"), the concentric lines derived from the imprint of a finger expand into a system of waves. ln ''Sorgente di cristallo'' ("Crystal Spring") of 1996, the glass cast in which the water seems to be crystallized, is taken from a casting of a trunk. Again in ''Albero delle vertebre'' ("Tree of Vertebrae"), presented for the first time in a traveling show at the museums of [[Nîmes]], [[Tilburg]] and [[Trento]] between 1997 and 1998, the form of a tree trunk lives in the transparent material of crystal and it rises from forms in plaster created by enlarging the casts of a human skull.

''Respirare l'ombra'' ("Breathing the Shadow") is a dimly lit room lined with laurel leaves, where visual and tactile impressions combine with olfactory sensations. ln another installation, shown for the first time at the Galego Contemporary Art Center at [[Santiago de Compostela]] and then at the [[Palais des Papes]] in Avignon in 2000, in the centre of one of the walls there appears a gilt bronze lung, whose lobes are also modeled using laurel leaves.

ln the bronze sculptures titled ''Pelle di foglie'' ("Skin of Leaves"), 2000, the leaves seem the endings of a system of nerves or veins evoked by the densely interlacing stems. ln ''spoglia d'oro su spine d'acacia'' ("Golden Skin on Acacia Thorns") 01 2002, the imprint 01 lips is picked out in myriads of acacia thorns, so transforming the human trace into a natural landscape. At the same time it evokes the nerve endings of a mouth while, by contrast, stressing its sensitivity. The work forms part of a series made from acacia thorns applied to silk and sometimes associated with slabs of marble, whose veiningin relief is shown to match traces marked by the vegetation. An example is the work titled ''Pelle di marmo su spine d'acacia'' ("Marble Skin on Acacia Thorns"), exhibited in 2001 at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] of Paris and the Fujikawa Gallery in Osaka.

ln ''Pelle di cedro'' ("Cedar Skin") of 2002 exhibited for the first time in the anthological exhibition of Penone's work by the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris in 2004, an imprint of the bark of a tree is impressed on the cowhides tanned using traditional methods. The roughness of the bark transferred to the hides and displayed in negative resembles a pattern of veins, as in the ''Anatomie''. Bark also underlies the casts that appear in ''Lo spazio della scultura'' ("The Space of Sculpture") an installation presented at the recent exposition at the Studio per l'Arte Contemporanea Tucci Russo at Torre Pellice and the Museum Kurhaus Kleve between 2006 and 2007.

"The structure of fluids is the same whatever the element. A watercourse, a growing tree and a pathway have similar forms" writes Penone of the work titled ''Albero giardino'' ("Tree Garden"), produced for a former railroad site in Turin in 2002. ln this outdoor work, the human action, hence culture, is compared to the force of natural elements and expressed in the design of a path traced by the vegetation, whose outline represents the growth of a tree.

Between 2003 and 2007, Penone was involved in the production of a large scale installation of sculptures for the seventeenth-century [[Palazzo di Venaria]] in [[Piedmont]].&lt;ref name="Nasher"&gt;[http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/learn/research/articles-publications/article?id=10 "The Garden of Fluid Sculptures"], Nasher Sculpture Center, Retrieved online 23 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This work, titled "The Garden of Fluid Sculptures," includes fourteen sculptures made in bronze, wood, and marble and spread over several acres of the outdoor gardens.&lt;ref name="Nasher"/&gt; In 2007 Penone was also invited to the Venice Biennale where he set up an installation for the new opening of the Padiglione Italiano.

In 2011 Penone participated in the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] "Galleria Italia," which included his work ''Repeating the Forest'' (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="AGO"/&gt; With this work Penone had carefully removed rings of growth from a fir tree to reveal its former young shape hidden beneath decades of growth, and ''Versailles Cedar, 2000-2003''.&lt;ref name="AGO"/&gt; "Penone arrives at these forms by carving the tree trunk leaving the knots in place until they emerge as limbs, revealing the sapling within."&lt;ref&gt;ArtMattersBlog ''Meet the artist Giuseppe Penone'' [http://artmatters.ca/wp/2010/03/tomorrow-meet-the-artist-giuseppe-penone/], which features a photo of Penone working on ''Versailles Cedar''&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this work, he stated "My artwork shows, with the language of sculpture, the essence of matter and tries to reveal with the work, the hidden life within." &lt;ref name="AGO"/&gt;

===Penone in Arte Povera===

Since 1969 Penone has been one of the leading representatives of [[Arte Povera]], the critical theory coined by [[Germano Celant]] in 1967 and based on the work of a number of Italian artists, including [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] and [[Gilberto Zorio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madrenapoli.it/en/arte-povera-piu-azioni-povere-1968/ "Arte Povera piu Azioni Povere 1968"], Madre Museum, Retrieved online 18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists rejected traditional artistic languages. The appearance of Penone in this group of artists coincided with the emergence in the critical elaborations of the "magical and wonder-arousing value of the natural elements".&lt;ref&gt;G. Celant, ''Arte Povera'', Mazzotta, Milan 1969&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a time when dialogue and debate with the coeval international avantgardes was becoming most intense, conducted through a series of group surveys in which Penone took part. These events included ''Konzeption-Conception'' at the Schloss Morsbroich in [[Leverkusen]] in 1969, ''conceptual art arte povera land art'' at the Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna in Turin and ''Information'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, in 1970.

The "'''Great Moon Hoax'''" refers to a series of six articles that were published in ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a New York newspaper, beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and even civilization on the [[Moon]]. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir [[John Herschel]], one of the best-known [[astronomer]]s of that time.

The story was advertised on August 21, 1835, as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from ''[[Edinburgh Courant|The Edinburgh Courant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maliszewski, Paul. "Paper Moon," ''Wilson Quarterly''. Winter 2005. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The first in a series of six was published four days later on August 25.

==Article==
[[File:1836 the-great-moon-hoax-new-inhabitants-of-the-moon.png|thumb|right|220px|Portrait of a man-bat ("''Vespertilio-homo''"), from an edition of the Moon series published in [[Naples]]]]

The headline read:

{{cquote|
&lt;center&gt;GREAT ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;LATELY MADE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;BY SIR JOHN HERSCHEL, L.L.D. F.R.S. &amp;c.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''At the [[Cape of Good Hope]]'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[From Supplement to the [[Edinburgh]] Journal of Science]&lt;/center&gt;
}}

The articles described fantastic animals on the Moon, including [[bison]], [[goats]], [[unicorn]]s, [[bipedal]] tail-less [[beavers]] and [[bat]]-like winged humanoids ("''Vespertilio-homo''") who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with "an immense [[telescope]] of an entirely new principle."

The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and [[amanuensis]] of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious.

Eventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the [[Sun]] causing the lens to act as a "[[burning glass]]," setting fire to the observatory.&lt;ref name="AsimovGunn1975"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunn |first1=James E. |authorlink1=James Gunn (author) |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |authorlink2=Isaac Asimov |title=Alternate worlds: the illustrated history of science fiction |date=1975 |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=0-89104-049-8 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Authorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871),&lt;ref Name="Deseret"&gt;{{Cite news |title=They Formed A Pair |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xaZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hkIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6760,5192821 |newspaper=[[Deseret News|The Deseret Weekly]] |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company |location=Salt Lake City, UT |date=May 13, 1893 |page=665 |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/locke_richard_adams |title=Locke, Richard Adams |first1=John |last1=Clute |first2=John |last2=Eggeling |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for ''The Sun''. Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper ''New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Matthew |date=2008 |title=The Sun and the Moon |location=New York |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |page=274 |isbn=978-0-465-00257-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rumours persisted that others were involved. Two other men have been noted in connection with the [[hoax]]: [[Joseph Nicollet|Jean-Nicolas Nicollet]],&lt;ref Name="Deseret" /&gt; a French astronomer travelling in America at the time (though he was in Mississippi, not New York, when the Moon-hoax issues appeared), and [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', a literary magazine. However, there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax.

Assuming that Richard A. Locke was the author, his intentions were probably, first, to create a sensational story which would increase sales of ''The Sun'', and, second, to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published. For instance, in 1824, [[Franz von Gruithuisen|Franz von Paula Gruithuisen]], professor of Astronomy at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]], had published a paper titled "Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings." Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface, which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones. He also observed lines and geometrical shapes, which he felt indicated the existence of walls, roads, fortifications, and cities.

However, a more direct object of Locke's satire was Rev. [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], who was known as "The Christian Philosopher" after the title of his first book.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rh4PAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=thomas+dick+christian+philosopher&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Christian Philosopher]''&lt;/ref&gt; Dick had computed that the [[Solar System]] contained 21,891,974,404,480 (21.9 trillion) inhabitants. In fact, the Moon alone, by his count, would contain 4,200,000,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dick |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Dick (scientist) |title=Celestial Scenery; or, The Wonders of the Planetary System Displayed: Illustrating the Perfections of Deity and a Plurality of Worlds |url=https://archive.org/download/celestialscener00dick/celestialscener00dick.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |origyear=First published London 1837; New York 1838 |date=1845 |publisher=Edward C. Biddle |location=Philadelphia |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were enormously popular in the [[United States]], his fans including intellectual [[wikt:luminaries|luminaries]] such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

==Reaction and effect==
According to legend, ''The Sun''{{'}}s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before, thereby establishing ''The Sun'' as a successful paper. However, the degree to which the hoax increased the paper's circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event. It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and, even then, the newspaper did not issue a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Doris V. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1972207.htm Thomas Low Nichols, Poe, and the 'Balloon Hoax'"] collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. V, no. 2. December 1972. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel was initially amused by the hoax, noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting. He became annoyed later when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work "[[The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall]]."  His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke.  He later published "[[The Balloon-Hoax]]" in the same newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-great-moon-hoax-180-years-ago?linkId=16545579|title=The Great Moon Hoax – History in the Headlines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe had published his own Moon hoax in late June 1835, two months before the similar Locke Moon hoax, in the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' entitled "Hans Phaall – A Tale," later republished as "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall." The story was reprinted in the ''[[New York Transcript]]'' on September 2–5, 1835, under the headline "Lunar Discoveries, Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall." Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a hot-air balloon, in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to earth. The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account. Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder. In 1846, Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series "The Literati of New York City" which appeared in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]''.

The hoax, as well as Poe's "Hans Pfaall", are mentioned by characters in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.

Nate DiMeo's historical podcast ''[[The Memory Palace]]'' dedicated an episode to the Great Moon Hoax entitled "The Moon in the Sun."&lt;ref name="Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://thememorypalace.us/2010/01/episode-24-the-moon-in-the-sun/ |title=Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun |website=The Memory Palace |publisher=[[WordPress]] |host=DiMeo, Nate |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''handicraft''', sometimes more precisely expressed as '''artisanal handicraft''' or '''handmade''', is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. It is a traditional main sector of [[craft]], and applies to a wide range of creative and [[design]] activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, etc. One of the world's oldest handicraft is [[Dhokra]]; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. Usually the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic.Handicraft industries are those that produces things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality.Machines are not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On State Street, "Maker" Movement Arrives |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/make_haven/id_46594 |date=April 30, 2012 |author=Thomas MacMillan |work=New Haven Independent |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |title=Gaia Handicraft |accessdate=November 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mEttDude?url=http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |archivedate=November 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invent To Learn|last=Martinez|first=Sylvia|publisher=Constructing Modern Knowledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9891511-0-8|location=Torrance, CA|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective terms for handicrafts include '''artisanry''', '''handicrafting''', '''crafting''', and '''handicraftsmanship'''.
The term '''arts and crafts''' is also applied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists' and children's output rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not formal, and the term is easily confused with the [[Arts and Crafts]] design movement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.

Handicrafting has its roots in the [[rural crafts]]—the material-goods necessities—of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, while others are modern inventions, or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.

Many handicrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even [[Upcycling|upcycle]] industrial materials. The individual [[artisan]]ship of a handicrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by [[mass production]] or machines are not handicraft goods.

Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally.  Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience, but can be learned by virtually anyone.

Like [[folk art]], handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in [[craftivism]]. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.

==The Arts and Crafts movement in the West==
{{Main|Arts and Crafts}}
The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement originated as a late 19th-century design reform and social movement principally in Europe, North America and Australia, and continues today. Its proponents are motivated by the ideals of movement founders such as [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]], who proposed that in pre-industrial societies, such as the European [[Middle Ages]], people had achieved [[Catharsis|fulfillment]] through the creative process of handicrafts. This was held up in contrast to what was perceived to be the alienating effects of industrial labor.
[[File:WPA Crafts Class.gif|thumb|left|Works Progress Administration, Crafts Class, 1935.]]
These activities were called ''[[craft]]s'' because originally many of them were professions under the [[guild]] system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master craftsman, and refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the increasing mechanisation of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today many handicrafts are increasingly seen, especially when no longer the mainstay of a [[Tradesman|formal vocational trade]], as a form of [[hobby]], [[folk art]] and sometimes even [[fine art]].

The term ''handicrafts'' can also refer to the products themselves of such artisanal efforts, that require specialized knowledge, may be highly technical in their execution, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve [[manual labor]] or a [[blue-collar]] work ethic, are accessible to the general public, and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of Western "fine art" tradition, such as [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[textiles]], [[metal]] and [[wood]].  These products are produced within a specific [[community of practice]], and while they mostly differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries often overlap, resulting in hybrid objects.  Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive handicrafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one's home.

==In modern education==
[[File:Buell Childrens Museum Art Room by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|At the [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], children and their guardians partake in "arts and crafts" (i.e. handicrafts).]]
Simple "arts and crafts" projects are a common elementary and middle school activity in both mainstream and alternative education systems around the world.

In some of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, more advanced handicrafts form part of the formal, compulsory school curriculum, and are collectively referred to as ''[[sloyd|slöjd]]'' in Swedish, and ''käsityö'' or ''veisto'' in Finnish. Students learn how to work with mainly metal, textile and wood, not for professional training purposes as in American [[vocational education|vocational–technical schools]], but with the aim to develop children's and teens' practical skills, such as everyday problem-solving ability, tool use, and understanding of the materials that surround us for economical, cultural and environmental purposes.

Secondary schools and college and university art departments increasingly provide elective options for more handicraft-based arts, in addition to formal "[[fine art]]s", a distinction that continues to fade throughout the years, especially with the rise of [[studio craft]], i.e. the use of traditional handicrafting techniques by professional fine artists.

Many [[community center]]s and schools run evening or day classes and workshops, for adults and children, offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time.

'''''Hoodlum''''' is a 1997 American [[crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] that gives a fictionalized account of the gang war between the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian]]/[[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mafia]] alliance and the Black gangsters of [[Harlem]] that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The film concentrated on [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Tim Roth]]), and [[Lucky Luciano]] ([[Andy García]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0119311|title=Hoodlum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=March 2015}}

After being paroled from [[Sing Sing]], Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) returns to [[Harlem]] to resume his old life. He is welcomed back by his cousin, Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride) as well as Stephanie "Madame Queen" St. Clair ([[Cicely Tyson]]), the monarch reigning over the [[Numbers game|numbers racket]] in Harlem. The psychopathic Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] associate who reports to mob boss Charles "Lucky" Luciano (Andy Garcia) runs the numbers rackets in downtown New York. His gang has been crowding into Harlem, terrorizing residents to only play the numbers with his operation.

While hanging on the stoop one afternoon with Illinois and his girlfriend Mary, Bumpy meets one of Mary's friends, Francine (Vanessa Williams). She and Illinois talk trash to each other, with her disapproving of the 'numbers' rackets Illinois is involved in and him defending it as the only way to make ends meet in the Depression. Bumpy introduces himself to her and is obviously interested. They meet again in a nightclub and dance together. Bumpy walks Francine home and they debate the effect of gambling in Harlem on its citizens. At her door, she says that he could do anything he wanted. He responds that he has written some poetry and then recites a poem to her, about her beautiful eyes.

Dutch Schultz asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz uses to terrorize her customers. Later a hit is ordered by Dutch on the Queen; however Whispers ([[Paul Benjamin]]) and Bumpy repel the attackers. Using his friendship with corrupt Captain Foley ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), of the New York City Police Department, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs Johnson to avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent.

Bumpy and Dutch start a devastating war with each other. In one of Dutch's attempts on Bumpy's life, Dutch employs two big hit men. They break into Bumpy's home, killing two of his bodyguards and making their way up to the bedroom, where Bumpy and Francine are. They attack Bumpy and Francine in the bathroom. One of them is killed and the scene culminates in Francine having to shoot the other just as he is about to kill Bumpy. They hold each other on the floor of the bathroom, covered in blood. More and more people are killed, including the sixteen-year-old Tyrone, who begged Bumpy to let him become a numbers runner for him.

One afternoon, Bumpy and Francine are having a banana split in his favorite ice cream parlor. Bumpy notices in the nick of time that the split has almonds on it, which he never orders. Francine is already to dig in when Bumpy stops her. Suddenly, the tension mounts, Bumpy's men rush all the regular citizens out of the parlor and pull down the shades. After questioning the terrified owner, Bumpy finds out that it was the new boy, Jimmie, who made the split, which has been poisoned. Bumpy invites him over to the table where he asks him to eat the split. The kid makes all kinds of excuses and is also terrified. After more threatening, he confesses it was one of Bumpy's closest men, Vallie, who set Bumpy up. Bumpy sends Francine out of the parlor and forces the kid to eat the poisoned ice cream. Bumpy, Illinois, Whispers and two other of his men take Vallie to a private pool hall and question Vallie about the set-up. Vallie weeps, confessing it was all for the money and begs for his life. Bumpy notices a nice ring on Vallie's finger and asks him if he bought it with the money, which Vallie vehemently denies. Eventually, everyone walks out except Whispers, who cuts Vallie's throat with a straight razor.

Bumpy and his gang show up at the Cotton Club in downtown New York. This is in Dutch's territory and does not allow black people in except as entertainers. Dutch is holding court. The place goes silent as Bumpy tells Dutch that he knows all about his operation and if Dutch doesn't shut it down, Bumpy will do it for him. Dutch mentions Vallie and Bumpy replies that Vallie won't be able to comment anymore but left a souvenir for Dutch. He puts a handkerchief on the table that contains a bloody finger, with a fancy ring on it. It nearly comes to a shoot-out, with cooler heads holding Dutch. Bumpy and his gang leave. When Dutch continues terrorizing uptown Harlem, Bumpy engages an explosives expert to rig a bomb. He and Illinois manage to infiltrate one of Dutch's liquor warehouses as delivery boys and just manage to get away before the whole building explodes.

In the meantime, Dutch and his men have broken into Mary's house (Illinois' girlfriend). Dutch hits and threatens her, asking her where Illinois is. One of his right hand men, Bub (Clarence Williams III) says she doesn't know anything and he doesn't have to do this. Dutch tells him to toughen up. After blowing up the warehouse, Illinois makes his way back to Mary's to find her dead.

Bumpy arrives home where Francine tells him that she is leaving him. He is enraged and starts throwing the fancy dresses and jewels that he bought at her. She yells that she didn't want any of them and that she doesn't know him anymore, that he is no longer the good man with whom she had fallen in love.

Devastated by Mary's death, Illinois gets drunk and tells Bumpy that he's changed, that he is as bad as Dutch now. They have it out; Illinois says he's finished with Bumpy and staggers out. As he's walking down the street, Captain Foley and Bub Hewlett ([[Clarence Williams III]]) see him, kidnap him and chain him up in a machinery room. Foley beats him and wants to torture him for information. Hewlett says Illinois isn't going to talk and wants him let go. He leaves but Foley kills him using a corkscrew. Eager to end the war between each faction, Luciano decides to try and make the Schultz and Johnson come to an agreement, although neither wants to compromise.

Later that evening, word comes to the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the warehouse where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets in his mouth and a suitcase with "No More Secrets" written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.
 
Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu ([[Ed O'Ross]]) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.
 
The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings "Amazing Grace" while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that "the film is being marketed as a violent action picture, and in a sense, it is" and that director [[Bill Duke]] having made "a historical drama as much as a thriller, and his characters reflect a time when Harlem seemed poised on the brink of better things, and the despair of the postwar years was not easily seen on its prosperous streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | date = August 27, 1997 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970827/REVIEWS/708270302 | title = Hoodlum :: rogerebert.com | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyewon pungsokdo''' is an album of the [[genre paintings]] (''pungsokhwa'' or ''pungsokdo'') drawn by the Korean painter [[Shin Yunbok]] during the late [[Joseon dynasty]]. It was named after Shin's [[pen name]], '''Hyewon''', and comprises 30 paintings in total.

In 1930, [[Jeon Hyeopil]] (전형필:全鎣弼), later the founder of the [[Gansong Art Museum]], purchased it from an antique dealer in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]] and newly mounted the album. [[Oh Sechang]] (오세창), who was a journalist and pro-independence activist, wrote the subtitles and postface for the album. ''Hyewon pungsokdo'' is designated as the 135th [[National treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of South Korea]] and is held in the collection of the [[Gansong Art Museum]] located in [[Seongbuk-gu]], [[Seoul]], South Korea.&lt;!--Is it on display there or kept in a vault?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="376618">'''Fairy tales''' are stories that range from those originating in folklore to more modern stories defined as literary fairy tales. Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], [[fable]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], and [[legend]]s, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs "from an oral folk tale", written by "a single identifiable author", which can be characterised as "simple and anonymous", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to [[Oral tradition|folktale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, xv&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the first known appearances of various [[superhero]] [[fictional characters]] and teams.

A superhero (also known as a "super hero" or "super-hero") is a [[fictional character]] "of unprecedented physical prowess dedicated to acts of derring-do in the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;''National Periodical Publications v. Empire Comics'', [[New York Court of Appeals]], April 21, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the debut of Superman in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, stories of superheroes — ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas — have dominated [[American comic book]]s and crossed over into other [[mass media|media]]. A [[female]] superhero is sometimes called a "superheroine."

By most definitions, characters need not have actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although sometimes terms such as "costumed crimefighters"&lt;ref&gt;Per [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/mar/17/v_vendetta_s_subversive/?arts ''Lawrence Journal-World'' (March 17, 2006): "'V for Vendetta' is S for Subversive", by Jon Niccum],  [http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/00/04710246/0471024600.pdf "The Dark Knight: Batman &amp;mdash; A NonSuper Superhero"], [http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ps2/previews/batman-begins-2bae56.html GameSpot: PS2 Games: ''Batman Begins''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625170802/http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ps2/previews/batman-begins-2bae56.html |date=2007-06-25 }}, [http://members.fortunecity.com/srca1943/SpotlightComicsAnnual2.html ''Spotlight Comics Annual'' #2 (May 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619133829/http://members.fortunecity.com/srca1943/SpotlightComicsAnnual2.html |date=2008-06-19 }}; [http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Scarecrow_of_Romney_Marsh.html "The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Characters: Rev. Dr. Christopher Syn, the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (one of the world's first masked crime-fighters)" (no date)], and other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; are used to refer to those without such powers who have many other common traits of superheroes.

The folkloric Spring-heeled Jack came to be featured in a series of Penny Dreadfuls as a villain.  However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was reinvented as a crime-fighter with a disguise, secret lair, and gadgets, hallmarks of superheroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcatpress.co.uk/Spring_Heeled_Jack_Page.htm ''The Complete Spring Heeled Jack Page'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-figurative art''' describes an [[expressionist]] revival in modern form of [[figurative art]].  The term [[wikt:neo-|neo]] and [[Figurative art|figurative]] emerged in the 1960s in [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and [[Spain]] to represent a new form of figurative art.

==History==
Conductor Armand Diangienda founded the orchestra in 1994 after losing his job as an [[airline pilot]], naming it after his grandfather, religious leader [[Simon Kimbangu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsioulcas  |first=Anastasia |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/03/06/148075689/kinshasa-symphony-an-ode-to-musical-joy-in-central-africa |title='Kinshasa Symphony': An Ode To Musical Joy In Central Africa|publisher=NPR|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its conception, the group had only twelve amateur musicians that shared instruments and often used common materials as makeshift instrument parts. The group eventually grew to the size of about 200 amateur musicians and performers consisting of a full orchestra and [[choir]].

The orchestra gained international attention when German filmmakers [[Martin Baer]] and [[Claus Wischmann]] created the documentary ''[[Kinshasa Symphony]]'' (2010) depicting the plight of the orchestra and its members in poverty stricken Kinshasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan  |first=Frances |url=http://soundandmusic.org/features/sound-film/films-sound-kinshasa-symphony |title=Films on sound: Kinshasa Symphony|publisher=Sound and Music|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 it was announced that Diangienda was to become an honorary member of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], an award previously bestowed on such famous musicians as [[Mendelssohn]], [[Rossini]], [[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Stravinsky]].&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;

The '''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg''' (Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra) is a French orchestra based in [[Strasbourg]].  It is one of the two permanent orchestras of the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] (the other being the [[Orchestre symphonique de Mulhouse]]). The orchestra's current principal venue is the [[Palais de la musique et des congrès]] 'Pierre Pflimlin ' (PMC Pierre-Pflimlin, or PMC).

The orchestra was founded in 1855.  Between 1871 and 1918, and 1940 and 1944, the orchestra had been a [[Germany|German]] one, resulting from conflicts between France and Germany over the [[Alsace]] region.  In 1994, the orchestra acquired the official title of ''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg – orchestre national''.  The orchestra currently holds 110 permanent musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg - orchestre national|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/biographies/ops_vGB.pdf|publisher=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Composers-in-residence included the French composers [[Jean-Louis Agobet]] and [[Philippe Manoury]], the Finnish composer [[Kaija Saariaho]] and the American composer [[John Corigliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les compositeurs en résidence|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/compositeurs-residence.php|website=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past music directors and chief conductors have included [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Ernest Bour]], [[Jan Latham-Koenig]], [[Charles Bruck]] and [[Alain Lombard]].  [[Marc Albrecht]] became artistic advisor of the orchestra in 2005, and music director in 2008.  Albrecht and the orchestra have recorded commercially for [[PentaTone Classics|PENTATONE]], including orchestral lieder of [[Alban Berg]], and piano concertos by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/04/schumann-dvorak-piano-concerto | title=Schumann: Piano Concerto; Dvorák: Piano Concerto: Helmchen/Strasbourg PO/Albrecht | work=The Guardian | date=2009-12-04 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Albrecht concluded his tenure in 2011.  In January 2011, the orchestra announced the appointment of Marko Letonja as its next music director, effective with the 2012-2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Danièle Leonard | url=http://alsace.france3.fr/info/marko-letonja-nouveau-directeur-musical-de-l-ops-66965043.html | title=Marko Letonja, nouveau directeur musical de l'OPS | work=France3 TV (Alsace) | date=2011-01-20 | accessdate=2011-09-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331105752/http://alsace.france3.fr/info/marko-letonja-nouveau-directeur-musical-de-l-ops-66965043.html | archivedate=2012-03-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

The '''Praemium Imperiale''' (lit. "World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu", {{lang-ja|高松宮殿下記念世界文化賞}}, ''Takamatsu no miya denka kinen sekai bunka-shō'') is an international art prize awarded since 1989 by the [[Imperial family of Japan]] on behalf of the Japan Art Association in the fields of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[film|theatre/film]].&lt;ref name="Goldberger"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=In 1994, What Draws Eyes?

The prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions to the development, promotion and progress of the arts.

==Information==

The Praemium Imperiale is awarded in the memory of His Imperial Highness [[Prince Takamatsu]] (1905–1987), younger brother of [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] who reigned from 1926 through 1989. Prince Takamatsu was famous for his longtime support of the development, promotion and progress of arts in the world.

The laureates are announced each September; the prize presentation ceremony and related events are held in [[Tokyo, Japan]], each November. The prize presentation ceremony is held in the presence of His Imperial Highness [[Prince Hitachi]], President of the Japan Art Association, at the [http://www.meijikinenkan.gr.jp Meiji Kinenkan] in Tokyo. Prince Hitachi presents the prizes to the selected laureates. The prize consists of a gold medal and 15 million Japanese yen, and was created by the [[Fujisankei Communications Group]], which pays the expenses of around $3 million per year.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberger" /&gt;

The laureates are annually recommended by international advisers, and decided by an anonymous committee of the Japan Art Association.&lt;ref name="Goldberger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisors|publisher=Official website|url=http://www.praemiumimperiale.org/eg/aboutus/advisors.html|accessdate=January 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020306122558/http://www.praemiumimperiale.org/eg/aboutus/advisors.html|archivedate=March 6, 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advisers include [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[William H.

Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press}} was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement.&lt;!-- Please do NOT add "mathematician". Despite the famous theorem that now bears his name, scholars dispute whether the historical Pythagoras was involved in mathematics at all. Please read the rest of the lead and the "Attributed discoveries" section for further information. Thank you. --&gt; His political and religious teachings were well known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included [[vegetarianism]], although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. Following Croton's decisive victory over [[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"){{efn|[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].

Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

The Greek poets [[Ion of Chios]] ({{circa|480|421&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) and [[Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa|493|432&amp;nbsp;BC}}) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=14–15}} The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] ({{circa|484|420&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}),{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} who describes him as "not the most insignificant" of Greek sages&lt;ref&gt;4. 95. &lt;/ref&gt; and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain [[immortality]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=88}} The [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] [[rhetoric]]ian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} [[Aristotle]] wrote a treatise ''On the Pythagoreans'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;He alludes to it himself, ''Met.'' i. 5. p. 986. 12, ed. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it may be preserved in the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]''. Aristotle's disciples [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] also wrote on the same subject.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the [[Ancient Greece#Roman Greece|Roman period]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} by which point, according to the German classicist [[Walter Burkert]], "the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone."{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} Three [[Biography#Historical biography|lives]] of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The two later lives were written by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} and were partially intended as polemics against the [[rise of Christianity]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

[[Herodotus]], [[Isocrates]], and other early writers agree that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} and that he was born on the Greek island of [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=12}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=9}} His father is said to have been a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Clemens von Alexandria: ''Stromata'' I 62, 2–3, cit. {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teoyAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=neanthes%20of%20cyzicus%20pythagoras%20tyre&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Iamblichus and the Foundations of Late Platonism|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Brill|year=2012|editor1=Eugene V.

During Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]], and for its riotous festival culture.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=45–47}} It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian [[natural philosophy]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}} He was a contemporary of the philosophers [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and the historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], all of whom lived in [[Miletus]], across the sea from Samos.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}

===Alleged travels===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of [[Archaic Greece]] was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=22–23}} By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writer [[Antiphon (writer)|Antiphon]], who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work ''On Men of Outstanding Merit'', used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] from the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]] himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at [[Thebes, Egypt|Diospolis]] (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.&lt;ref name="Porphyry6"&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} The [[Middle Platonist]] biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|46|120&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}) writes in his treatise ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]'' that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (meanwhile [[Solon]] received lectures from a [[Sonchis of Sais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|150|215&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=no}}), "Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as [[Plato]] of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]."{{sfn|Press|2003|page=83}} Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. Antiphon. ap. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28–9; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 27; Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the [[Magi]] in [[Persia]] or even from [[Zoroaster]] himself.&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited [[Crete]], where he went to the [[Mount Ida|Cave of Ida]] with [[Epimenides]].&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"/&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns are reputed to have taught Pythagoras [[arithmetic]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns to have taught him astronomy.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the [[Jews]] as well.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Contradicting all these reports, the novelist [[Antonius Diogenes]], writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by [[Dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The third-century AD [[Sophist]] [[Philostratus]] claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sages in [[India]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}}

Ancient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Some identify [[:fr:Hermodamas|Hermodamas of Samos]] as a possible tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2, Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of rival of the poet [[Homer]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Others credit [[Bias of Priene]], Thales,&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 9"&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Anaximander]] (a pupil of Thales).&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Other traditions claim the mythic bard [[Orpheus]] as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The Neoplatonists wrote of a "sacred discourse" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the [[Doric Greek]] dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at [[Leibethra]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and from other religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, [[Pherecydes of Syros]] is mentioned most often.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus and others in Diogenes Laërtius, i. 118, 119; Cicero, ''de Div.'' i. 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Apollonius Paradoxographus]], a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgic]] ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher [[Nicomachus]], tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of [[Delos]], Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Duris of Samos|Duris]], the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met [[Thales of Miletus]], who would have been around fifty-four years older than him. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer,&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl B. |url=https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known for a [[Thales' Theorem|special case]] of the [[inscribed angle theorem]]. Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of [[Samos]], is situated in the Northeast [[Aegean Sea]] not far from [[Miletus]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}} Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from [[Aristoxenus]] (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his [[moral]] doctrines from the [[Pythia|Delphic priestess]] [[Themistoclea]].&lt;ref name="Laertiusviii18"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''], viii. 1, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""Ellen Waithe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x7ngECDpxmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Mary Ellen Waithe, ''Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.–500 A.D.'', p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Malone |first=John C. |title=Psychology: Pythagoras to present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Qa6cMQj8AC&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01296-6 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry agrees with this assertion,&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41.&lt;/ref&gt; but calls the priestess Aristoclea (''Aristokleia'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Ménage]]: ''The history of women philosophers''.

Porphyry repeats an account from [[Antiphon]], who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the "semicircle".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=22}} His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the [[Tyrant#Historical forms|tyranny]] of [[Polycrates]] in Samos,&lt;ref name=Boyer /&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras "did not indulge in the pleasures of love"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=58}} and that he cautioned others to only have sex "whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]], a lady of [[Crete]] and the daughter of Pythenax{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and had several children with her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named [[Telauges]] and [[Arignote]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and a daughter named Myia,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} who "took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions none of these children{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

The wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and quotes several opinions attributed to her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} These writings are now known to be [[pseudepigraphica]]l.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

===Death===
Pythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of [[Sybaris]] in 510 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a [[Greek democracy|democratic constitution]], which the Pythagoreans rejected.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} The supporters of democracy, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} The building was apparently set on fire,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} and many of the assembled members perished;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} only the younger and more active members managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255–259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54–57; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of [[Locris]], where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} They reached the city of [[Metapontum]], where they took shelter in the temple of the [[Muses]] and died there of starvation after forty days without food.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=278}} Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.{{sfn|Simoons|1998|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}

==Teachings==
===Metempsychosis===
[[File:Cropped image of Pythagoras from Raphael's School of Athens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Scene from Raphael's School of Athens showing Pythagoras as a balding, bearded man writing in a book with a quill.

Averroes, shown as a stereotypical Middle Easterner with a mustache and wearing a turban, peers over his left shoulder while another bearded, balding philosopher in classical garb, probably Anaxagoras, peers over his right shoulder, taking notes into a much smaller notepad.

Although the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=5–6}} it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=9–11}} Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been ''[[metempsychosis]]'',{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=300–301}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} the belief that all [[soul]]s are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}} This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36, comp. Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 3; Herodotus, ii. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}} Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=25}}

[[Empedocles]] alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=12}} Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from [[Heraclides Ponticus]] that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–167}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 26; Pausanias, ii. 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 5; Horace, ''Od.'' i. 28,1. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these lives was as [[Aethalides]] the son of [[Hermes]], who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–165}} Next, he was incarnated as [[Euphorbus]], a minor hero from the [[Trojan War]] briefly mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]''.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=165–166}} He then became the philosopher [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]],{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from [[Delos]].{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} One of his past lives, as reported by [[Dicaearchus]], was as a beautiful courtesan.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}

===Mysticism===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]",{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven [[Muse]]s were actually the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] singing together.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} In his philosophical dialogue [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], [[Aristotle]] has his literary double say:

{{quote|When Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, "to observe the heavens," and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web|author1=D.

Pythagoras was said to have practiced [[divination]] and [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Divin.'' i. 3, 46; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the visits to various places in Greece—[[Delos]], [[Sparta]], [[Phlius]], [[Crete]], etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 25; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3, 13; Cicero, ''Tusc. Qu.'' v. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} They believed that all things were made of numbers.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=265}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=27}} The number one (the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all things{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} and the number two (the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]) represented matter.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} The number three was an "ideal number" because it had a beginning, middle, and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] were [[masculine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=467}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=170}}

Ten was regarded as the "perfect number"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was "so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it]," that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|page=66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=28}}

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus of Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87–88}} In his landmark study ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, [[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}} but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=465}}

{{main|Pythagoreanism}}
Both [[Plato]] and [[Isocrates]] state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', 600a, Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=168}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=277}} The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a "school",&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Scholars Press.; D. J. O'Meara, (1989), ''Pythagoras Revived. Mathematics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity'', pages 35–40. Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Iamblichus, in particular, presents the "Pythagorean Way of Life" as a pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own time.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}}

Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the ''mathematikoi'' ("learners") and the ''akousmatikoi'' ("listeners").{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The ''akousmatikoi'' are traditionally identified by scholars as "old believers" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} whereas the ''mathematikoi'' are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8, 91, 141&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long [[spondee]]s and the boys' "raging willfulness" was quelled.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of [[physical exercise]];{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} therapeutic [[dance|dancing]], daily morning walks along [[scenic route]]s, and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=33–34}}

Pythagorean teachings were known as "symbols" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;Scholion ad Aristophanes, ''Nub.'' 611; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} during which they were required to remain silent.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} seventeen of whom are women.{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of [[Neopythagoreanism]].{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|pages=xvi–xvii}}

Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=30–31}} In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} which he publicly exhibited at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} and showed to [[Abaris the Hyperborean]] as proof of his identity as the "Hyperborean Apollo".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=47}} He is also said to have borne a golden [[wreath]] atop his head{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} and to have worn [[trousers]] after the fashion of the [[Thrace|Thracians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable [[self-control]];{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} he was always cheerful,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} but "abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}} and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=60–61}} Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} and leading them to trust him with their wives.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}}

Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–22}} classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including [[Pythagorean theorem|his famous theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12; Plutarch, ''Non posse suav. vivi sec.

Nat.'' ii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient Greek medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12, 14, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=26–27}} a theorem in geometry that states that "in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides"{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}—that is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of [[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] centuries before Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, 462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=6–7}} but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}} Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he&amp;mdash;or his students&amp;mdash;may have constructed the first [[Mathematical proof|proof]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=33}} Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.{{efn|There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone.

{{See also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} 
According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} However, this legend is demonstrably false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}}

===In astronomy===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary [[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and the first to identify the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning star]] and the [[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306–308}} and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a [[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.{{sfn|Dicks|1970|page=68}}

{{See also|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, [[Phlius]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] during the early fourth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=48–49}} Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher [[Archytas]] was highly influential on the politics of the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in Magna Graecia.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–43}} He was a close friend of Plato{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–40}} and he is quoted in Plato's ''Republic''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=40, 44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' VII, 530d&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=1}} Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have a strong "Pythagorean coloring",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}} are extremely Pythagorean in character.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}

According to [[R. M. Hare]], Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' may be partially based on the "tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers" established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world"{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} and it is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphicism|Orphism]].{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} The historian of philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33–37}} He concludes that "I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought."{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123–124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] philosophers such as [[Eudorus of Alexandria|Eudorus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] hailed the rise of a "new" Pythagoreanism in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=124}} At around the same time, [[Neopythagoreanism]] became prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} The first-century AD philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the soul as a "kind of mathematical harmony."{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist [[Nicomachus]] likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} [[Numenius of Apamea]] interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=126–127}}

Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}} Early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.{{efn|"For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form"{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}}}} The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}), which was mathematically calculated.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=62}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}} [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that "all things are numbers".{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}}

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–65}} Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]) behind aesthetic perfection.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor [[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}{{efn|"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290–294.}} In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. [[Rhys Carpenter]] states that the ratio 2:1 was "the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]],{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=154}} a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=154–156}} The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=157–158}} and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=158}} The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=158–159}} It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=159}} The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=159–161}} with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} The apse depicts a scene of the poetess [[Sappho]] leaping off the [[Lefkada|Leucadian cliffs]], clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=162–164}}

The emperor [[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}} The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical [[dome]], and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=167–168}} The single [[oculus]] at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=168}} The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=169–170}} The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}}

===In early Christianity===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–65}} [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340 AD), bishop of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], praises Pythagoras in his ''Against Hierokles'' for his rule of silence, his frugality, his "extraordinary" morality, and his wise teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to [[Moses]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In one of his letter, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] ({{circa}} 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–58}} [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=58–59}} In ''[[On the Trinity]]'', Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a ''philosophos'' or "lover of wisdom" rather than a "sage".{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}} In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}}

==After antiquity==
===In the Middle Ages===
[[File:Pythagore-chartres.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval carving of a man with long hair and a long beard hunched over a musical instrument he is working on|Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the [[archivolts]] over the right door of the west portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes Laërtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from Greek into Latin{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's ''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as well,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work ''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in [[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}}

===On modern science===
In his preface to his book ''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161–171}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, "warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}

[[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} he attributed the discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} [[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be "a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that "In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36–37}} By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are "following the pure Pythagorean tradition."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}

===On vegetarianism===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Painting showing Pythagoras on the far left quizzically stroking his beard as he gazes upon a massive pile of fruits and vegetables. Two followers stand behind him, fully clothed. A man with a greying beard sits at the base of a tree gesturing to the pile of produce. Next to him, a fleshy, nude woman with blonde hair plucks fruits from it. Slightly behind her, two other women, one partially clothed and the other nude but obscured by the tree branch, are also plucking fruits. At the far right end of the painting, two nude, faun-like men with beards and pointed ears hurl more fruits upon the pile.|''Pythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism'' (1618-1630) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a belief that vegetarianism was healthful and nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]

A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} It was through [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise "Of Cruelty" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable "Pythagoras and the Countryman" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as "Pythagoreans".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled "To the Pythagorean Diet"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}

===On Western esotericism===
Early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish [[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the [[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a "religious magi"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} [[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean symbolism,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637),{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284–288}} and, in his book ''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287–288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286–287}} [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the "heirs of Pythagoras".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}

===On literature===
[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Engraving showing two small silhouettes standing before a tunnel of innumerably manifold circling angels leading to a bright, beautiful light at the end.|[[Dante Alighieri]]'s description of Heaven in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' incorporates Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}}]]

[[Dante Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56–57, he declares: "five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity."{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90–91}} The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction {{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of [[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of [[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91–92}} and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}

The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's ''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}

==Namesake==
Robert Grant or R.G. Smith contributed immeasurably to the preservation of the heritage and history of U.S. naval aviation through his 50-plus year career as an aeronautical engineer and as an accomplished artist.  The R.G. Smith Award for “excellence in naval aviation art” is bestowed by the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] in his honor.

R.G. Smith graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic College of Engineering in Oakland in 1934.  He was hired in 1936 as an engineer by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] Aircraft, then a subsidiary of [[Douglas Aircraft]], where he helped design naval aircraft such as the [[SBD Dauntless]], [[AD Skyraider]], [[F4D Skyray]], [[A-3 Skywarrior]], and the [[A-4 Skyhawk]].  

Later, he became the Douglas Company's full-time artist, spent time as a combat artist in [[Vietnam]], and was one of the five original founders of the American Society of Aviation Artists.  More than a million of his lithographs of commercial and military aircraft have been printed.

R.G. Smith died at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] on May 29, 2001 at the age of 87.

A selection of over 120 of his paintings and drawings, as well as a complete biography can be found in "R.G. Smith - The Man and his Art: An Autobiography".  Hardcover: 112 pages, Schiffer Publishing (February 1999), {{ISBN|0-7643-0755-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7643-0755-3}}.

R.G. Smith was designated Honorary [[Naval aviator|Naval Aviator]] Number 11 on May 8, 1973 by VADM William D. Houser, Deputey [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Air Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP18.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robin Kinross''' (born 1949&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=194&amp;fid=884 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404191109/http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=194&amp;fid=884 |archivedate=2012-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an author and publisher on the topic of visual communication and typography. His most significant work is ''Modern Typography.'' He is a proprietor of [[Hyphen Press]], which publishes books on design and typography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/authors/robin_kinross Robin Kinross | Authors | Hyphen Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinross did undergraduate and graduate studies at the Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the [[University of Reading]]. He moved to London in 1982. In the 1980s he contributed content to publications such as ''[[Blueprint (architecture magazine)|Blueprint]]'', ''[[Baseline (magazine)|Baseline]]'' and ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]''.

Kinross started Hyphen Press in 1980. ''Modern Typography'' was published in 1992. Since the 1990s, Hyphen produces about "two to four publications a year".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Important publications by Hyphen include Christopher Burke's ''[[Paul Renner]]'' and Fred Smeijers' ''Counterpunch''.

==''Modern Typography''==
''Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History'' is a critical history of printing and typography. Kinross asserts that modernism in typography emerged with the self-awareness of printing and the development of the rationality of its processes and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, Robin, Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History, Hyphen Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinross dates these emerging attitudes to around 1700 and then traces the evolution of modernist typography. According to [[Matthew Carter]], "Most histories of typography, particularly British ones, have been histories of traditional typography that treat Modernism as an aberration. Studies of Modernism, for their part, have tended to isolate it from contemporary traditional typography. This book aims to break down that separation by considering issues other than visual appearance, and by avoiding the ‘bibliophilic nostalgia’ so prevalent in typographic culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/review.php?id=36&amp;rid=309&amp;set=370 Eye Magazine | Review | Reflections of a typographer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book takes some inspiration in title and treatment from [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/journal/2000/08/21/kinross_interview An interview with Robin Kinross | Journal | Hyphen Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandinavian design''' is a [[design]] movement characterized by simplicity, [[minimalism]] and functionality that emerged in the early 20th century, and which flourished in the 1950s, in the five [[Nordic countries]] of [[Danish design|Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's The Deal With Scandinavian Furniture?|url=https://emfurn.com/blogs/elite-modern-furniture-blog/whats-the-deal-with-scandinavian-furniture|website=EMFURN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoVision tv and BeoLab14 speakers (14865163179).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] TV and speakers]]

In 1914, the Danish ''Selskabet for Dekorativ Kunst'' (Company for Decorative Arts) launched its ''{{ill |Skønvirke |da}}'' (literally "Graceful Work") magazine. Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Jugendstil]].&lt;ref name=Rekkali&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rekkali |first1=Zeynep |title=Danish Design: The birth, rise, fall and resurrection |url=https://danish.tm/article/danish-design-birth-rise-fall-resurrection/ |publisher=Danish |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] (furniture, textiles),&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian design |url=https://www.scandinavia-design.fr/design-scandinave_en.html |publisher=Scandinavia design |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arne Jacobsen]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Borge Mogensen]] (furniture),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Hans J. Wegner]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Verner Panton]] (plastic chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Poul Henningsen]] (lamps),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; and [[Maija Isola]] (printed textiles)&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; helped to create a "golden age of Scandinavian design".&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;!--please do not add anything here without citing a reliable source, it will be removed: and this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of every early designer, either, but a brief overview, so the list is long enough already--&gt;

The [[Lunning Prize]], awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krondahl |first1=Hans |title=Tema Lunning Prize winners |url=http://runeberg.org/tema/lunning.html |publisher=Runeberg |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.&lt;ref name=Rekkali/&gt;{{sfn|Englund|Schmidt|Wood|2007}}{{sfn|Halén|Wickman|2003}} Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingdal |first1=Cecilie |title=Let there be light |url=https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/stories/cecilie-ingdal |publisher=[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new old principles of HMD's #Nokia design |url=http://nokiamob.net/2017/08/15/the-new-old-principles-of-hmds-nokia-design/ |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=3 January 2018 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Gavin |title=Designed to Delight |url=https://www.volvocars.com/intl/cars/new-models/xc60/stories/scandinavian-design |publisher=[[Volvo]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leary, Erin |title='The Total Absence of Foreign Subjects': The Racial Politics of US Interwar Exhibitions of Scandinavian Design |journal=Design and Culture |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=283–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Design is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production, such as [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s 1958 [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Chair|url=http://www.aram.co.uk/egg-chair.html|publisher=Aram|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul Henningsen]]'s 1926 [[PH-lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  title=The PH lamp |  publisher=Visit Denmark |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  archivedate=2012-02-15 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | title=Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Denmark| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Iceland===

Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design and Architecture {{!}} General information |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDICDESIGN/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also founded in 1998, soon followed by  its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively Icelandic character in the nation's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland Design Centre |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Sweden===
{{see|Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design}}

Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and [[Sami people|Sami]] handicrafts. Swedish design was pioneered by [[Anders Beckman]] (graphics), [[Bruno Mathsson]] (furniture), [[Märta Måås-Fjetterström]] and [[Astrid Sampe]] (textile), and [[Sixten Sason]] (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are [[Svensk Form]], the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the [[Swedish Industrial Design Foundation]], known as SVID; the [[Swedish Arts Council]]; and the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design]] (known as ArkDes) on the island of [[Skeppsholmen]] in Stockholm, beside the [[Moderna Museet|modern art museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stylish functionality |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/swedish-design/|publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

In its original sense, a '''shaggy dog story''' or '''yarn''' is an extremely long-winded [[anecdote]] characterized by extensive narration of typically [[Non sequitur (literary device)|irrelevant incidents]] and terminated by an [[Anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] or a pointless punchline.

Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling. The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|title=Jokes|page=8|author=Ted Cohen|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-11230-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to be funny : an extremely silly guidebook|year=1978|author=Jovial Bob Stine|publisher= Dutton |isbn=0-525-32410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of their delivery is reflected in the [[English language|English]] [[idiom]] ''[[wiktionary:spin a yarn|spin a yarn]]'', by way of [[analogy]] with the production of [[yarn]].

==Archetypal story==

The commonly believed [[archetype]] of the shaggy dog story is a story that concerns a [[wikt:shaggy|shaggy]] dog.  The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, "That dog's not so shaggy." The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

{{quote|A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess.  When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions.  The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."}}

However, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named.  [[Eric Partridge]], for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in ''The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.

According to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the ''Times'' announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, "But not so shaggy as ''that'', sir!" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, "I don't think he's so shaggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secret of Humor|author=Leonard Feinberg|year=1978|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-6203-370-9|pages=181&amp;ndash;182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaggy Dog Story|work=World Wide Words|author=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha1.htm|date=19 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
===Mark Twain and the story of grandfather's old ram===
A typical shaggy dog story occurs in [[Mark Twain]]'s book about his travels west, ''[[Roughing It]]''. Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell "the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_story.html |title=The Story of Grandfather's Old Ram |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=26 September 2013 |author=Twain, Mark |author-link=Samuel Clemons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram ("There never was a bullier old ram than what he was"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.

Along the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose "widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in&amp;nbsp;..." As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends "suffocating with suppressed laughter." They now inform him that "at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it."

===Isaac Asimov and the story of the Shah Guido G. ===
In the collection of stories by [[Isaac Asimov]] titled ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]'', is a story titled "[[Shah Guido G.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asimov, Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |title=Buy Jupiter and other stories'', |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York, NY |year=1975 |pages=33–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on "shaggy dog".

==Examples in music==
* [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s classic anti-war story-song "[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]" is a shaggy dog story about the military draft, hippies, and improper disposal of garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Berman |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/booth-reviews/2010/11/song-of-the-day-alices-restaurant-massacree-by-arlo-guthrie/ |title=Song Of The Day – "Alice’s Restaurant Massacree" by Arlo Guthrie &amp;#124; Booth Reviews |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bromberg]]'s version of "Bullfrog Blues" (on "[[How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?]]") is a rambling shaggy dog story performed as a [[talking blues]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Foss |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-latell-ya-play-til-vol-1-live-mw0000200090 |title=How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?, Vol. 1: Live - David Bromberg &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=stevenhartwriter |url=https://stevenhartsite.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/blue-monday-26/ |title=Blue Monday &amp;#124; STEVENHARTSITE |publisher=Stevenhartsite.wordpress.com |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]," the final track on his 1999 album ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'', is an over-eleven-minute digression from one of the first topics mentioned in the song, the narrator-protagonist's longstanding dislike of [[sauerkraut]].

==Synopsis==
Cheered up by the revolutionary zeal, the courage and the energy of their leader Nikolai Alexandrovitch Shchors, in 1919 the peasants and workers groups gather in the devastated by the civil war [[Ukraine]], to defeat the foreign conquerors and enemies of the revolution. Shchors and his troops advance to [[Kiev]], the seat of the bourgeois nationalists under their leader [[Symon Petliura]], and take over the city. Other villages and towns fall. A bitter struggle with major losses blazes about [[Berdychiv]]. But Shchors' revolutionary forces remain victorious.

However, it does not take long until a new danger threatens: this time the [[Pan-Slavism|Polish Pans]] enter Ukraine, and General Dragomirov marches to Kiev. Shchors, however, gathers the revolutionary forces of the country and brings them to a victorious counter-attack.

'''''Shrovetide Revellers''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in 1615 and now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]. The painting shows people enjoying festivities at [[Shrovetide]] (Dutch: ''Carnaval'').

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] shows the face of an elegantly dressed smiling woman raising her right finger to make a point, while a man with a string of wurst around his neck grabs her shoulder to whisper in her ear. Another amused gentlemen leans on his shoulder and listens to their banter. Some claim these are the Baroque theatre characters ''Hans Wurst'' and ''[[Peeckelhaeringh]]''. Behind them other people are talking and laughing.

==Provenance==
The painting was first documented by [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1883, and after that was included in most catalogs of Hals' works, including by [[Ernst Wilhelm Moes]] in 1909, [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923, and by [[Gerrit David Gratama]] in 1946. The MET lists an Amsterdam sale entry from 1765 mentioning a genre work of ''Vasten-Avond'', or Shrovetide, and Slive mentions a period drawing by Mathys van den Bergh.

The female wears much more brightly colored clothing than any of Hals other sitters, and shows a strong resemblance to the young woman portrayed in Hals' [[Yonker Ramp and His Sweetheart]]. Both are considered to be genre works today, so the models could be anyone in Hals circle such as his children or pupils. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive included a full color photo of this work to demonstrate Hals' "love of life". The painting itself could not be included in the exhibition because it can never be lent out.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:Frans Hals Exhibition catalog, 1989|''Frans Hals'']], by [[Seymour Slive]] as editor, with contributions by [[Pieter Biesboer]], Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S. Jowell, Koos Levy-van Halm and Liesbeth Abraham, Bianca M. Du Mortier, Irene van Thiel-Stroman, page 129, Prestel-Verlag, Munich &amp; Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, 1989, {{ISBN|3791310321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year that Slive was writing his exhibition catalog, [[Claus Grimm]] rejected the attribution of this painting to Frans Hals, though he conceded it was probably after a painting by Hals, calling it a copy of a lost original.&lt;ref&gt;''Entry "k1" in [[:Commons:Frans Hals catalog raisonné, 1989|Frans Hals : het gehele oeuvre]]'', by Claus Grimm, Amsterdam, Meulenhoff/Landshoff, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Hals' positioning of the figures are related to two other known paintings:

== ''Spill: Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity'' ==
''Spill'' is a 2017 book of prose and poetry by Alexis Pauline Gumbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/spill|title=Spill|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a labor of love, and an experimental and poetic work of literary criticism based on the work of [[Hortense Spillers]] and the literary archive of freedom seeking black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexispauline.com/brillianceremastered/bio/|title=Bio|last=Gumbs|first=Alexis Pauline|date=22 Mar 2018|website=alexispauline.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Containing the first syllable of Spillers’ last name, it is an ode to Hortense, the individual, as much as it nurtures–and is nurtured by–black femme folk across vast spatiotemporal locations. The subtitle, "''Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity"'' nods to [[Saidiya Hartman]]’s Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-making in Nineteenth Century America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scenes-of-subjection-9780195089844?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America|date=1997-09-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195089844|series=Race and American Culture|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work pays homage to not just Saidiya, and not just Hortense, in fact not any singular “I” understood within a Cartesian ''"[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" which would subordinate the collective to the individual. “When I turned these phrases, doors opened and everyone came through,” Gumbs writes of her engagement with Spillers’ work, “all the black women writers Spillers wrote about and didn’t write about. All the characters those black women writers acknowledged and ignored.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gumbs converses with black study and black womanhood: past, present, and future.

== Interventions ==
By introducing the concept of writing "with" black women as opposed to writing "about" or "to" an audience, ''Spill'' is testament to the fact that an academic book can be written whilst citing one black woman directly in the text. This is a key intervention, performance, and achievement. Every in-text citation references Spillers’s ''Black, White, and in Color: Essays on American Literature and Culture.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3624045.html|title=Black, White, and in Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Spill’''s endnotes, Gumbs lists a bibliography of “Indirect References and Suggested Reading,” composed entirely of women of color authors––most of whom are black. If nothing else, the following message is clear: read and cite black women. By engaging Spillers through poetry, an omnitemporal, omnipresent black womanhood emerges on the page. 

== Reception ==
Hortense Spillers stated in public conversation: "Nobody else is like Alexis. ...There is really nothing else like this book in my experience as a student, a scholar, a reader, a teacher. The kind of conversation that the text is setting up between poetry and prose, and between a poetic posture and a scholarly posture, I don't think I've ever seen that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=John Hope Franklin Center at Duke University|title=Left of Black with Hortense Spillers and Alexis Pauline Gumbs|date=2017-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-EZQ1BTfE&amp;t=1989s|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Review of books calls it "''a 'poetilitical praxis,' an unflinching look at what pain has wrought and what fruit might yet be born.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/we-stay-in-love-with-our-freedom-a-conversation-with-alexis-pauline-gumbs/#!|title=We Stay in Love with Our Freedom: A Conversation with Alexis Pauline Gumbs - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spill'' was nominee in the '''29th [[Lambda Literary Awards]],''' held on June 12, 2017 in the category of LGBTQ Non-Fiction.

[[File:UmbrellaSwift.jpg|thumb|A wooden umbrella swift]]
[[File:Simm Stickerin.jpg|thumb|An umbrella swift in the background, holding a skein of red yarn]]
A '''swift''' is a tool used to hold a [[hank (textile)|hank]] of [[yarn]] while it is being wound off.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"Swift." ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It has an adjustable diameter so that it can hold hanks of many sizes, and rotates around a central rod.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interweave"&gt;Handwoven Magazine. "Weaving Terms." ''Weaving Resources.'' Interweave Press. March 1, 2008 &lt;http://www.interweave.com/weave/projects_articles/Weaving-terms.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally made out of wood or metal, however other materials may also be used. In the 18th and 19th centuries, swifts were sometimes made of [[whale]] [[ivory]] and they are now sought-after antiques. Swifts are not used very much in the textile industry, but are used more by [[knitting|knitters]] and [[crochet]]ers who buy their yarn in hank form. The swift allows for easy balling, without the yarn getting tangled and knotted.

==Types==
A swift can be as simple as four rods fixed into an axis, with bands connecting them. By sliding the bands the effective diameter changes, for different sized hanks.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; However, most swifts are more complicated than this. 

The 'umbrella swift' is one of the more common varieties, the advantage of it being that it folds up when not in use. Wooden umbrella swifts are the most common type of swift in use. They are preferred by [[spinning (textiles)|hand spinners]] because they fold up, which is good for storage,  and they are generally more stable, of higher quality, and look nicer than metal umbrella swifts. 

Another type is the 'Amish style' swift, a rotating cross with positionable pegs to adjust for different diameters of hanks. 

[[File:Spinner's Weasel.JPG|thumb|A spinner's weasel to the left]]
A [[spinners weasel]] is similar to a swift, however it does not adjust to various sized hanks. While today this is a big disadvantage, as different manufacturers don't always make hanks the same size, it was not an issue when all yarn was hand spun. At this time hanks from one spinner would all be the same size, as they would have been made on the same [[niddy noddy]], thus only one diameter was needed.

===Common substitutes===
In the modern day spinners' weasels are even less common than swifts. 

One substitute for a swift is to have someone else hold the hank.&lt;ref&gt;Breiter, Barbara; Diven, Gail. [https://books.google.com/books?id=blkqpMqIzBYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=umbrella+swift&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=Ui6AIoFyI33FCil1QHcUqBrdDAQ ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Knitting and Crocheting Illustrated''.] 2nd ed. Alpha Books, 2003. {{ISBN|1-59257-089-5}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on May 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has had a lot of practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.

Another common substitute is the back of a chair. The disadvantages of this is that the hank is not kept under tension, and thus the yarn has a tendency to get tangled, and one has to stop very often to untangle it.

==Uses==
Swifts are most commonly used to ball a [[hank (textile)|hank]] of [[yarn]]. An increasing percentage of yarn is sold in hank form, especially hand dyed or hand spun yarns, which necessitates balling for  [[knitting|knitters]] and [[crochet]]ers. Swifts are also sometimes used by [[weaving|weavers]] in preparing the [[warp (weaving)|warp]]: if the yarn for the warp comes in a hank, the warp can be wound directly onto the warping board from the swift.&lt;ref name="Interweave"/&gt; As weaving yarns generally come on cones though, this use isn't as prevalent.

'''''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''''' is an essay written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] which first appeared in The New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine in 1843. It was later reprinted in the “Medical Essays” in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.htm|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is included as Volume 38, Part 5 of the [[Harvard Classics]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Classics, Vol. 38, Part 5   The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Synopsis==

In just under 12,000 words Holmes argues forcefully and convincingly that the rampant infection killing women within a few days of childbirth was caused mainly through infection spread by their birth attendants. He also laid down well-thought out and easy to execute behaviors through which the spread of infection could be contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==

Holmes developed an interest in [[puerperal fever]] by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1838 to 1840.  In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination of a woman who had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
“The disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|date=1843|publisher=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery 1|page=213|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery in April 1843.  Due to low circulation of this specialized journal and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary of Practical Medicine. Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that "Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=James|title=A Dictionary of Practical Medicine|date=1852|publisher=New York: Harper and Brothers|location=volume 7|page=559|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnellé, Dugé, Dewees and others still denying this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Twelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it “Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.” He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence|date=1855|publisher=Boston: Ticknor and Fields|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crucifixion of St Julia''''' is a [[triptych]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. Like many  Bosch paintings, the date of this work was long disputed, until [[dendochronology|dendochronologic]] analysis assigned it to around 1497.&lt;ref name ="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch|publisher=Skira|location=Milan|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed at the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] in [[Venice]].  

==History==
According to some historians, Bosch could have painted this work during a short trip to northern Italy, although it is more likely that it was a commission from an Italian trader or diplomat active in the [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name ="Varallo"/&gt;

The earliest mention of the triptych comes from the 1771 treatise ''Della pittura veneziana'', as located in the Palazzo Ducale's "Sala dell'Eccelso Tribunale". In 1893 it was moved by the Austrians to Vienna, where it remained until 1919 when it was returned to Venice. The work has been damaged by a fire, although its attribution to Bosch has never been disputed.&lt;ref name ="Varallo"/&gt;

==Description==
The central panel depicts the [[crucifixion]] of a saint usually identified with [[Saint Julia of Corsica]] (sometimes with [[Saint Wilgefortis]]). In a depiction related to Christ's crucifixion, the centrally themed woman is in an elevated position against the sky, balanced by a large crowd gathered at the foot of the cross, including executioners and common people. A typical element is the fainting man supported by his neighbors. 

The sides show two cities: at right, a port characterized by fanciful domed buildings and several sunken ships; at left is city on fire, occupied by demons. At the bottom are several parapets, with, at left, a hermit with a dark hood (perhaps ''St. Anthony in Meditation''), and, at right, a monk and a soldier who point at the central panel, traditionally identified as slave-dealers.

'''''The Real''''' is an American [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]]. The series initially received a trial run on [[Fox Television Stations|Fox owned]] markets in the summer of 2013. The series was developed as a talk show designed to appeal to younger female viewers who, like the co-hosts, were experiencing new events in their lives. It was green-lit for national syndication later that fall and officially premiered the following year.

On January 3, 2018, [[Fox Television Stations]] picked up two more seasons of the series, effectively allowing [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]] to continue to produce it into the 2019-20 television season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘The Real’ Renewed By Fox TV Stations Through 2020|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-real-renewed-fox-tv-stations-through-2020-1202234929/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Warren–Brooks Award''' for literary criticism was established to honor the innovative, critical interpretation of literature offered by [[Robert Penn Warren]] and [[Cleanth Brooks]] to celebrate the continuation of such achievement. It is awarded for outstanding literary criticism originally published in English in the United States of America and is given in those years when a book, or other worthy publication, appears that exemplifies the Warren–Brooks effort in spirit, scope, and integrity.

The award is given annually by the advisory group of the Center for Robert Penn Warren Studies at [[Western Kentucky University]] for outstanding literary criticism originally published in English in the United States.

'''Welfare State International''' was a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] [[experimental theatre]] group formed in 1968 by John Fox&lt;ref name=dggjf/&gt; and Sue Gill&lt;ref name=dggsg/&gt;, Roger Coleman&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=Jeff|title=Performance Art Memoirs|volume=1|year=1979|publisher=John Calder|isbn=0714537888|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "A collective of radical artists and thinkers who explored ideas of celebratory art and spectacle between 1968 and 2006."&lt;ref name=WSIArch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/aboutwsi.htm|title=Welfare State International - About WSI|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The company's name was originally 'The Welfare State', based on the concept of offering art for all on the same basis as education and health.&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1970sproject.co.uk/events/papers/gillian-whiteley.pdf|title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies  |work=1970sproject.co.uk|first=Gillian |last=Whiteley }}{{Deadlink | date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/12293/3/Whiteley-Final%20accepted%20paper.pdf |title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies |first=Gillian |last=Whiteley |work=dspace.lboro.ac.uk |accessdate = 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International was initially known for staging large-scale outdoor spectacular events. At this time (the late 1960s), forsaking theatres and galleries for the street was unusual.

In November 2001, Welfare State International was described by the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] Guide as "Britain's foremost arts and installations collective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/john.htm|title=Welfare State International - John Fox|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare State International's 'The Raising of the Titanic' (Limehouse Basin, London, 1983) has been listed among "Productions that transformed theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/01/experimental-theatre-spill-festival|title=Guardian article (2009/apr/01) ''Experimental theatre to spill into the mainstream'' |work=theguardian.com |accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International ceased operating on April Fools' Day 2006 after a performance at [[Ulverston]].&lt;ref name=dggjf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2250|title=Dead Good Guides page for John Fox |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dggsg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2254 |title=Dead Good Guides page for Sue Gill |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willard Van Orman Quine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|aɪ|n}}; known to intimates as "Van";&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Quine|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]]  and [[logician]] in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], recognized as "one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/arts/29QUIN.html "W. V. Quine, Philosopher Who Analyzed Language and Reality, Dies at 92"]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with [[Harvard University]] in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and [[set theory]], and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html "So who *is* the most important philosopher of the past 200 years?"] Leiter Reports.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Kva.se. Retrieved August 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] for his "outstanding contributions to the progress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based on keen insights in logic, [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]] and philosophy of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willard Van Orman Quine|url=http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k12_c_willard/ctn_e.html|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=December 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720223632/http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k12_c_willard/ctn_e.html|archivedate=July 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not [[conceptual analysis]] but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences.  His major writings include "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" (1951), which attacked the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] [[proposition]]s and advocated a form of [[semantic holism]], and ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous [[indeterminacy of translation]] thesis, advocating a [[behaviorist]] [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. He also developed an influential [[naturalized epistemology]] that tried to provide "an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input."&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/quine-sc/ "Quine's Philosophy of Science"]. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Iep.utm.edu. July 27, 2009. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also important in [[philosophy of science]] for his "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself"&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that "philosophy of science is philosophy enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251091?cookieSet=1 "Mr Strawson on Logical Theory"]. WV Quine. ''Mind'' Vol. 62 No. 248. Oct. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy of mathematics]], he and his Harvard colleague [[Hilary Putnam]] developed the "[[Philosophy of mathematics#Indispensability argument for realism|Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]]," an argument for the [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|reality of mathematical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan, Mark, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/mathphil-indis/ "Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to his autobiography, ''The Time of My Life'' (1986), Quine grew up in [[Akron, Ohio]], where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds)&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; He received his B.A. in mathematics from [[Oberlin College]] in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] in 1932. His thesis supervisor was [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. He was then appointed a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]], which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]) and members of the [[Vienna Circle]] (including [[Rudolf Carnap]]), as well as the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

It was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 [[Unity of Science]] Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] before the [[Third Reich]] invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.

During World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a [[military intelligence]] role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

At Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard [[graduate theses]] of, among others, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Gilbert Harman]], [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], [[Hugues LeBlanc]],  [[Henry Hiz]] and [[George Myro]]. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html "Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958–1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=March 14, 2017 }}. Weselyan University. Wesleyan.edu. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980
Quine received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Quine was an atheist when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of W.V. Quine|year=1986|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812690101|page=6|last1=Quine |first1=Willard Van Orman |last2=Hahn |first2=Lewis Edwin |quote=In my third year of high school I walked often with my new Jamaican friends, Fred and Harold Cassidy, trying to convert them from their Episcopalian faith to atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had four children by two marriages.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; Guitarist [[Robert Quine]] was his nephew.

In the foreword to the new edition of ''Word and Object'', Quine's student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to ''Word and Object.'' Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, "I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer." He passed away from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; W.V. Quine. ''Word and Object'' 2013. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political beliefs===
Quine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [http://www.wvquine.org/wvq-obit3.html obituary] for W V Quine – January 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in ''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', he wrote a defense of [[moral censorship]];&lt;ref&gt;''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', entry for Tolerance (pp. 206–8)&lt;/ref&gt; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Paradoxes of Plenty" in ''Theories and Things'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'', pp. 352–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Quine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on [[formal logic]] and [[set theory]]. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his "naturalized epistemology" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a "first philosophy", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his [[philosophical naturalism|naturalism]].

Quine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English.

Like the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on Hume.{{Clarify|reason=These words mean nothing to non-experts: 'logical positivist', 'philosophical canon', and 'Hume.'  What is this sentence trying to tell me?|date=October 2014}}

===Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction===
{{See also|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity|l1=Two Dogmas of Empiricism}}
In the 1930s and 40s, discussions with [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Nelson Goodman]] and [[Alfred Tarski]], among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between "analytic" statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as "All bachelors are unmarried"—and "synthetic" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as "There is a cat on the mat." This distinction was central to [[logical positivism]]. Although Quine is not normally associated with [[verificationism]], some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague [[B. F. Skinner]] and his analysis of language in ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prawitz, Dag. 'Quine and Verificationism.' In ''Inquiry'', Stockholm, 1994, pp 487–494&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers before him, Quine accepted the [[definition]] of "analytic" as "true in virtue of meaning alone". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was [[circular definition|circular]]. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. 

Quine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of [[synonymy]] (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one "black" in a proposition like "All black things are black" (or any other [[logical truth]]). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between "All unmarried men are bachelors" and "There have been black dogs", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to ''collateral information'' bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.

Another approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of [[logical possibility]]. A traditional [[Wittgenstein]]ian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.

===Confirmation holism and ontological relativity===
The central theses underlying the [[indeterminacy of translation]] and other extensions of Quine's work are [[ontological relativity]] and the related [[doctrine]] of [[confirmation holism]]. The premise of confirmation [[holism]] is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.

Quine concluded his "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of [[Homer]] . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's ontological [[relativism]] (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with [[Pierre Duhem]] that for any collection of [[empirical evidence]], there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's [[holism]] is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to [[physics]] or possibly to [[natural science]], while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or [[falsifiability|falsify]] whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a [[Coherentism|coherent]] web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.

===Existence and its contrary===
The [[Problem of empty names|problem of non-referring names]] is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?'  It can be answered, moreover, in a word—'Everything'—and everyone will accept this answer as true.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "[[On What There Is]]", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More directly, the controversy goes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we talk about [[Pegasus]]?  To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer?  If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this?  Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth!  If we speak the truth, this must be truth ''about something''.  So we cannot be speaking of nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above.  Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them.  However, [[Czesław Lejewski]] criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.  Lejewski writes further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory.  The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lejewski then goes on to offer a description of [[free logic]], which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.

Lejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,Fx \rightarrow \exists x\,Fx&lt;/math&gt;.  Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Lejewski, "Logic and Existence". ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 5 (1954–55), pp. 104–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic===
Over the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his ''Selected Logic Papers'' and in ''The Ways of Paradox''.

Quine confined logic to classical bivalent [[first-order logic]], hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) [[universe of discourse]]. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:
* Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to [[higher-order logic]] as "set theory in disguise";
* Much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' included in logic was not logic for Quine.
* Formal systems involving [[intension]]al notions, especially [[modal logic|modality]]. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], a battle he largely lost when [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|relational semantics]] became canonical for [[modal logic]]s.

Quine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:
* ''Elementary Logic''. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to [[quantification theory]] or [[first-order predicate logic]]. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to his teaching needs.
* ''Methods of Logic''. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.
* ''Philosophy of Logic''. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of [[modal logic|quantified modal logic]], and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.

''Mathematical Logic'' is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]], along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s later lucid exposition of these and related results.

Quine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include [[analytic tableau]]x, [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s, and [[model theory]]. His treatment of [[metalogic]] left something to be desired. For example, ''Mathematical Logic'' does not include any proofs of [[soundness]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]]. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his ''Methods of Logic'') for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.

Most of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his [[predicate functor logic]], one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]]s. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his ''Methods of Logic''.

Quine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] employed in [[electrical engineering]], and with [[Edward J. McCluskey]], devised the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]] of reducing [[Boolean equation]]s to a minimum covering sum of [[prime implicant]]s.

===Set theory===
While his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in [[set theory]] that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[nominalism]] for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.

Over the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the [[axiom of extensionality]]:
* [[New Foundations]], NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that [[type theory]] would allow, were the [[ontology]] to include types. However, Quine's set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many "large" sets the now-canonical [[ZFC]] set theory does not allow, even sets for which the [[axiom of choice]] does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with [[Zermelo set theory]] without Choice. A modification of NF, [[New Foundations|NFU]], due to R. B. Jensen and admitting [[urelement]]s (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]], thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);
* The set theory of ''Mathematical Logic'' is NF augmented by the [[proper class]]es of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], except axiomatized in a much simpler way;
* The set theory of ''Set Theory and Its Logic'' does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960. 

All three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any [[hierarchy]] of [[Type (metaphysics)|types]], they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.

Quine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the [[Sheffer stroke]], and one quantifier, the [[universal quantifier]]. All polyadic [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to [[modus ponens]] and substitution. He preferred [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] to either [[disjunction]] or the [[Material conditional|conditional]], because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: [[set abstraction|abstraction]] and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]]. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic," ch. 5 in his ''From a Logical Point of View''.

===Epistemology===
Just as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional [[normative]] [[epistemology]].  According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by [[Rudolf Carnap]]) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/#2|title=Naturalized Epistemology|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology." (Quine, 1969: 82–3)

Quine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with [[Jaegwon Kim]] the most prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ "Naturalized Epistemology"].

==In popular culture==
* A [[computer program]] whose output is its own source code is called a "[[Quine (computing)|quine]]" after Quine. This usage was introduced by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his 1979 book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''.
* Quine is a recurring character in the webcomic "[[Existential Comics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/36]. Existential Comics. Accessed November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* Quine was selected for inclusion in the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]'s "Pantheon of Skeptics," which celebrates contributors to the cause of [[scientific skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=April 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=January 31, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Xanthelasma''''' is a sharply demarcated yellowish deposit of cholesterol underneath the skin, usually on or around the [[eyelids]].&lt;ref name="frew"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frew JW, Murrell DF, Haber RM | title = Fifty shades of yellow: a review of the xanthodermatoses | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 1109–23 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26227781 | doi = 10.1111/ijd.12945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are neither harmful to the skin nor [[Pain|painful]], these minor growths may be disfiguring and can be removed.&lt;ref name="frew"/&gt; There is no high-quality evidence that xanthelasma deposits are related to blood [[low-density lipoprotein]] levels or increased risk of [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozdöl S, Sahin S, Tokgözoğlu L | title = Xanthelasma palpebrarum and its relation to atherosclerotic risk factors and lipoprotein (a) | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 785–9 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18717856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03690.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''xanthelasma'' may be referred to as a ''[[xanthoma]]'' when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shields | first1 = Carol | last2 = Shields | first2 = Jerry | name-list-format = vanc | title=Eyelid, conjunctival and orbital tumors: atlas and textbook |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7578-7 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xanthelasma'' is often classified simply as a subtype of ''xanthoma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Xanthelasma | work = Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition=8th |year=2009 |access-date=November 8, 2012 |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/xanthelasma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==Treatment==
''Xanthelasmata'' can be removed with a [[trichloroacetic acid]] peel, surgery, [[laser]]s or [[cryotherapy]]. Removal may cause scarring and pigment changes, but it is an uncommon side-effect of treatment. 

== Prognosis ==
Recurrence is common: 40% of patients with XP had recurrence after primary surgical excision, 60% after secondary excision, and 80% when all four eyelids were involved. A possible cause might be insufficiently deep excisions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair PA, Singhal R | title = Xanthelasma palpebrarum - a brief review | journal = Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology | volume = 11 | pages = 1–5 | date = 2017-12-18 | pmid = 29296091 | pmc = 5739544 | doi = 10.2147/CCID.S130116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Xanthelasma is a rare disorder in the General population, with a variable incidence of 0.56%–1.5% in western developed countries. The age of onset ranges  ranges from 15 to 75 with a peak in the 4th to 5th decades of life. There also seems to be a greater prevalance in females, but this might be due to higher consciousness to cosmetic defects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain A, Goyal P, Nigam PK, Gurbaksh H, Sharma RC | title = Xanthelasma Palpebrarum-clinical and biochemical profile in a tertiary care hospital of Delhi | journal = Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–3 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 23105704 | pmc = 3453794 | doi = 10.1007/BF02913335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
The word is derived from Greek ''xanthós, [[wikt:ξανθός|ξανθός]] '', "yellow" and ''élasma, έλασμα'', "foil". The plural is ''xanthelasmata''.
