'''3D reconstruction from multiple images''' is the creation of [[three-dimensional model]]s from a set of images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes.

The essence of an image is a projection from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, during which process the depth is lost. The 3D point corresponding to a specific image point is constrained to be on the line of sight. From a single image, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to the image point. If two images are available, then the position of a 3D point can be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. This process is referred to as [[triangulation (computer vision)|triangulation]]. The key for this process is the relations between multiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of points must contain some structure and that this structure is related to the poses and the calibration of the camera.

In recent decades, there is an important demand for 3D content for [[computer graphics]], [[virtual reality]] and communication, triggering a change in emphasis for the requirements. Many existing systems for constructing 3D models are built around specialized hardware (e.g. stereo rigs) resulting in a high cost, which cannot satisfy the requirement of its new applications. This gap stimulates the use of digital imaging facilities (like a camera). Moore's law also tells us that more work can be done in software. An early method was proposed by Tomasi and Kanade.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;C. Tomasi and T. Kanade, “[http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3040&amp;context=compsci Shape and motion from image streams under orthography: A factorization approach]”, International Journal of Computer Vision, 9(2):137-154, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; They used an affine factorization approach to extract 3D from images sequences. However, the assumption of [[orthographic projection]] is a significant limitation of this system.

==Processing==

The task of converting multiple 2D images into 3D model consists of a series of processing steps:

[[Color mapping|Camera calibration]] consists of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, without which at some level no arrangement of algorithms can work. The dotted line between Calibration and Depth determination represents that the camera calibration is usually required for determining depth.

'''Depth determination''' serves as the most challenging part in the whole process, as it calculates the 3D component missing from any given image – depth. The correspondence problem, finding matches between two images so the position of the matched elements can then be triangulated in 3D space is the key issue here.

Once you have the multiple depth maps you have to combine them to create a final mesh by calculating depth and projecting out of the camera – '''registration'''. Camera calibration will be used to identify where the many meshes created by depth maps can be combined together to develop a larger one, providing more than one view for observation.

By the stage of '''Material Application''' you have a complete 3D mesh, which may be the final goal, but usually you will want to apply the color from the original photographs to the mesh. This can range from projecting the images onto the mesh randomly, through approaches of combining the textures for super resolution and finally to segmenting the mesh by material, such as specular and diffuse properties.

==Mathematical description of reconstruction==

Given a group of 3D points viewed by N cameras with matrices '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}_{i=1\ldots N}&lt;/math&gt;'''. Define '''&lt;math&gt;m_j^i\simeq P^iw_j&lt;/math&gt;''' be the homogeneous coordinates of the projection of the '''&lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt;''' point onto the '''&lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt;''' camera. The reconstruction problem can be changed to: given the group of pixel coordinates '''&lt;math&gt;\{m_j^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''', find the corresponding set of camera matrices '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and the scene structure '''&lt;math&gt;\{w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;
m_j^i\simeq P^iw_j
&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Generally, without further restrictions, we will obtain a projective reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mohr and E. Arbogast. 
It can be done without camera calibration. 
Pattern Recognition Letters, 12:39-43, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Faugeras. 
[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.4708&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf What can be seen in three dimensions with an uncalibrated stereo rig?] 
In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 563-578, Santa Margherita L., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; If '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\{w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;'''  satisfy (1), '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^iT\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\{T^{-1}w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;''' will satisfy (1) with any '''4 × 4''' nonsingular matrix '''T'''.

A projective reconstruction can be calculated by points correspondences only, without any a-priori information.

== Autocalibration ==
'''Autocalibration''' or self-calibration is the classical approach, in which camera motion and parameters are recovered first, using rigidity, then structure is readily calculated. Two methods implementing this idea are presented as follows:

=== Kruppa equations ===
With a minimum of three displacements, we can obtain the internal parameters of the camera using a system of polynomial equations due to Kruppa,&lt;ref&gt;E. Kruppa. Zur Ermittlung eines Objektes aus zwei Perspektiven mit innerer Orientierung. Sitz.-Ber.Akad.Wiss., Wien, math. naturw. Kl., Abt. IIa., 122:1939-1948, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; which are derived from a geometric interpretation of the rigidity constraint.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Maybank and O. Faugeras. A theory of self-calibration of a moving camera. International Journal of Computer Vision, 8(2):123-151, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Faugeras and S. Maybank. [https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/54/01/PDF/RR-1157.pdf Motion from point matches: multiplicity of solutions]. International Journal of Computer Vision, 4(3):225-246, June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrix '''&lt;math&gt;K = AA^{\top}&lt;/math&gt;''' is unknown in the Kruppa equations, named Kruppa coefficients matrix. With ''' K''' and by the method of Cholesky factorization one can obtain the intrinsic parameters easily:

:&lt;math&gt; K= 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_1 &amp; k_2 &amp; k_3 \\
k_2 &amp; k_4 &amp; k_5 \\
k_3 &amp; k_5 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recently Hartley &lt;ref name="Hartley"&gt;R. I. Hartley. [http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/hartley/public_html/Papers/kruppa/final-version/kruppa2.pdf Kruppa's equations derived from the fundamental matrix]. 
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19(2):133-135, February 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simpler form. Let '''&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;''' be written as '''&lt;math&gt;F = DUV^\top&lt;/math&gt;''', where

Then the Kruppa equations are rewritten (the derivation can be found in &lt;ref name="Hartley"/&gt;)

=== Mendonça and Cipolla ===
This method is based on the use of rigidity constraint. Design a cost function, which considers the intrinsic parameters as arguments and the [[Fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrices]] as parameters. '''&lt;math&gt;{F}_ij&lt;/math&gt;''' is defined as the fundamental matrix, '''&lt;math&gt;{A}_i&lt;/math&gt;'''and '''&lt;math&gt;{A}_j&lt;/math&gt;''' as intrinsic parameters matrices.

== Stratification ==
Recently, new methods based on the concept of '''stratification''' have been proposed. Starting from a projective structure, which can be calculated from correspondences only, upgrade this projective reconstruction to a Euclidean reconstruction, by making use of all the available constraints. With this idea the problem can be stratified into different sections: according to the amount of constraints available, it can be analyzed at a different level, projective, affine or Euclidean.

=== The stratification of 3D geometry ===
Usually, the world is perceived as a 3D [[Euclidean space]]. In some cases, it is not possible to use the full Euclidean structure of 3D space. The simplest being projective, then the affine geometry which forms the intermediate layers and finally Euclidean geometry. The concept of stratification is closely related to the series of transformations on geometric entities: in the projective stratum is a series of projective transformations (a [[homography (computer vision)|homography]]), in the affine stratum is a series of [[affine transformations]], and in Euclidean stratum is a series of Euclidean transformations.

Suppose that a fixed scene is captured by two or more perspective cameras and the correspondences between visible points in different images are already given. However, in practice, the matching is an essential and extremely challenging issue in computer vision. Here, we suppose that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 3D points &lt;math&gt;A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are observed by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; cameras with projection matrices &lt;math&gt;P_{j},j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt; Neither the positions of point nor the projection of camera are known. Only the projections &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; point in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; image are known.

===Projective reconstruction===
Simple counting indicates we have &lt;math&gt;2nm&lt;/math&gt; independent measurements and only &lt;math&gt;11 m + 3 n&lt;/math&gt; unknowns, so the problem is supposed to be soluble with enough points and images. The equations in homogeneous coordinates can be represented:

:&lt;math&gt;
a_{ij}\sim P_{j}A_{i}\qquad i=1,\ldots n,~~j=1,\ldots m
&lt;/math&gt;       (2)

So we can apply a nonsingular '''4 × 4''' transformation ''H'' to projections '''&lt;math&gt;P_{j}&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;P_{j}H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;''' and world points '''&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;HA_i&lt;/math&gt;'''. Hence, without further constraints, reconstruction is only an unknown projective deformation of the 3D world.

===Affine reconstruction===
''See [[affine space]] for more detailed information about computing the location of the plane at infinity '''&lt;math&gt;{\Pi}_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;'''.''
The simplest way is to exploit prior knowledge, for example the information that lines in the scene are parallel or that a point is the one thirds between two others.

We can also use prior constraints on the camera motion. By analyzing different images of the same point can obtain a line in the direction of motion. The intersection of several lines is the point at infinity in the motion direction, and one constraint on the affine structure.

===Euclidean reconstruction===
By mapping the projective reconstruction to one that satisfies a group of redundant Euclidean constraints, we can find a projective transformation ''H'' in equation (2).The equations are highly nonlinear and a good initial guess for the structure is required. This can be obtained by assuming a linear projection - parallel projection, which also allows easy reconstruction by SVD decomposition.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic vs geometric error ==
Inevitably, measured data (i.e., image or world point positions) is noisy and the noise comes from many sources. To reduce the effect of noise, we usually use more equations than necessary and solve with [[least squares]].

For example, in a typical null-space problem formulation Ax = 0 (like the DLT algorithm), the square of the residual ||Ax|| is being minimized with the least squares method.

In general, if ||Ax|| can be considered as a distance between the geometrical entities (points, lines, planes, etc.), then what is being minimized is a '''geometric error''', otherwise (when the error lacks a good geometrical interpretation) it is called an '''algebraic error'''.

Therefore, compared with algebraic error, we prefer to minimize a geometric error for the reasons listed:
# The quantity being minimized has a meaning.
# The solution is more stable.
# The solution is constant under Euclidean transforms.

All the linear algorithms (DLT and others) we have seen so far minimize an algebraic error. Actually, there is no justification in minimizing an algebraic error apart from the ease of implementation, as it results in a linear problem. The minimization of a geometric error is often a non-linear problem, that admit only iterative solutions and requires a starting point.

Usually, linear solution based on algebraic residuals serves as a starting point for a non-linear minimization of a geometric cost function, which provides the solution a final “polish”.&lt;ref&gt;R.

== 3D reconstruction of Medical Images ==

=== Motivation &amp; applications ===
The 2-D imaging has problems of anatomy overlapping with each other and don’t disclose the abnormalities. The 3-D imaging can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

3-D models are used for planning the operation, morphometric studies and has more reliability in orthopedics.
[[File:Epipolar Geometry1.svg|thumb|Projection of P on both cameras]]

=== Problem statement &amp; Basics ===
To reconstruct 3-D images from 2-D images taken by a camera at multiple angles. [[Medical imaging]] techniques like [[CT scanning]] and MRI are expensive, and although CT scans are accurate, they can induce high radiation doses which is a risk for patients with certain diseases. Methods based on MRI are not accurate. Since we are exposed to powerful magnetic fields during an MRI scan, this method is not suitable for patients with ferromagnetic metallic implants. Both the methods can be done only when in lying position where the global structure of the bone changes. So, we discuss the following methods which can be performed while standing and require low radiation dose.

Though these techniques are 3-D imaging, the region of interest is restricted to a slice; data is acquired to form a time sequence.  

==== 1) Stereo Corresponding Point Based Technique ====
This method is simple and implemented by identifying the points manually in multi-view radiographs. The first step is to extract the corresponding points in two x-ray images and second step is the 3D reconstruction with algorithms like Discrete Linear Transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Pearcy/publication/19301926_Stereo_radiography_of_lumbar_spine_motion/links/543b04fb0cf204cab1daf4ee.pdf|title=Pearcy MJ. 1985. Stereo radiography of lumbar spine motion. Acta Orthop Scand Suppl|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using DLT, the reconstruction is done only where there are SCPs. By increasing the number of points, the results improve &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Aubin CE, Dansereau J, Parent F, Labelle H, de Guise JA. 1997. Morphometric evaluations of personalised 3D reconstructions and geometric models of the human spine|url=|journal=Med Biol Eng Comput|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is time consuming. This method has low accuracy because of low reproducibility and time consumption. This method is dependent on the skill of the operator. This method is not suitable for bony structures with continuous shape. This method is generally used as an initial solution for other methods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W5/319/2015/isprsarchives-XL-1-W5-319-2015.pdf|title=S.Hosseinian, H.Arefi, 3D Reconstruction from multiview medical X-ray images- Review and evaluation of existing methods.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2) Non-Stereo corresponding contour method (NCSS) ====
This method uses X-ray images for 3D Reconstruction and to develop 3D models with low dose radiations in weight bearing positions.

In NSCC algorithm, the preliminary step is calculation of an initial solution. Firstly anatomical regions from the generic object are defined. Secondly, manual 2D contours identification on the radiographs is performed. From each radiograph 2D contours are generated using the 3D initial solution object. 3D contours of the initial object surface are projected onto their associated radiograph.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2D association performed between these 2 set points is based on point-to-point distances and contours derivations developing a correspondence between the 2D contours and the 3D contours. Next step is optimization of the initial solution. Lastly deformation of the optimized solution is done by applying Kriging algorithm to the optimized solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laporte |first1=S |last2=Skalli |first2=W |last3=de Guise |first3=JA |last4=Lavaste |first4=F |last5=Mitton |first5=D |year=2003 |title=A biplanar reconstruction method based on 2D and 3D contours: application to distal femur|journal=Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastien_Laporte2/publication/10868711_A_Biplanar_Reconstruction_Method_Based_on_2D_and_3D_Contours_Application_to_the_Distal_Femur/links/0912f50dc38102144b000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by iterating the final step until the distance between two set points is superior to a given precision value the reconstructed object is obtained.

The advantage of this method is it can be used for bony structures with continuous shape and it also reduced human intervention but they are time consuming.

==== 3) Surface Rendering technique ====
Surface Rendering technique visualizes a 3D object as a set of surfaces called iso-surfaces. Each surface has points with the same intensity (called iso-value). It is used when we want to see the separated structures e.g. skull from slices of head, blood vessel system from slices of body etc. This technique is used mostly for high contrast data. Two main methods for reconstructing are:

*Contour based reconstruction: Iso-contours are attached to form iso-surfaces&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=G.Scott Owen, HyperVis. ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee, the National Science Foundation (DUE-9752398), and the Hypermedia and Visualization Laboratory, Georgia State University.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voxel based reconstruction: Voxels having same intensity values are used to form iso-surfaces. One popular algorithm is Marching Cubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some similar algorithms as Marching Tetrahedrons, Dividing Cubes &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can be considered.

Other proposed or developed techniques include Statistical Shape Model Based Methods, Parametric Methods, Hybrid methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">'''''An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping''''', more commonly known simply as '''''An Agenda for Peace''''', is a report written for the [[United Nations]] by Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in 1992.  In it, Boutros-Ghali responds to a request by the UN [[Security Council]] for an "analysis and recommendations" to strengthen peacemaking and peace-keeping.  The document outlines the way Boutros-Ghali felt the UN should respond to conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world.

Recognizing the limitations of [[peacekeeping]], especially as such efforts were becoming prevalent in the early 1990s, the UN Security Council convened in 1992 in a first-time meeting of heads of state.  The 15 members finished the conference by issuing a statement calling on then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to write a report recommending future reforms.  In their statement, the heads-of-state recognized that, &lt;blockquote&gt;“The absence of war and military conflicts amongst States does not in itself ensure international peace and security.  The non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and [[ecological]] fields have become threats to peace and security.  The United Nations membership as a whole, working through the appropriate bodies, needs to give the highest priority to the solution of these matters.”&lt;ref name=intro&gt;UN Department of Public Information, Yearbook of the United Nations 1992, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Security Council saw what many critics of peacekeeping have suggested, and some recent failures had made obvious: peacekeeping alone, as then practiced, was not enough to ensure lasting peace.
	
Boutros-Ghali submitted his response some months later, in the form of ''An Agenda for Peace''.  In it, he outlined a number of additional processes of preventative diplomacy the international community could use before peacekeeping, or simultaneously.  He also suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] to justify military involvement without the consent of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Doyle, "Discovering the Limits and Potential of Peacekeeping," 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, these concepts had not been formally addressed by the UN's leadership.  However, ''An Agenda for Peace''’s most significant contribution to the modern understanding of peace is its introduction of the concept of “post-conflict [[peacebuilding]].”  Boutros-Ghali defines “post-conflict peace-building” as “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.”&lt;ref&gt;Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "An Agenda for Peace,” II.21.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
The concept of post-conflict peacebuilding has been especially important in the academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].  It has been adopted by a number of scholars to suggest a framework for peace that addresses not only the latent forms of physical violence, but also aspects of a society that are structurally violent, and could lead to a re-emergence of fighting (see the discussion of [[Peace and conflict studies#Conceptions of peace|positive peace]] in the article on [[peace and conflict studies]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18974">{{about|attenuation in physics|other uses|Attenuation (disambiguation)}}

In [[physics]], '''attenuation''' or, in some contexts, '''extinction''' is the gradual loss of [[flux]] intensity through a [[Transmission medium|medium]]. For instance, dark [[glasses]] attenuate [[sunlight]], [[lead]] attenuates [[X-ray]]s, and [[water]] and [[air]] attenuate both [[light]] and [[sound]] at variable attenuation rates.

[[Hearing protectors]] help reduce [[Sound power|acoustic flux]] from flowing into the ears. This phenomenon is called [[acoustic attenuation]] and is measured in [[decibel]]s (dBs).

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[telecommunication]]s, attenuation affects the [[Wave propagation|propagation of waves]] and [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] in [[electrical circuit]]s, in [[optical fiber]]s, and in air. [[Attenuator (electronics)|Electrical attenuator]]s and [[optical attenuator]]s are commonly manufactured components in this field.

== Background ==
[[Image:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|Frequency-dependent attenuation of electromagnetic radiation in standard atmosphere.]]
In many cases, attenuation is an [[exponential function]] of the path length through the medium. In chemical [[spectroscopy]], this is known as the [[Beer–Lambert law]]. In engineering, attenuation is usually measured in units of [[decibel]]s per unit length of medium (dB/cm, dB/km, etc.) and is represented by the attenuation [[coefficient]] of the medium in question.&lt;ref name=Zagzebski&gt;Essentials of Ultrasound Physics, James A. Zagzebski, Mosby Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Attenuation also occurs in [[earthquake]]s; when the [[seismic waves]] move farther away from the [[hypocenter]], they grow smaller as they are attenuated by the [[Earth|ground]].

==Ultrasound==
{{main|Acoustic attenuation}}
One area of research in which attenuation plays a prominent role, is in [[ultrasound]] physics. Attenuation in ultrasound is the reduction in amplitude of the ultrasound beam as a function of distance through the imaging medium. Accounting for attenuation effects in ultrasound is important because a reduced signal amplitude can affect the quality of the image produced. By knowing the attenuation that an ultrasound beam experiences traveling through a medium, one can adjust the input signal amplitude to compensate for any loss of energy at the desired imaging depth.&lt;ref name="Bushong"&gt;Diagnostic Ultrasound, Stewart C. Bushong and Benjamin R. Archer, Mosby Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ultrasound attenuation'' measurement in [[heterogeneous]] systems, like [[emulsion]]s or [[colloid]]s, yields information on [[particle size distribution]]. There is an ISO standard on this technique.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 20998-1:2006 "Measurement and characterization of particles by acoustic methods"&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ultrasound attenuation'' can be used for [[extensional rheology]] measurement. There are [[acoustic rheometer]]s that employ [[Stokes' law of sound attenuation|Stokes' law]] for measuring [[extensional viscosity]] and [[volume viscosity]].

Wave equations which take acoustic attenuation into account can be written on a fractional derivative form, see the article on [[acoustic attenuation]] or e.g. the survey paper.&lt;ref name="Nasholm"&gt;S. P. Näsholm and S. Holm, "On a Fractional Zener Elastic Wave Equation," Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. Vol. 16, No 1 (2013), pp. 26–50, {{doi|10.2478/s13540-013--0003-1}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4024 Link to e-print]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attenuation coefficient===
{{Main|Attenuation coefficient}}
[[Attenuation coefficient]]s are used to quantify different media according to how strongly the transmitted ultrasound amplitude decreases as a function of frequency. The attenuation [[coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) can be used to determine total attenuation in [[decibel|dB]] in the medium using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Attenuation} = \alpha [\text{dB}/(\text{MHz} \cdot \text{cm})] \cdot \ell [\text{cm}] \cdot \text{f}[\text{MHz}]&lt;/math&gt;

Attenuation is linearly dependent on the medium length and attenuation coefficient, and also –approximately– on the [[frequency]] of the incident ultrasound beam for biological tissue
(while for simpler media, such as air, the relationship is [[ Stokes's_law_of_sound_attenuation| quadratic]]). Attenuation coefficients vary widely for different media. In biomedical ultrasound imaging however, biological materials and water are the most commonly used media. The attenuation coefficients of common biological materials at a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz are listed below:&lt;ref name="Culjat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culjat |first1=Martin O. |last2=Goldenberg |first2=David |last3=Tewari |first3=Priyamvada |last4=Singh |first4=Rahul S. |year=2010 |title=A Review of Tissue Substitutes for Ultrasound Imaging |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=36 |pmid=20510184 |issue=6 |pages=861–873 |url=http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(10)00075-X |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416030037/http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(10)00075-X |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.02.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two general ways of acoustic energy losses: [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]] and [[scattering]], for instance [[light scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bohren, C. F. and Huffman, D.R. "Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles", Wiley, (1983), {{ISBN|0-471-29340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound propagation through [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] media is associated only with absorption and can be characterized with [[absorption coefficient]] only. Propagation through [[heterogeneous]] media requires taking into account scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids", Elsevier, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Fractional derivative wave equations can be applied for modeling of lossy acoustical wave propagation, see also [[acoustic attenuation]] and Ref.&lt;ref name="Nasholm"/&gt;

==Light attenuation in water==
[[Shortwave radiation]] emitted from the sun have wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]] of light that range from 360&amp;nbsp;nm (violet) to 750&amp;nbsp;nm (red). When the sun's radiation reaches the sea-surface, the shortwave radiation is attenuated by the water, and the intensity of light decreases exponentially with water depth.  The intensity of light at depth can be calculated using the [[Beer-Lambert Law]].

In clear open waters, visible light is absorbed at the longest wavelengths first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths are absorbed at higher water depths, and blue and violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths are absorbed last compared to the other wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.

In near-shore (coastal) waters, sea water contains more [[phytoplankton]] than the very clear central ocean waters. [[Chlorophyll]]-a pigments in the phytoplankton absorb light, and the plants themselves scatter light, making coastal waters less clear than open waters. Chlorophyll-a absorbs light most strongly in the shortest wavelengths (blue and violet) of the visible spectrum. In near-shore waters where there are high concentrations of phytoplankton, the green wavelength reaches the deepest in the water column and the color of water to an observer appears green-blue or green.

==Seismic waves==
The energy with which an [[earthquake]] affects a location depends on the running [[distance]]. The attenuation in the signal of ground motion intensity plays an important role in the assessment of possible strong groundshaking. A [[seismic wave]] loses [[energy]] as it propagates through the [[earth]] (attenuation). This [[phenomenon]] is tied into the [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] of the seismic energy with the distance. There are two types of [[Dissipation|dissipated]] energy:

* geometric dispersion caused by distribution of the seismic energy to greater volumes
* dispersion as heat, also called intrinsic attenuation or anelastic attenuation.

==Electromagnetic==
Attenuation decreases the intensity of [[electromagnetic radiation]] due to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[scattering]] of [[photon]]s.  Attenuation does not include the decrease in intensity due to [[inverse-square law]] geometric spreading.  Therefore, calculation of the total change in intensity involves both the inverse-square law and an estimation of attenuation over the path.

The primary causes of attenuation in matter are the [[photoelectric effect]], [[compton scattering]], and, for photon energies of above 1.022 MeV, [[pair production]].

===Radiography===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

The beam of X-ray is attenuated when photons are absorbed when the x-ray beam passes through the tissue. Interaction with matter varies between high energy photons and low energy photons. Photons travelling at higher energy are more capable of travelling through a tissue specimen as they have less chances of interacting with matter. This is mainly due to the photoelectric effect which states that "the probability of photoelectric absorption is approximately proportional to (Z/E)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where Z is the atomic number of the tissue atom and E is the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xrayphysics.com/attenuation.html|title=X-Ray Physics: X-Ray Interaction with Matter, X-Ray Contrast, and Dose - XRayPhysics|website=xrayphysics.com|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of this, an increase in photon energy (E) will result in a rapid decrease in the interaction with matter.

===Optics===
{{main|Transparent materials}}

Attenuation in [[fiber optics]], also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance travelled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is typically a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.
Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].&lt;ref name="Vardeny"&gt;Telecommunications: A Boost for Fibre Optics, Z. Valy Vardeny, Nature 416, 489–491, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attenuation in fiber optics can be quantified using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm
 |title=Fibre Optics|publisher=Bell College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224231950/http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm |archivedate = 2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 10\times\log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{Input intensity (W)}}{\text{Output intensity (W)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Light scattering ====
[[Image:Reflection angles.svg|frame|Specular reflection]]
[[Image:Diffuse reflection.PNG|thumb|right|Diffuse reflection]]
The propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level of the glass, can cause light rays to be reflected in many random directions. This type of reflection is referred to as "[[diffuse reflection]]", and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles. Most objects that can be seen with the naked eye are visible due to diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is "[[light scattering]]". Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.
&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Kerker, M.
|title=The Scattering of Light (Academic, New York)
|year=1909
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Mandelstam, L.I.
|title=Light Scattering by Inhomogeneous Media

|page=381

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Light scattering from many common surfaces can be modelled by [[lambertian reflectance]].

Light scattering depends on the [[wavelength]] of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident lightwave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific microstructural feature. For example, since [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] has a wavelength scale on the order of one [[micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter), scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.

Thus, attenuation results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at internal [[Interface (matter)|surface]]s and [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]s. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of [[transparent materials|transparent ceramic materials]].

Likewise, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular-level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, "domains" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building-blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are microstructural defects that will provide the most ideal locations for the occurrence of light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, P.S. and Bennett, H.E., "Scattering from infrared missile domes", Opt. Engr., Vol. 17, p.647 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UV-Vis-IR absorption ====
In addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:

* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.
* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.

The selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integral multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.

===Applications===
In [[optical fiber]]s, attenuation is the rate at which the signal light decreases in intensity.  For this reason, glass fiber (which has a low attenuation) is used for long-distance fiber optic cables; plastic fiber has a higher attenuation and, hence, shorter range.  There also exist [[optical attenuator]]s that decrease the signal in a fiber optic cable intentionally.

Attenuation of light is also important in [[physical oceanography]].  This same effect is an important consideration in [[weather radar#Attenuation|weather radar]], as raindrops absorb a part of the emitted beam that is more or less significant, depending on the wavelength used.

Due to the damaging effects of high-energy photons, it is necessary to know how much energy is deposited in tissue during diagnostic treatments involving such radiation. In addition, gamma radiation is used in [[cancer treatments]] where it is important to know how much energy will be deposited in healthy and in tumorous tissue.

===Radio===
{{main|Path loss}}
Attenuation is an important consideration in the modern world of wireless [[telecommunication]].  Attenuation limits the range of radio signals and is affected by the materials a signal must travel through (e.g., air, wood, concrete, rain).  See the article on [[path loss]] for more information on signal loss in wireless communication.

An '''automated dispensing cabinet''' ('''ADC''') is a computerized drug storage device or cabinet designed for hospitals. ADCs allow medications to be stored and dispensed near the [[point of care]] while controlling and tracking drug distribution. They also are called unit-based cabinets (UBCs), automated dispensing devices (ADDs), automated distribution cabinets or automated dispensing machines (ADMs).&lt;ref name=ISMP&gt;{{cite report |title=Guidance on the Interdisciplinary Safe Use of Automated Dispensing Cabinets |publisher=Institute for Safe Medication Practices |date=2008 |url=https://www.ismp.org/Tools/guidelines/ADC_Guidelines_Final.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

==Overview==
Hospital pharmacies have traditionally provided medications for patients by filling patient-specific cassettes of unit-dose medications that were then delivered to the nursing unit and stored in medication cabinets or carts. ADCs, which are designed to replace non-automated floor stock storage, were introduced in hospitals in the 1980s and have facilitated the transition to alternative delivery models and more decentralized medication distribution systems.&lt;ref name=ISMP /&gt;

While no one method for medication distribution works for every facility, implementing automated dispensing cabinets as part of a decentralized or hybrid medication distribution system can improve patient safety and the accountability of the inventory, streamline certain billing processes, and ultimately, lead to increased nursing and patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name=PPPmag&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pppmag.com/documents/V3N6/BuyersGuideP24.pdf |format=PDF |title=Special PP&amp;P Buyer's Guide: Automated Dispensing Cabinets |magazine=Pharmacy Purchasing &amp; Products Magazine |date=September 2006 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=2,4 |publisher=Ridgewood Medical Media LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because automated dispensing cabinets track user access and dispensed medications, their use can improve control over medication inventory. The real-time inventory reports generated by many cabinets can simplify the fill process and help pharmacy track expired drugs. Furthermore, by restricting individual drugs – such as high-risk medications and controlled substances – to unique drawers within the cabinet, overall inventory management, patient safety, and medication security can be improved. Automated dispensing cabinets allow the pharmacy department to profile physician orders before they are dispensed.&lt;ref name=PPPmag /&gt;

Automated cabinets can also enable providers to record medication charges upon dispensing, reducing the billing paperwork pharmacy is responsible for. In addition, nurses can note returned medications using the cabinets' computers, enabling direct credits to patients' accounts. Since automated cabinets can be located on the nursing unit floor, nursing have speedier access to a patient's medications. Decreased wait time for medication can lead to less frustration for nursing staff and prevent conflict between the pharmacy and nursing staff. Also, shorter waiting time ensures improved patient comfort and care.&lt;ref name= PPPmag /&gt;

==Role of automated dispensing in healthcare==
Automated dispensing is a pharmacy practice in which a device dispenses medications and fills prescriptions. Automated dispensing cabinets, which can potentially handle hundreds of different medications are available from a number of manufacturers. Though members of the pharmacy community have been utilizing automation technology since the 1980s, companies are constantly refining and improving ADCs to meet changing needs and health standards in the industry.

Several goals can be met by implementing an automated solution in a healthcare facility. The most important thing a hospital pharmacy should enforce is [[patient safety]]. Wrong drug and wrong dose errors are the most common errors associated with ADC use. Look-alike drug names and drug packages are common variables that lead to selection errors. For example, [[morphine]] and [[hydromorphone]] are two different [[opioid analgesic]]s that frequently get confused.&lt;ref name=ISMP /&gt;

==Key features==
ADCs are more than [[automated teller machines]] for drugs and reflect how design advances as well as, specific technologies, such as [[barcode]] scanning and clinical decision support, can improve medication safety. Over the years, ADCs have been adapted to facilitate compliance with emerging regulatory requirements such as pharmacy review of medication orders and safe practice recommendations.&lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/705681 |url-access=registration |title=Automated Dispensing Cabinets: Getting It Right in the Age of Automation |publisher=Medscape |date=10 July 2009 |journal=Topics in Advanced Practice Nursing eJournal |volume=9 |issue=3 |first=Barbara L. |last=Olson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated dispensing cabinets incorporate sophisticated software and electronic interfaces to synthesize high-risk steps in the medication use process.&lt;ref name=Medscape /&gt;  These unit-based medication repositories provide computer controlled storage, dispensation, tracking, and documentation of medication distribution on the resident care unit. Since automated dispensing cabinets are not located in the pharmacy, they are considered "decentralized" medication distribution systems. Instead, they can be found at the point of care on the resident care unit. Tracking of the stocking and distribution process can occur by interfacing the unit with a central pharmacy computer. These cabinets can also be interfaced with other external databases such as resident profiles, the facility's admission/discharge/transfer system, and billing systems.&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techforltc.org/producttype.aspx?id=2702,2511 |title=Automated Medication Dispensing Cabinets |website=Technology for Long-Term Care |date=25 May 2010 |access-date=3 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113163357/http://www.techforltc.org/producttype.aspx?id=2702%2C2511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADCs are designed to meet the exact needs of the nurses and pharmacists that use them. When ADCs are purchased for a facility, the order is customized for whatever the cabinet will be specifically used for.

The drawers are available in a variety of configurations including locked, matrix, and sensing.

The '''central nervous system''' ('''CNS''') is the part of the [[nervous system]] consisting of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. The central nervous system is so named because it integrates the received information and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of [[bilaterian|bilaterally symmetric animals]]—that is, all multicellular animals except [[sponge]]s and [[radiata|radially symmetric animals]] such as [[jellyfish]]—and it contains the majority of the nervous system.

&lt;ref name="Gizurarson S. 2012 566–582"/&gt; The CNS is contained within the [[dorsal body cavity]], with the [[brain]] housed in the [[cranial cavity]] and the spinal cord in the [[spinal canal]].

==Structure==
{{main article|Neuroanatomy}}
The central nervous system consists of the two major structures: the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].
The brain is encased in the skull, and protected by the cranium.&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; The spinal cord is continuous with the brain and lies [[anatomical terminology|caudally]] to the brain,&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; and is protected by the [[vertebra]]e.&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; The spinal cord reaches from the base of the skull, continues through&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; or starting below&lt;ref name="Huijzen" /&gt; the [[foramen magnum]],&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; and terminates roughly level with the first or second [[lumbar vertebra]],&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book|vauthors= Kandel ER, Schwartz JH |title=Principles of neural science|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=Appleton &amp; Lange|isbn=978-0-07-139011-8|pages=338–343|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huijzen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huijzen|first=R. Nieuwenhuys, J. Voogd, C. van|title=The human central nervous system|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-34686-9|pages=3|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupying the upper sections of the [[vertebral canal]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{cite book|last=Estomih Mtui|first=M.J. Turlough FitzGerald, Gregory Gruener|title=Clinical neuroanatomy and neuroscience|publisher=Saunders|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3738-2|pages=38|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White and gray matter===
{{main article|Gray matter|White matter}}
[[Image:1202 White and Gray Matter.jpg|thumb|right|Dissection of a brain with labels showing the clear division between white and gray matter.]]
Microscopically, there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the central nervous system and the [[peripheral nervous system]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The central nervous system is divided in [[white matter|white]] and [[gray matter]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; This can also be seen macroscopically on brain tissue. The white matter consists of [[axon]]s and [[oligodendrocyte]]s, while the gray matter consists of [[neuron]]s and unmyelinated fibers. Both tissues include a number of [[glia]]l cells (although the white matter contains more), which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system. Different forms of glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during [[neurogenesis]] such as [[bergmann glia]], while others such as [[microglia]] are a specialized form of [[macrophage]], involved in the [[immune system]] of the brain as well as the clearance of various [[metabolite]]s from the [[brain tissue]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; [[Astrocyte]]s may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the [[capillary|capillaries]] of the brain. Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate, causing [[gliosis]], a form of neuronal scar tissue, lacking in functional neurons.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

The brain ([[cerebrum]] as well as [[midbrain]] and [[hindbrain]]) consists of a [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], composed of neuron-bodies constituting gray matter, while internally there is more white matter that form tracts and [[commissure]]s. Apart from cortical gray matter there is also [[subcortical gray matter]] making up a large number of different [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

===Spinal cord===
{{main article|Spinal cord}}
[[File:Sobo 1909 615.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the columns and of the course of the fibers in the spinal cord. Sensory synapses occur in the dorsal spinal cord (above in this image), and motor nerves leave through the ventral (as well as lateral) horns of the spinal cord as seen below in the image.]]
[[Image:1508 Autonomic Control of Pupil Size.jpg|thumb|right|Different ways in which the central nervous system can be activated without engaging the cortex, and making us aware of the actions. The above example shows the process in which the pupil dilates during dim light, activating neurons in the spinal cord. The second example shows the constriction of the pupil as a result of the activation of the Eddinger-Westphal nucleus (a cerebral ganglion).]]

From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of [[spinal nerve|spinal]] [[nerve]]s (sometimes segmental nerves&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt;). The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] motor as well as [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent sensory signals]] and stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of senses.
All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem,&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; some forming plexa as they branch out, such as the [[brachial plexus|brachial plexa]], [[sacral plexus|sacral plexa]] etc.&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons, which relay the information out.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal tracts through the "final common pathway"&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; to the [[thalamus]] and ultimately to the cortex.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:1615 Locations Spinal Fiber Tracts.jpg|Schematic image showing the locations of a few tracts of the spinal cord.
File:1507 Short and Long Reflexes.jpg|Reflexes may also occur without engaging more than one neuron of the central nervous system as in the below example of a short reflex.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Cranial nerves====
Apart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the PNS that synapse through intermediaries or [[Ganglion|ganglia]] directly on the CNS. These 12 nerves exist in the head and neck region and are called [[cranial nerves]]. Cranial nerves bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the [[trapezius muscle]], which is innervated by [[accessory nerve]]s&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt; as well as certain [[cervical spinal nerve]]s).&lt;ref name="Moore's" /&gt;

Two pairs of cranial nerves; the [[olfactory nerve]]s and the [[optic nerve]]s&lt;ref name="Purves 2000"/&gt; are often considered structures of the central nervous system. This is because they do not synapse first on peripheral ganglia, but directly on central nervous neurons. The olfactory epithelium is significant in that it consists of central nervous tissue expressed in direct contact to the environment, allowing for administration of certain pharmaceuticals and drugs.

===Brain===
{{main article|Brain}}
Rostrally to the spinal cord lies the brain.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;
The brain makes up the largest portion of the central nervous system, and is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system. The brain is the major functional unit of the central nervous system. While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of [[spinal locomotion]] and can process [[reflex]]es, the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Brainstem====
{{main article|Brainstem}}
The brainstem consists of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], the [[pons]] and the [[midbrain]]. The medulla can be referred to as an extension of the spinal cord, and its organization and functional properties are similar to those of the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; The tracts passing from the spinal cord to the brain pass through here.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

Regulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of the [[blood pressure]] and [[breathing]]. Other nuclei are involved in [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[taste]], [[hearing]] and control of muscles of the [[face]] and [[neck]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the ventral anterior side of the brainstem. Nuclei in the pons include [[pontine nuclei]] which work with the [[cerebellum]] and transmit information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;
In the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei that have to do with breathing, sleep and taste.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The midbrain (or mesencephalon) is situated above and rostral to the pons, and includes nuclei linking distinct parts of the motor system, among others the cerebellum, the [[basal ganglia]] and both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. Additionally parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the mid brain, including control of automatic eye movements.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of pathways for motor and autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial nerves,&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; and autonomic control of the organs is mediated by the tenth cranial ([[vagus]]) nerve.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 98-199 --&gt; A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic control of the body. Such functions may engage the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]], [[pupil]]lae, among others.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The brainstem also hold the [[reticular formation]], a group of nuclei involved in both [[arousal]] and [[alertness]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

====Cerebellum====
{{main article|Cerebellum}}
The cerebellum lies behind the pons. The cerebellum is composed of several dividing fissures and lobes. Its function includes the control of posture, and the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including the eyes and head as well as the limbs. Further it is involved in motion that has been learned and perfected though practice, and will adapt to new learned movements.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;
Despite its previous classification as a motor structure, the cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved in language as well as [[cognition|cognitive functions]]. These connections have been shown by the use of [[medical imaging]] techniques such as [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the brain including that of the larger [[cerebrum]] (or cerebral hemispheres), but is also more extensively understood than other structures of the brain, and includes fewer types of different neurons.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt; It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor information as well as balance information from the [[vestibular organ]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

====Diencephalon====
{{main article|Diencephalon|Thalamus|Hypothalamus}}
The two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the peripheral nervous system as well as the optical nerve (though it does not receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. Previously it was considered only a "relay station", but it is engaged in the sorting of information that will reach cerebral hemispheres ([[neocortex]]).&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

Apart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus also connects the cerebellum and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. In common with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is involved in wakefullness and consciousness, such as though the [[Suprachiasmatic nucleus|SCN]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or feelings such as [[hunger]], [[thirst]] and [[maternal bond]]ing. This is regulated partly through control of secretion of [[hormone]]s from the [[pituitary gland]]. Additionally the hypothalamus plays a role in [[motivation]] and many other behaviors of the individual.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

====Cerebrum====
{{main article|Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex|Basal ganglia|Amygdala|Hippocampus}}
The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain. Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres, among others: the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

Connecting each of the hemispheres is the [[corpus callosum]] as well as several additional [[commissure]]s.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;
One of the most important parts of the cerebral hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering the surface of the brain. Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying out of everyday tasks.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

The hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role in perception and communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a major role in the coordination of voluntary movement.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

===Difference from the peripheral nervous system===
[[File:1205 Somatic Autonomic Enteric StructuresN.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A map over the different structures of the nervous systems in the body, showing the CNS, [[Parasympathetic nervous system|PNS]], and [[Enteric nervous system|ENS]].]]

This differentiates the central nervous system from the peripheral nervous system, which consists of neurons, axons and [[Schwann cells]]. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similar functions in the central and peripheral nervous system respectively. Both act to add [[myelin]] sheaths to the axons, which acts as a form of insulation allowing for better and faster proliferation of electrical signals along the nerves. Axons in the central nervous system are often very short (barely a few millimeters) and do not need the same degree of isolation as peripheral nerves do. Some peripheral nerves can be over 1m in length, such as the nerves to the big toe. To ensure signals move at sufficient speed, myelination is needed.

The way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves differ. A Schwann cell usually myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding it. Sometimes they may myelinate many axons, especially when in areas of short axons.&lt;ref name="Moore's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur F. Dalley|first=Keith L. Moore, Anne M.R. Agur|title=Clinically oriented anatomy|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Wolters Kluwer|location=Philadelphia [etc.]|isbn=978-1-60547-652-0|pages=48–55,464,700,822,824,1075|edition=6th ed., [International ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oligodendrocytes usually myelinate several axons. They do this by sending out thin projections of their [[cell membrane]] which envelop and enclose the axon.

{{Main article|Neural development}}
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal [[neural groove|groove]] on the [[neural plate]] gradually deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the [[neural folds]]) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a closed tube called the [[neural tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neural tube is called [[neurulation]].  At this stage, the walls of the neural tube contain proliferating [[neural stem cells]] in a region called the [[ventricular zone]].  The neural stem cells, principally [[radial glial cell]]s, multiply and generate [[neuron]]s through the process of [[neurogenesis]], forming the rudiment of the central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=October 2009|volume=10|issue=10|pages=724–35|pmid=19763105|doi=10.1038/nrn2719|pmc=2913577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neural tube]] gives rise to both [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  The anterior (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain [[Vesicle (embryology)|vesicles]] (pockets): the [[prosencephalon]] at the front, the [[mesencephalon]], and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the [[rhombencephalon]]. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the [[telencephalon]] and [[diencephalon]]; and the rhombencephalon divides into the [[metencephalon]] and [[myelencephalon]].  The spinal cord is derived from the posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.

As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[neocortex]], and its cavity becomes the [[lateral ventricles|first and second ventricles]]. Diencephalon elaborations include the [[subthalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]] and [[epithalamus]], and its cavity forms the [[third ventricle]]. The [[tectum]], [[pretectum]], [[cerebral peduncle]] and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct). The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]], the myelencephalon forms the [[medulla oblongata]], and their cavities develop into the [[fourth ventricle]].&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

Their primitive brains, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS. A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mineta K, Nakazawa M, Cebria F, Ikeo K, Agata K, Gojobori T | title = Origin and evolutionary process of the CNS elucidated by comparative genomics analysis of planarian ESTs | journal = PNAS | volume = 100 | issue = 13 | pages = 7666–7671 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12802012 | pmc = 164645 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332513100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7666.full.pdf+html?sid=b2a914e7-5647-4ee2-835c-bc54c4927a98 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924133841/http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7666.full.pdf+html?sid=b2a914e7-5647-4ee2-835c-bc54c4927a98 | archivedate = 24 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like planarians, vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS, though more complex than those of planarians.

====Arthropoda====
In [[arthropods]], the [[ventral nerve cord]], the [[subesophageal ganglia]] and the [[supraesophageal ganglia]] are usually seen as making up the CNS.
{{see also|Lateral horn of insect brain}}

====Chordata====
The CNS of [[chordate]]s differs from that of other animals in being placed dorsally in the body, above the gut and [[notochord]]/[[Vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref name=Romer&gt;Romer, A.S. (1949): ''The Vertebrate Body.'' W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia. (2nd ed. 1955; 3rd ed. 1962; 4th ed. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of [[vertebrate]]s and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive telencephalisation: the [[telencephalon]] of reptiles is only an appendix to the large [[olfactory bulb]], while in mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the [[diencephalon]] and the [[mesencephalon]]. Indeed, the [[allometry|allometric]] study of brain size among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained through [[cranial endocast]]s.

=====Mammals=====
[[Mammal]]s – which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and reptiles – are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the [[cerebral cortex]] known as the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name=MarkFBear&gt;{{cite book

Within placental mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans.&lt;ref name=MarkFBear/&gt; In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions.&lt;ref name=MarkFBear/&gt; Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in [[dolphin]]s, possibly related to their complex [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].

==Clinical significance==
===Diseases===
{{main article|Central nervous system disease}}
There are many central nervous system diseases and conditions, including [[List of central nervous system infections|infections]] of the central nervous system such as [[encephalitis]] and [[poliomyelitis]], early-onset [[neurological disorders]] including [[ADHD]] and [[autism]], late-onset [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[essential tremor]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and inflammatory diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]], genetic disorders such as [[Krabbe's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]], as well as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[adrenoleukodystrophy]]. Lastly, cancers of the central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when [[Malignant brain tumor|malignant]], can have very high mortality rates. Symptoms depend on the size, growth rate, location and malignancy of tumors and can include alterations in motor control, hearing loss, headaches and changes in cognitive ability and autonomic functioning.

'''ChIP-exo''' is a [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] based method for mapping the locations at which a protein of interest ([[transcription factor]]) binds to the genome. It is a modification of the [[ChIP-seq]] protocol, improving the resolution of binding sites from hundreds of [[base pair]]s to almost one base pair. It employs the use of [[exonucleases]] to degrade strands of the protein-bound DNA in the 5'-3' direction to within a small number of nucleotides of the protein binding site. The nucleotides of the exonuclease-treated ends are determined using some combination of [[DNA sequencing]], [[microarrays]], and [[PCR]]. These sequences are then mapped to the genome to identify the locations on the genome at which the protein binds.

&lt;!-- Here comes the TOC --&gt;

&lt;!-- End of TOC --&gt;

==Theory==
Chromatin immunoprecipitation ([[ChIP]]) techniques have been in use since 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmour|first=DS|author2=JT Lis|title=Detecting protein-DNA interactions ''in vivo'': Distribution of RNA polymerase on specific bacterial genes|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1983|volume=81|issue=14|pages=4275–4279|doi=10.1073/pnas.81.14.4275|pmid=6379641|pmc=345570}}&lt;/ref&gt; to detect protein-DNA interactions. There have been many variations on ChIP to improve the quality of results. One such improvement, [[ChIP-on-chip]] (ChIP-chip), combines ChIP with microarray technology. This technique has limited sensitivity and specificity, especially ''in vivo'' where microarrays are constrained by thousands of proteins present in the nuclear compartment, resulting in a high rate of false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albert|first=I|author2=TN Mavrich |author3=LP Tomsho |author4=J Qi |author5=SJ Zanton |author6=SC Schuster |author7=BF Pugh |title=Translational and rotational settings of H2A.Z nucleosomes cross the ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' genome|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=446|pages=572–576|pmid=17392789|doi=10.1038/nature05632|issue=7135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next came [[ChIP-sequencing]] (ChIP-seq), which combines ChIP with high-throughput sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=B|author2=F Robert |author3=JJ Wyrick |author4=O Aparicio |author5=EG Jennings |author6=I Simon |author7=J Zeitlinger |author8=J Schreiber |author9=N Hannett |author10=E Kan |title=Genome-wide location and function of DNA binding proteins|journal=Science|year=2000|volume=290|pages=2306–2309|pmid=11125145|doi=10.1126/science.290.5500.2306|issue=5500|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.123.6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the heterogeneous nature of sheared DNA fragments maps binding sites to within ±300 base pairs, limiting specificity. Secondly, contaminating DNA presents a grave problem since so few genetic loci are cross-linked to the protein of interest, making any non-specific genomic DNA a significant source of background noise.&lt;ref name="ChIP-exo patent"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pugh|first=Benjamin|title=Methods, Systems and Kits for Detecting Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0323361.html|work=United States Application Publication|publisher=United States Patents|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these problems, Rhee and Pugh revised the classic [[nuclease protection assay]] to develop ChIP-exo.&lt;ref name=Rhee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhee|first=Ho Sung|author2=BJ Pugh|title=Comprehensive Genome-wide Protein-DNA Interactions Detected at Single-Nucleotide Resolution|journal=Cell|year=2011|volume=147|issue=6|pages=1408–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.013|pmid=22153082|pmc=3243364}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new ChIP technique relies on a lambda [[exonuclease]] that degrades only, and all, unbound double-stranded DNA in the 5′-3′ direction. Briefly, a protein of interest (engineering one with an epitope tag can be useful for immunoprecipitation) is crosslinked in vivo to its natural binding locations across a genome using formaldehyde.  Cells are then collected, broken open, and the chromatin sheared and solubilized by [[sonication]]. An antibody is then used to immunoprecipitate the protein of interest, along with the crosslinked DNA. DNA PCR adaptors are then ligated to the ends, which serve as a priming point for second strand DNA synthesis after the exonuclease digestion.  Lambda exonuclease then digests double DNA strands from the 5′ end until digestion is blocked at the border of the protein-DNA covalent interaction. Most contaminating DNA is degraded by the addition of a second single-strand specific exonuclease. After the [[cross-link]]ing is reversed, the primers to the PCR adaptors are extended to form double stranded DNA, and a second adaptor is ligated to 5′ ends to demarcate the precise location of exonuclease digestion cessation. The library is then amplified by PCR, and the products are identified by [[high throughput sequencing]]. This method allows for resolution of up to a single base pair for any protein binding site within any genome, which is a much higher resolution than either ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq.

==Advantages==
ChIP-exo has been shown to give up to single base pair resolution in identifying protein binding locations. This is in contrast to ChIP-seq which can locate a protein's binding site only to with ±300 base pairs.&lt;ref name="ChIP-exo patent" /&gt;

Contamination of non-protein-bound DNA fragments can result in a high rate of false positives and negatives in ChIP experiments. The addition of exonucleases to the process not only improves resolution of binding-site calling, but removes contaminating DNA from the solution before sequencing.&lt;ref name="ChIP-exo patent" /&gt;

Proteins that are inefficiently bound to a nucleotide fragment are more likely to be detected by ChIP-exo. This has allowed, for example, the recognition of more CTCF transcription factor binding sites than previously discovered.&lt;ref name="Rhee" /&gt;

Due to the higher resolution and reduced background, less depth of sequencing coverage is needed when using ChIP-exo.&lt;ref name="ChIP-exo patent" /&gt;

==Limitations==
If a protein-DNA complex has multiple locations of cross-linking within a single binding event, then it can appear as though there are multiple distinct binding events. This likely results from these proteins being denatured and cross-linking at one of the available binding sites within the same event. The exonuclease would then stop at one of the bound sites, depending on which site the protein is cross-linked to.&lt;ref name=Rhee /&gt;

As with any ChIP-based method, a suitable antibody for the protein of interest needs to be available in order to use this technique.

==Applications==
Rhee and Pugh introduce ChIP-exo by performing analyses on a small collection of transcription factors: Reb1, Gal4, Phd1, Rap1 in yeast and CTCF in human. Reb1 sites were often found in clusters and these clusters had ~10-fold higher occupancy than expected. Secondary sites in clusters were found ~40 bp from a primary binding site. Binding motifs of Gal4 showed a strong preference for three of the four nucleotides, suggesting a negative interaction between Gal4 and the excluded nucleotide. Phd1 recognizes three different motifs which explains previous reports of the ambiguity of Phd1's binding motif. Rap1 was found to recognize four motifs. Ribosomal protein genes bound by this protein had a tendency to use a particular motif with a stronger consensus sequence. Other genes often used clusters of weaker consensus motifs, possibly to achieve a similar occupancy. Binding motifs of CTCF employed four "modules". Half of the bound CTCF sites used modules 1 and 2, while the rest used some combination of the four. It is believed that CTCF uses its zinc fingers to recognize different combinations of these modules.&lt;ref name=Rhee /&gt;

Rhee and Pugh analyzed pre-initiation complex (PIC) structure and organization in ''Saccharomyces'' genomes. Using ChIP-exo, they were able to, among other discoveries, precisely identify TATA-like features in promoters reported to be TATA-less.&lt;ref name=Rhee2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhee|first=Ho Sung|author2=BJ Pugh|title=Genome-wide structure and organization of eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume= 483|issue=7389|doi=10.1038/nature10799|pages=295–301|pmid=22258509|pmc=3306527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thermodynamics|cTopic=Processes and Cycles}}
In [[electric power generation]] a '''combined cycle''' is an assembly of [[heat engine]]s that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into [[mechanical energy]], which in turn usually drives [[electrical generator]]s. The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), the temperature of the [[working fluid]] in the system is still high enough that a second subsequent heat engine extracts energy from the heat that the first engine produced. By combining these multiple streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator, the overall net efficiency of the system may be increased by 50–60%. (That is, from an overall efficiency of say 34% (in a single cycle) to possibly an overall efficiency of 62% in net [[Carnot cycle|Carnot]] thermodynamic efficiency.)

This can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates (usually less than 50%). In an ordinary (non-combined cycle) heat engine the remaining heat (i.e., hot exhaust gas) from combustion is wasted.

Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles results in improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a [[gas turbine]] (operating by the [[Brayton cycle]]) burning [[natural gas]] or [[synthesis gas]] from [[coal]], whose hot exhaust powers a [[steam power plant]] (operating by the [[Rankine cycle]]). This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) [[thermal efficiency]] of around 62% in base-load operation, in contrast to a single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around 35–42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type. Such an arrangement is also used for marine propulsion, and is called a ''[[combined gas and steam]] (COGAS)'' plant. Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common.

Other historically successful combined cycles have used hot cycles with [[mercury vapour turbine]]s, [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]]s or [[molten carbonate fuel cell]]s, with steam plants for the low temperature "bottoming" cycle. Bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser's heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as [[Finland]]) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such [[cogeneration]] systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.

In automotive and aeronautical engines, turbines have been driven from the exhausts of [[Otto cycle|Otto]] and [[Diesel cycle]]s. These are called [[turbo-compound engine]]s (not to be confused with [[turbocharger]]s).

==Basic combined cycle==
[[File:Basic-cycles.JPG|thumb|right|Topping and bottoming cycles]]

The [[thermodynamic cycle]] of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or [[Brayton cycle]] which is a [[gas turbine]] cycle and the other is [[Rankine cycle]] which is a [[steam turbine]] cycle.&lt;ref name="yahya"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahya|first=S.M|title=Turbines, compressors and fans|publisher=Tata Mc Graw Hill|pages=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle 1-2-3-4-1 which is the [[gas turbine power plant]] cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in high temperature region.

The cycle a-b-c-d-e-f-a which is the Rankine steam cycle takes place at a low temperature and is known as the bottoming cycle. Transfer of heat energy from high temperature [[exhaust gas]] to water and steam takes place by a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler in the bottoming cycle. During the constant pressure process 4-1 the exhaust gases in the [[gas turbine]] reject heat. The feed water, wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a-b, b-c and c-d.

=== Steam generators ===
[[File:Steam-turbines.JPG|thumb|right|Heat transfer from hot gases to water and steam]]
The steam power plant gets its input heat from the high temperature exhaust gases from [[gas turbine]] power plant.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt; The steam generated thus can be used to drive [[steam turbine]]. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: Economiser, evaporator and superheater.

== Design principles ==
[[File:Combined cycle animation.ogv|thumb|Explanation of the layout and principle of a combined cycle power generator.]]
[[File:COGES diagram.svg|thumb|right|Working principle of a combined cycle power plant (Legend: 1-Electric generators, 2-Steam turbine, 3-Condenser, 4-Pump, 5-Boiler/heat exchanger, 6-Gas turbine)]]

The efficiency of a heat engine, the fraction of input heat energy that can be converted to useful work, is limited by the temperature difference between the heat entering the engine and the exhaust heat leaving the engine.

In a [[thermal power station]], water is the working medium. High pressure steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from [[nickel]] or [[cobalt]], rather than inexpensive [[steel]]. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655&amp;nbsp;°C while the lower temperature of a steam plant is fixed by the temperature of the cooling water. With these limits, a steam plant has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.

An open circuit gas turbine cycle has a [[Gas compressor|compressor]], a [[combustor]] and a [[turbine]]. For gas turbines the amount of metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C). The output temperature of the [[flue gas]] is also high (450 to 650&amp;nbsp;°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a [[Rankine cycle]]).

In a combined cycle power plant, the heat of the gas turbine's exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) with a [[live steam]] temperature between 420 and 580&amp;nbsp;°C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or [[cooling tower]]s. This temperature can be as low as 15&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Typical size of CCGT plants ===
Plant size is important in the cost of the plant. The larger plant sizes benefit from [[economies of scale]] (lower initial cost per kilowatt) and improved efficiency.

For large-scale power generation, a typical set would be a 270&amp;nbsp;MW primary gas turbine coupled to a 130&amp;nbsp;MW secondary steam turbine, giving a total output of 400&amp;nbsp;MW. A typical power station might consist of between 1 and 6 such sets.

Gas turbines for large-scale power generation are manufactured by at least four separate groups – General Electric, Siemens, Mitsubishi-Hitachi, and Ansaldo Energia. These groups are also developing, testing and/or marketing gas turbine sizes in excess of 300 MW (for 60 Hz applications) and 400 MW (for 50 Hz applications). Combined cycle units are made up of one or more such gas turbines, each with a waste heat steam generator arranged to supply steam to a single or multiple steam turbines, thus forming a combined cycle block or unit. Combined cycle block sizes offered by three major manufacturers (Alstom, General Electric and Siemens) can range anywhere from 50 MW to well over 1300 MW with costs approaching $670/kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/boston/combined-cycle-gas-fired-unit-costs-coming-in-21948694 | title=Combined-cycle, gas-fired unit costs coming in below expectations: Duke &amp;#124; S&amp;P Global Platts| date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfired boiler ===

The heat recovery boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. Hot gas turbine exhaust enters in [[super heater]] and the [[evaporator]] and then in to economiser section as it flows out from the [[boiler]].
Feed water comes in through the economizer and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If the temperature of the gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;

=== Dual pressure boiler===
[[File:Dual-cycle.jpg|thumb|center|Steam turbine plant lay out with dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

It is often desirable if high heat is recovered from the exiting gases. Hence dual pressure boiler is employed for this purpose.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;  It has two [[water]]/[[steam]] drums. Low pressure drum is connected to low pressure economizer or evaporator. The low pressure steam is generated in low temperature zone. The low pressure steam is supplied to the low temperature turbine. Super heater can be provided in the low pressure circuit.

Some part of the feed water from the low-pressure zone is transferred to the high-pressure economizer by a booster [[pump]]. This economizer heats up the water to its [[saturation temperature]]. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the [[boiler]] and is supplied to the high-pressure [[turbine]].
[[File:Unfired-boiler.JPG|thumb|center|Heat exchange in dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

=== Supplementary firing ===
Supplementary firing may be used in combined cycles (in the HRSG) raising exhaust temperatures from 600&amp;nbsp;°C (GT exhaust) to 800 or even 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Using supplemental firing will however not raise the combined cycle efficiency for most combined cycles. For single boilers it may raise the efficiency if fired to 700–750&amp;nbsp;°C; for multiple boilers however, supplemental firing is often used to improve peak power production of the unit, or to enable higher steam production to compensate for failure of a second unit.

Maximum supplementary firing refers to the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust. The steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration. Hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air. Regenerative air preheater is not required. A fresh air fan which makes it possible to operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation, increases the availability of the unit.

The use of large supplementary firing in Combined Cycle Systems with high gas turbine inlet temperatures causes the efficiency to drop. For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, in comparison to simple Combined Cycle installations. However, they have two advantages that is a) coal can be burned in the steam generator as the supplementary fuel, b) has very good part load efficiency.

The [[Heat recovery steam generator|HRSG]] can be designed with supplementary firing of fuel after the gas turbine in order to increase the quantity or temperature of the steam generated. Without supplementary firing, the efficiency of the combined cycle power plant is higher, but supplementary firing lets the plant respond to fluctuations of electrical load. Supplementary burners are also called ''duct burners''.

More fuel is sometimes added to the turbine's exhaust. This is possible because the turbine exhaust gas (flue gas) still contains some [[oxygen]]. Temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use excess air, above the optimal [[stoichiometric]] ratio to burn the fuel. Often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner and is used to cool the turbine blades.

Supplementary firing raises the temperature of the exhaust gas from 800 to 900 degree Celsius. Relatively high flue gas temperature raises the condition of steam (84 bar, 525 degree Celsius) thereby improving the efficiency of steam cycle.

== Fuel for combined cycle power plants ==

Combined cycle plants are usually powered by [[natural gas]], although [[fuel oil]], [[synthesis gas]] or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. [[Biofuel]]s can also be used. Integrated [[solar energy|solar]] combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look [[Integrated solar combined cycle|ISCC section]]). Next generation nuclear power plants are also on the drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.

The improvement in [[shale gas]] extraction has increased natural gas supplies and reserves dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this fact, it is becoming the fuel of choice for an increasing amount of private investors and consumers because it is more versatile than coal or oil and can be used in 90% of energy applications. Chile which once depended on hydro-power for 70% of its electricity supply, is now boosting its gas supplies to reduce reliance on its drought afflicted hydro dams. Similarly China is tapping its gas reserves to reduce reliance on coal, which is currently burned to generate 80% of the country's electricity supply.

Where the extension of a gas pipeline is impractical or cannot be economically justified, electricity needs in remote areas can be met with small-scale Combined Cycle Plants, using renewable fuels.
Instead of natural gas, Combined Cycle Plants can be filled with biogas derived from agricultural and forestry waste, which is often readily available in rural areas.

===Low-grade fuel for turbines===
Gas turbines burn mainly natural gas and light oil. Crude oil, residual, and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment. In addition, ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to 15%. They may still be economically attractive fuels however, particularly in combined-cycle plants.

Sodium and potassium are removed from residual, crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure. A simpler and less expensive purification system will do the same job for light crude and light distillates. A magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present. Fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel-treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable, low-maintenance operation of gas turbines.

== Configuration ==
A single shaft combined cycle plant comprises a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator. In a multi-shaft combined cycle plant, each gas turbine and each steam turbine has its own generator. The single shaft design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators. The multi-shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate in conjunction with a single steam turbine, which can be more economical than a number of single shaft units.

The primary disadvantage of single shaft combined cycle power plants is that the number of steam turbines, condensers and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine, condenser and the rest of the heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical.

The combined-cycle system includes single-shaft and multi-shaft configurations. The single-shaft system consists of one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled to the single generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft. Key advantages of the single-shaft arrangement are operating simplicity, smaller footprint, and lower startup cost. Single-shaft arrangements, however, will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi-shaft blocks. Additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected, using a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) Clutch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssclutch.com/howitworks/100-2SSSPrinciples.pdf|title=SSS Clutch Operating Principle|publisher=SSS Gears Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine.

Multi-shaft systems have one or more gas turbine-generators and HRSGs that supply steam through a common header to a separate single steam turbine-generator. In terms of overall investment a multi-shaft system is about 5% higher in costs.

Single- and multiple-pressure non-reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems equipped with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 540&amp;nbsp;°C or less. Selection of a single- or multiple-pressure steam cycle for a specific application is determined by economic evaluation which considers plant installed cost, fuel cost and quality, plant duty cycle, and operating and maintenance cost.

Multiple-pressure reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;°C.

The most efficient power generation cycles are those with unfired HRSGs with modular pre-engineered components. These unfired steam cycles are also the lowest in cost. Supplementary-fired combined-cycle systems are provided for specific application.

The primary regions of interest for cogeneration combined-cycle systems are those with unfired and supplementary fired steam cycles. These systems provide a wide range of thermal energy to electric power ratio and represent the range of thermal energy capability and power generation covered by the product line for thermal energy and power systems.

== Efficiency of CCGT plants ==

By combining both gas and steam cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. 
The efficiency of the cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. 
So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the [[waste heat]] temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. 
This large range means that the [[Carnot efficiency]] of the cycle is high. 
The actual efficiency, while lower than the Carnot efficiency, is still higher than that of either plant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm "Efficiency by the Numbers"] by Lee S. Langston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/the-difference-between-lcv-and-hcv-or-lower-and-higher-heating-value-or-net-and-gross-is-clearly-understood-by-all-energy-engineers-there-is-no-right-or-wrong-definition.html|title=The difference between LCV and HCV (or Lower and Higher Heating Value, or Net and Gross) is clearly understood by all energy engineers.

The electric efficiency of a combined cycle power station, if calculated as electric energy produced as a percentage of the [[lower heating value]] of the fuel consumed, can be over 60% when operating new, i.e. unaged, and at continuous output which are ideal conditions. 
As with single cycle thermal units, combined cycle units may also deliver low temperature heat energy for industrial processes, [[district heating]] and other uses. This is called [[cogeneration]] and such power plants are often referred to as a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

In general, combined cycle efficiencies in service are over 50% on a [[lower heating value]] and Gross Output basis. 
Most combined cycle units, especially the larger units, have peak, steady-state efficiencies on the LHV basis of 55 to 59%. 
Research aimed at {{convert|1370|C|F}} turbine inlet temperature has led to even more efficient combined cycles and nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) has been reached in the combined cycle unit of [[Baglan Bay power station|Baglan Bay]], a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, using steam from the HRSG to cool the turbine blades. 

In May 2011 [[Siemens AG]] announced they had achieved a 60.75% net efficiency with a 578 megawatts SGT5-8000H gas turbine at the [[Irsching Power Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2011/fossil_power_generation/efp201105064.htm |title= Siemens pushes world record in efficiency to over 60% while achieving maximum operating flexibility |publisher= [[Siemens AG]] |date= 19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Electric]] 9HA was billed to attain 41.5% simple cycle efficiency and 61.4% in combined cycle mode, with a gas turbine output of 397 MW to 470 MW and a combined output of 592 MW to 701 MW. 
Its firing temperature is between {{convert|2600|and|2900|°F|°C}}, its [[overall pressure ratio]] is 21.8 to 1 and is used by [[Électricité de France]] in [[Bouchain]]. On April 28, 2016, this plant was certified by Guinness World Records as the worlds most efficient combined cycle power plant at 62.22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/431420-most-efficient-combined-cycle-power-plant | title=Most efficient combined cycle power plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Chubu Electric]]’s [[Nishi-ku, Nagoya]] power plant 405 MW 7HA is expected to have 62% gross combined cycle efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Air-cooled 7HA and 9HA designs rated at over 61% CC efficiency |publisher= Gas Turbine World |date= April 2014 |url= http://www.gasturbineworld.com/ge-7ha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2018, GE offers its 826 MW HA at over 64% efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in [[additive manufacturing]] and combustion breakthroughs, up from 63.7% in 2017 orders and on track to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ha-technology-now-available-industry-first-64-percent-efficiency-284144 |title= HA technology now available at industry-first 64 percent efficiency |date= December 4, 2017 |publisher= GE Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2017, [[Mitsubishi]] claims a LHV efficiency of greater than 63% for some members of its J Series turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpshq.com/j-series.html Record-Breaking Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference between HHV and LHV===
{{or section|date=January 2018}}
To avoid confusion, the efficiency of heat engines and power stations should be stated relative to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) or Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, to include or exclude the heat that can be obtained from condensing the flue gas. It should also be specified whether Gross output at the generator terminals or Net Output at the power station fence is being considered.

The LHV figure is NOT a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input; it is 11% higher than that. The HHV figure is a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input. If the LHV approach were used for some new condensing boilers, the efficiency would calculate to be over 100%. Manufacturers prefer to cite the higher LHV efficiency, e.g. 60%, for a new CCGT, but utilities, when calculated how much electricity the plant will generate, divide this by 1.11 to get the real, e.g. 54%, HHV efficiency of that CCGT. Coal plant efficiencies are computed on a HHV basis (it doesn't make nearly as much difference for coal burn, as for gas).

The difference between HHV and LHV for gas, can be estimated (using USA units) by 1055Btu/Lb * w, where w is the lbs of water after combustion per lb of fuel. To convert the HHV of natural gas, which is 23875 Btu/lb, to an LHV (methane is 25% hydrogen) would be: 23875 – (1055*0.25*18/2) = 21500. Because the efficiency is determined by dividing the energy output by the input, and the input on an LHV basis is smaller than the HHV basis, the overall efficiency on an LHV basis is higher. So, using the ratio: 23875/21500 = 1.11 you can convert the HHV to an LHV.

So a real best-of-class baseload CCGT efficiency of 54%, as experienced by the utility operating the plant, translates to 60% LHV as the manufacturer's published headline CCGT efficiency.

===Boosting efficiency===

The efficiency of CCGT and GT can be boosted by pre-cooling combustion air. This is practised in hot climates and also has the effect of increasing power output. This is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in front of the turbine, or by using [[Ice storage air conditioning]]. The latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available. Furthermore, ice storage can be used as a means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and, potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods.

The integrated cycle implies that, before combustion, [[methane]] (primer [[natural gas]] component) is mixed with working fluid and converted into [[syngas]] (mix of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO ([[carbon monoxide]])) in a catalytic [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (without an indirect heat supply) reactor by using [[sensible heat]] of the hot working fluid leaving, in the simplest case, the [[gas turbine]] outlet. The largest part of produced [[syngas]] (about 75%) is directed into the [[combustion chamber]] of the [[Gas turbine|gas-turbine]] cycle to generate power, but another part of [[syngas]] (about 25%) is withdrawn from the power generation cycle as [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or their blend to produce chemicals, fertilizers, [[synthetic fuel]]s, and etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Safonov, M.Granovskii, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=1993|title=Thermodynamic efficiency of co-generation of energy and hydrogen in gas-turbine cycle of methane oxidation.|url=|journal=Doklady Akademii Nauk (Rossii), 328(1993) 202-204|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=2002|title=Integrated Scheme of Natural Gas Usage with Minimum Production of Entropy.|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 80(2002)998-1001|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov|first=|date=2003|title=New Integrated Scheme of the Closed Gas-Turbine Cycle with Synthesis Gas Production.|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science, 58(2003)3913-3921|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] benefit owing to this modification is substantiated by [[exergy]] analysis. There are numerous technological options to separate [[syngas]] from working fluid and withdraw it from the cycle (e.g., condensing vapors and removing liquids, taking out gases and vapors by [[Membrane gas separation|membrane]] and [[pressure swing adsorption]] separation, [[amine gas treating]], and [[glycol dehydration]]).

All the environmental advantages of semi-closed [[gas turbine]] cycles as to an absence of [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and the release of non-diluted [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the flue gas stay the same. An effect of integration becomes apparent with the following clarification. Assigning the efficiency of [[syngas]] production in the integrated cycle a value equal to a regular [[syngas]] production efficiency through [[Steam methane reforming|steam-methane reforming]] (some part of [[methane]] is combusted to drive [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reforming), the net-power generation efficiency (with accounting for the consumed electricity required to separate [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]) can reach levels higher than 60% &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; at a maximum [[temperature]] in the cycle (at the [[gas turbine]] inlet) of about 1300&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[natural gas]] integrated cycle with adiabatic catalytic reactor was firstly proposed at Chemistry Department of Moscow State Lomonosov University (Russia) in Prof. M. Safonov (late) group by M. Safonov,[http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-granovskiy M. Granovskii], and S. Pozharskii in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)==
{{Main|integrated gasification combined cycle}}
An [[integrated gasification combined cycle]], or IGCC, is a power plant using synthesis gas ([[syngas]]). Syngas can be produced from a number of sources, including coal and biomass. The system uses gas and steam turbines, the steam turbine operating off of the heat left over from the gas turbine. This process can raise electricity generation efficiency to around 50%.

==Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)==
An '''Integrated Solar Combined Cycle''' ('''ISCC''') is a hybrid technology in which a [[solar energy|solar thermal]] field is integrated within a combined cycle plant. In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ Integrated solar combined cycle plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011857/http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ |date=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic benefits are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/fossil-fuels-solar-energy-the-future-of-electricity-generation/|title=Fossil Fuels + Solar Energy = The Future of Electricity Generation|publisher=POWER magazine|date=2009-01-04|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=1 (paragraph 7)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors limiting the load output of a combined cycle power plant are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the heat recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/energy-topics/pdfs/en/combined-cycle-power-plants/OperationalFlexibilityEnhancementsofCombinedCyclePowerPlants.pdf Operational Flexibility Enhancements of Combined Cycle Power Plants p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic benefits are that the solar components costs are 25% to 75% those of a [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] plant of the same collector surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925233557/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf |date=2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A turbocharged car is also a combined cycle. Bowman of Southampton offer a commercially proven add-on turbocharger which additionally can generate electric power lowering overall fuel consumption by about 8%.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Some versions of the [[Wright R-3350]] were produced as [[turbo-compound engine]]s.

There have been many successful [[turbo-compound engine]] designs particularly for aircraft but their mechanical complexity and weight are less economical than multistage [[turbine engine]]s. [[Stirling engines]] are also a good theoretical fit for this application.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''''The Communities Directory, A Comprehensive Guide to Intentional Community''''' provides listing of [[intentional communities]] primarily from North America but also from around the world. The ''Communities Directory'' has both an ([http://directory.ic.org online])&lt;ref name=onlineDirectory&gt; {{cite web |url=http://directory.ic.org/ |title=Intentional Communities Directory – ecovillages communes cohousing |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |format=Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;and a print edition,&lt;ref name=printDirectory&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Communities Directory |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |issn=1088-8349 |oclc=32605029 |url=http://directory.ic.org/book.php  |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |format=Print }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is published based on data from the website.

==History==
The first version of the ''Communities Directory'' appeared in issue #1 of [[Communities magazine|''Communities'']] magazine&lt;ref name=CommunitiesMagazine&gt;{{cite journal |author=Communities (magazine) |authorlink=Communities (magazine) |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Roth |journal=Communities |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |issn=0199-9346 |oclc=3130385 |url=http://communities.ic.org/ |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |quote=Since 1972, Communities has been the primary resource for information, issues, and ideas about intentional communities in North America – from urban co-ops to cohousing groups to ecovillages to rural communes.

In all, ten versions were published in the magazine over the next 18 years. The [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]]&lt;ref name=FIC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.org/ |title=Intentional Communities – ecovillages, communes, cohousing, coops |author=FIC Web Weavers |authorlink=Fellowship for Intentional Community  |publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) |location=Rutledge, Missouri, USA |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote=Intentional Community is an inclusive term for ecovillages, cohousing communities, residential land trusts, communes, student co-ops, urban housing cooperatives, intentional living, alternative communities, cooperative living, and other projects where people strive together with a common vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; became publisher of the magazine in 1989, and in 1990 released the first self-contained book-format edition of the directory (also distributed to magazine subscribers, counted as double issue #77/78). 

The ''Communities Directory'' is now in its 6th edition. Editions were published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2007. The production cycle has been shortened due to the online collection of data. The 4th edition lists 600 communities in North America and another 130 worldwide. The 5th edition lists almost 1250 communities worldwide.

There is also a companion video ''Visions of Utopia: Experiments in Sustainable Culture'' that outlines the history of intentional shared living and profiles a diverse cross-section of contemporary groups (external link included below).

The Online ''Communities Directory'' database is shared by members of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041130221719/http://directory.ic.org/icdc.php Intentional Community Data Collective] which includes the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] and [http://directory.cohousing.org Coho/US's Cohousing Directory].

[[File:Target set, states and strata in CST.jpg|thumb|Target set, states and strata in CST]]
'''Concept of Stratification''', labelled CST by Prof [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], was proposed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (2016). Stratification, target set reachability and incremental enlargement principle. Information Sciences, 354, 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt; Zadeh states that it is a reform in conventional [[problem solving]] methods by the consideration of a recursive problem solving approach.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018). The Concept of Stratification and Future Applications. Applied Soft Computing.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this concept should not be mistaken with other similar concepts such as [[social stratification]]. CST is not based on social stratification nor related to it. More particularly it is quite different from the previous versions and applications of stratiﬁcation, such as stratiﬁed logic, stratified approach, stratified programming, [[stratified analysis]], among other versions of stratification prior to 2016. This version of stratiﬁcation can handle a range of problems as explained a year after the original proposal by Asadabadi and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018). The Concept of Stratification and Future Applications. Applied Soft Computing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key innovation in CST is that it considers the target first, and then the target is gradually enlarged to include the system which is aimed to receive the target.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2017, July). Logistic informatics modelling using concept of stratification (CST). In Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), 2017 IEEE International Conference on (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; After the system is contained in the enlarged target, the target gradually shrinks to let the system find the target.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. Targets of Unequal Importance Using the Concept of Stratification in a Big Data Environment. International Journal of Fuzzy Systems, 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has similarities to the human mind problem solving &lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R. (2018). The stratified multi-criteria decision-making ([[Multiple-criteria decision analysis|MCDM]]) method. Knowledge-Based Systems.&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be employed widely in [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) in near future.&lt;ref&gt;Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., &amp; Chang, E. (2018).

The '''conservation and restoration of silver objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and [[Silver (household)|personal value]] made from [[silver]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from silver were created for religious, artistic, technical, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface tarnish is the primary concern of conservator-restorers when dealing with silver objects.

== Use of silver ==
[[Silver]] is a [[precious metal]] that has been mined for use as early as 4000 B.C. in [[Anatolia]] (Modern [[Turkey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 History of Silver|url=http://www.925-1000.com/silverhistory.html |publisher=The Silver Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because silver is malleable and durable it has been used for many purposes which include [[jewelry]], tableware, ornaments, [[coin]]s, musical instruments and [[movie film]]. It is often used as a plating on other metals.

==Tarnish==
{{About||additional information|tarnish}} 
All metals, apart from pure gold, will corrode naturally when exposed to elements such as air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberge|first=Pierre|title=Gold Corrosion|url=http://corrosion-doctors.org/MatSelect/corrgold.htm|publisher=Corrosion Doctors|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High relative humidity, moisture, and air pollutants  are common causes of corrosion in metals, including silver.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David|author2=Charles S. Tumosa and Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying science to the question of museum climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silver is known in the chemistry world as a [[noble metal]] which means it is resistant to corrosion, but not completely.  Whether [[silver plating]] or pure silver, the composite of the metal will [[tarnish]] when exposed to air and sulfur.

Tarnish is a chemical reaction on the surface of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver tarnish, the silver combines with sulfur and forms [[silver sulfide]] ( Ag2S ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Home Experiment: Put a Shine on it|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/homeexpts/TARNISH.html|publisher=SciFun|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On some metals, tarnish serves as a protective layer known as a [[patina]] and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.

== Collections care ==
{{Main article|Collections care}}

===Storage and handling ===
Proper handling, storage, and treatment can help prevent deterioration of silver objects.&lt;ref name="Erhardt"/&gt; Metals are best conserved when stored in an even and low humidity atmosphere, ideally at 40% [[relative humidity]] or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver tends to corrode easily when stored in damp, moist locations such as a basement because it will accelerate tarnishing. Some storage boxes contain  materials, such as wood, acidic paper, rubber, and adhesives, that can off-gas corrosive materials. Conservators wear [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]] gloves when handling silver to prevent oils, ammonia, and salts from the skin from corroding the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing interaction with sulfur gases===
Sulfur-containing gases and particulates can tarnish the surface of silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in [[sulfur]]-free tissue paper and store in a tight sealed [[polyethylene]] bag. [[Activated charcoal]] is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it in the bag but not in direct contact with the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquering===
{{About||lacquering|lacquer|other uses|lacquerware}}
[[Lacquer]]ing is the process of creating a hard durable finish on the surface of an object such as wood or metal.
Polished silver is sometimes lacquered to protect against tarnish and to prevent over-polishing. There are different types of [[resin]]s that are used such as Acryloid B-72 and Incralac. If silver pieces are being displayed in the open, such as in a house or museum exhibit case, it is difficult to prevent corrosion from air exposure. A surface coating will prevent or slow tarnishing and is a service done by professionals or conservator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most used coatings is Agateen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Beverly|title=The De-electrification and Re-electrification of Historic Lighting Fixtures at Winterthur Museum|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Conservation|year=2003|volume=42|series=6|issue=3|pages=457–462|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic42-03-006_3.html|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer is applied to a surface that has been cleaned with [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], or [[methyl ethyl ketone]]. Oils from human hands prevent the lacquer from adhering to the silver. Agateen No. 27 ([[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]) and [[Paraloid B-72]] are the most commonly used lacquers however there is a debate which lacquer, cellulose nitrate or acrylic, is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wharton|first=Glenn|title=The Cleaning and Lacquering of Museum silver|journal=Western Association for Art Conservation|date=Jan 1989|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn11/wn11-1/wn11-103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic methods of treating silver ==
The art of crafting objects out of silver, also known as [[silversmith]]ing, has been around for centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items was a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th centuries.

: 1737 - "Clean it now and then with only warm water and soap, with a Spunge, and then wash it  with clean water, and dry it very well with a soft Linnen cloth, and keep it in a dry place, for the damp will spoyle it".&lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cripps|first=Wilfred|title=Old English Plate|year=1967|publisher=Spring Books|location=London|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1679 - "...rubb the [[flagon]]s and [[chalice]]s from topp to the Bottome, not crosswise, but the Bason and patnes are to be rubb’d roundwise, not acrosse, and by noe means use either [[chalk]], [[sand]], or [[salt]]" &lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"/&gt;

Although dated, these instructions are very similar to current methods of cleaning and polishing of silver.

== Current practices ==
The following sections discuss the different methods in which silver objects can be cleaned and polished. Some of the methods described below can cause damage to the surface of the silver, such as scratching or accelerated tarnishing. A conservator should be consulted if there are any questions about the methods below especially when dealing with archaeological, antique or sensitive objects.&lt;ref name=cfs/&gt;

===Museum conservation practices – historical objects===

Water sensitive objects are masked in plastic wrap to avoid getting wet. A [[slurry]] of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) [[calcium carbonate]] and [[deionized water]] is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser&gt;{{cite book|last=Drayman-Weisser|first=T|title=Caring for Your Collections|year=1992|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Incorp|location=New York|pages=109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unpolished and polished silver artwork pieces.jpg|left|thumb|Parts of a silver object from [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] collection, in the process of being polished with [[calcium carbonate]]. An unpolished piece  is on the left and a finished piece on the right.]]

[[Ethyl alcohol]] is sometimes added to the slurry mixture to help dry out excess water.  The slurry mixture is applied throughout the piece until completely polished. Dark tarnish spots are sometimes located on the surface and may need to be polished more than once to remove. Over polishing is an issue with silver and can cause harm to the surface of the metal. After polishing, the silver object is rinsed in deionized water and dried with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=cfs&gt;{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Caring for Silver and Copper Alloy Materials|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/10-02.pdf|work=Conserve O Gram|publisher=NPS|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once cleaned and dried the silver is wrapped in [[acid-free]] tissue paper and placed in a sealed plastic bag. A [[3M]] anti-tarnish strip is also placed in the bag to absorb any sulfur that may be in the air. The tissue paper is used as a buffer to prevent the silver surface coming into contact with the anti-tarnish strip.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser/&gt;

===Waddings===
Waddings are cloths that have been infused with an organic [[solvent]]. Because they contain solvents instead of water, they can be used for polishing metal objects that cannot be exposed to water. Polishing waddings will leave abrasive particles behind and the residue can be  removed using a soft brush or by rubbing the surface with a soft [[linen]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selwyn|first=L|title=Care and Tarnish Removal|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/9-7_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural methods===
The following sections include methods that use natural methods such as water and salt to clean the surface of silver. Some of the methods use heat which may be dangerous to silver tableware such as candlesticks or knife handles. Water trapped in crevices of silver objects can accelerate tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Single Ingredient'' - [[Toothpaste]] is applied with a clean cloth as a gentle abrasive with a soft bristle toothbrush and rinsed in water.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

''Boiling Water Bath'' - The silver object or pieces are placed into an aluminum pot and covered with water. One [[tablespoon]] of salt and [[baking soda]] is added and boiled for three minutes. After cooling, the silver is placed into a warm soapy water mixture and cleaned with a cotton cloth and then dried with a separate cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; 

''Soaking bath'' – A glass roasting pan is lined with [[aluminum foil]] with the dull side facing downwards. The silver is placed atop of the foil and a [[quart]] of boiling water is poured over the pieces with two tablespoons of baking soda. The silver soaks for five minutes and is dried with a clean cloth.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Ellen|title=All Natural Way to Clean Tarnished Silver|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/allnatural-way-clean-tarnished-silver-3214.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical dips===
A popular and quick method for polishing silver is the use of chemical dips. Dips work by dissolving the tarnished surface of the silver at a highly accelerated rate. Many dips are made of [[acid]]s and other agents. Acids are very corrosive and pose a danger to the silver surface as well as to the user. Dips can be harmful to objects with sealed surfaces such as candlesticks, trophies and teapots with hollow components because the chemical could leak into the hollow area and can never be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Jeffrey|title=Silver Care|url=http://www.silversmithing.com/care.htm#Chemical%20Dips|publisher=Society of Silversmiths|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike museum quality polishing, employing a slurry of calcium carbonate and ionized water, dips are quicker and less expensive. However, dips are more abrasive to the surfaces of silver, gold, and other metals. NOTE: Jeffrey Herman confirms this method damages silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tarn-X Tarnish Remover Review and Other Silver Dips - WARNING! |url=http://www.hermansilver.com/tarn-x.htm |website=www.hermansilver.com |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SALIMBENI |first1=RENZO |title=LASER TECHNIQUES FOR CONSERVATION OF ARTWORKS |url=http://www.ace.hu/am/2006_1/AM-2006-1-RS.pdf |publisher=Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”- CNR, |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The above process wil naturally lead to the cleaning of silver, which is passed through lasers to remove any dirt and pollutants.

Polishing wheels, also known as buffing wheels or polishing mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Because silver is soft,  the surface can be easily cut or scratched. The main buffing type used for silver, gold, and plated objects is Canton flannel. This flannel is made of very soft material and will not scratch the plated, lacquered, or other soft surfaces.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Along with buffing wheels, particular compounds are used to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as [[jeweler's rouge]], polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;{{cite web|last=Caswell Electroplating in Miniature|title=How to Buff and Polish: An Introduction to Buffing &amp; Polishing|url=http://www.caswellplating.com/buffman.htm|publisher=Caswell Inc.|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological silver objects are particularly sensitive to mistakes in planning or carrying out conservation restoration. The essential problem connected with archaeological silver objects is brittleness.&lt;ref&gt;Wanhill, R.J.H., 2000, Brittle archaeological silver. Identification, restoration and conservation, Materialen, 16, 30– 5; also NLR Technical Publication NLR.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain objects, such as those that are completely mineralized, nielloed, or gil, are particularly problematic.  When dealing with archaeological objects, reversible processes, such as the use of Paraloid B-72 glue, are preferred to permanent treatments.

Benzotriazole can be used as corrosion inhibitor for archaeological importance. Suitable protective coatings include Paraloid B-72 (or Paraloid B 67 - soluble in white spirit) and Renaissance Wax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="797">'''Constrained-layer damping''' is a mechanical engineering technique for suppression of vibration.  Typically a [[viscoelastic]] or other [[damping]] material, is sandwiched between two sheets of [[stiffness |stiff]] materials that lack sufficient damping by themselves. The ending result is, any vibration made on either side of the constraining materials (the two stiffer materials on the sides) are trapped and evidently dissipated in the [[viscoelastic]] or middle layer.

[[File:Cyathium cross2 ies no letters.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Euphorbia tridentata'', cross-section of a cyathium.]]
[[File:Stamen of euphorbia milii.jpg|thumb|In euphorbia milii-large]]
A '''cyathium''' (plural: '''cyathia''') is one of the specialised [[Pseudanthium|pseudanthia]] ("false flowers") forming the [[inflorescence]] of plants in the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'' ([[Euphorbiaceae]]). A cyathium consists of:

* Five (rarely four) bracteoles. These are small, united [[bract]]s, which form a cup-like involucre. Their upper tips are free and in the beginning cover the opening of the involucre (like the shutter of a camera). These alternate with:
* Five (1 to 10) [[nectar gland]]s, which are sometimes fused.
* One extremely reduced female flower standing in the centre at the base of the involucre, consisting of an [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] on a short stem with [[pistil]], and surrounded by:
* Five groups (one group at the base of each bracteole) of extremely reduced male flowers, which each consist of a single [[anther]] on a stem.

The flower-like characteristics of the cyathia are underlined by brightly coloured nectar glands and often by [[petal]]-like appendages to the nectar glands, or brightly coloured, petal-like bracts positioned under the cyathia. The paired petal-like bracts of ''Euphorbia'' section ''Goniostema'' are called ''cyathophylls''. here female to male flower ratio is 1:α

The cyathia are sometimes solitary, but are usually in [[Cyme (botany)|cymes]], [[inflorescences]] of the second order, in pseudumbels, on dichotomously branched stalks or in so-called simple cymes which consist of one central and two lateral cyathia.

In one group of Madagascan species in the sub-family Euphorbia section Goniostema (''E. aueoviridiflora'', ''E. capmanambatoensis'', ''E. iharanae'', ''E. leuconeura'', ''E. neohumbertii'', ''E. viguieri'') there is a tendency for a further pseudanthium to grow from the cyme. Probably as an adaptation to pollination by [[bird]]s, the cyathia have become specialised: Most cyathia have upright cyathophylles which surround them protectively, but render the nectar glands inaccessible. To compensate, between them are naked sterile cyathia whose only job is to produce nectar.

'''Database theory''' encapsulates a broad range of topics related to the study and research of the theoretical realm of [[database]]s and [[database management system]]s.

Theoretical aspects of data management include, among other areas, the foundations of query languages, [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] and [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] of queries, [[finite model theory]], [[database design]] theory, [[dependency theory (database theory)|dependency theory]], foundations of [[concurrency control]] and [[database recovery]], [[deductive database]]s, [[temporal database|temporal]] and [[spatial database]]s, [[real time database]]s, managing [[uncertain data]] and [[probabilistic database]]s, and Web data.

Most research work has traditionally been based on the [[relational model]], since this model is usually considered the simplest and most foundational model of interest. Corresponding results for other data models, such as object-oriented or [[semi-structured model]]s, or, more recently, graph data models and [[XML]], are often derivable from those for the relational model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A website on the Theoretical Foundations of Data Management |url=http://databasetheory.org/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central focus of database theory is on understanding the complexity and power of query languages and their connection to [[logic]]. Starting from relational algebra and [[first-order logic]] (which are equivalent by [[Codd's theorem]]) and the insight that important queries such as [[graph reachability]] are not expressible in this language, more powerful language based on [[logic programming]] and [[fixpoint logic]] such as [[datalog]] were studied. Another focus was on the foundations of [[query optimization]] and [[data integration]]. Here most work studied [[conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]], which admit query optimization even under constraints using the [[chase (algorithm)|chase]] algorithm.

The main research conferences in the area are the [[ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems]] (PODS) and the [[International Conference on Database Theory]] (ICDT).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''''The El Salvador Reconstruction and Development Project''''' is a charitable volunteer project from [[Imperial College|Imperial College London]]'s Department of [[Civil Engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental Engineering]] which was launched in reaction to two major earthquakes that struck the country of [[El Salvador]] in 2001. The project has a voluntary student membership basis and is concentrated in rural, mainly underdeveloped areas of the country.

Team leadership and student involvement interchange on an annual basis with the start of a new academic year. The project is supported by a board of Alumni members.

==History==
{{main|2001 El Salvador earthquakes}}

As a result of the large magnitude [[earthquakes]] that killed at least 844 people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rwarchive/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DFMC?OpenDocument ReliefWeb - El Salvador Earthquake: Emergency Update 02 Feb 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; students from Imperial College London's Civil Engineering Department volunteered to work on a development project from 2002 onwards, to be concentrated in the country's poorest communities over subsequent academic years.

Students from several universities and disciplines have travelled along to El Salvador and worked with the relevant community for 5 to 7 weeks on various development projects. The typical student intake over a particular year varies between 11-13.

Communities helped by the El Salvador Project: [[Estanzuelas]], [[Usulután]] (2002), [[San Emigdio]], [[La Paz Department (El Salvador)|La Paz]] (2003, 2004, 2005), [[Santa Marta]], [[San Vicente, El Salvador|San Vicente]] (2006, 2007), [[Colima]], [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]] (2009)

==Finance==

The project receives most of its finance from company sponsors. From the appointment of a particular year's members to the end of the relevant academic year the student body is further involved in [[fundraising]] events, which in the past has included evening sales and a marathon style run in the Netherlands.
On 17 April 2009 the project competed in the [[JP Morgan]] Good Venture Case competition in New York City, where it won $25,000 to fund its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure JP Morgan - Good Venture Case Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121904/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2009 the project secured a further $15,000 from JP Morgan's online global [https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161900/http://careers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia Give-it-Away] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia JP Morgan - Give-it-Away Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330093609/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia |date=2010-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 Project==
This year's project was based in the community of [[Colima]] in the Department of [[Cuscatlán]]. Two reinforced [[earthquake]] resistant houses were constructed, in addition to a [[retaining wall]]. The design of the houses was presented by the Reconstruction and Development Organization of El Salvador ([http://www.redes.org/ REDES]), a national NGO which works closely with the project and oversees the construction process.

==Future activities==
In association with the [[British people|British]] [[Geological]] Survey [[seismologists]] from among others the Department of Civil Engineering of Imperial College London predict an increasing risk posed by earthquakes in El Salvador in the near future due to rapid population expansion exacerbated by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/locate/soildyn The El Salvador earthquakes of January and February 2001: context, characteristics and implications for seismic risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the floods and landslides in November 2009 that left at least 192 people dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/192-dead-in-el-salvador-mudslides-1944239.html 192 dead in El Salvador mudslides]&lt;/ref&gt; REDES will likely be appointing a specifically badly struck geographical entity for consideration under the 2010 project.

Plans for future improvement that are currently awaiting approval include the expansion of a particular year's activities to cover more than one community, spreading out the construction work by sending over teams outside the summer term period and expansion of the concept of the project to cover communities in the neighbouring countries of [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].

==2014 Project==
The 2014 project will involve the project team travelling to Guatemala for the first time. A house design developed in conjunction with Arup will be tested on an earthquake simulator at the [[Universidad Mariano Galvez|University Mariano Galvez]] in Guatemala City. The team will then construct a second house within a community in El Salvador.

The '''global temperature record''' shows the fluctuations of the [[temperature]] of the atmosphere and the oceans through various spans of time.  The most detailed information exists since 1850, when methodical thermometer-based records began.  There are numerous estimates of temperatures since the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]], particularly during the current [[Holocene]] epoch.  Older time periods are studied by [[paleoclimatology]].

== Satellite and balloon (1950s-present) ==

[[File:Satellite Temperatures.png|240px|thumb]]

{{main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
[[Weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]] measurements of atmospheric temperature at various altitudes begin to show an approximation of global coverage in the 1950s. Since December 1978, [[microwave sounding unit]]s on satellites have produced data which can be used to [[MSU temperature measurements|infer temperatures]] in the [[troposphere]].

Several groups have analyzed the satellite data to calculate temperature trends in the troposphere. Both the [[UAH satellite temperature dataset|University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) and the private, NASA funded, corporation [[Remote Sensing Systems]] [[Remote Sensing Systems|RSS]] (RSS) find an upward trend.

For the lower troposphere (TLT), UAH find a global average trend since 1978 of +0.140&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, to January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|title=MONTHLY MEANS OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE LT5.4|work=UAH|accessdate=26 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717025455/http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Fu et al. found trends of +0.19&amp;nbsp;°C/decade when applied to the RSS dataset.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/nature02524-UW-MSU.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Vinnikov and Grody found +0.20&amp;nbsp;°C/decade up between 1978 and 2005, since which the dataset has not been updated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~kostya/CCSP/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Temperature record of the past 1000 years}}

[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]] measurements can be used to reconstruct the temperature record before the historical period. Quantities such as [[tree ring]] widths, [[Coral#Climate research|coral growth]], [[Ice core#Isotopic analysis|isotope variations]] in [[ice core]]s, ocean and lake sediments, [[Speleothem#As climate proxies|cave deposits]], [[fossil]]s, [[ice core]]s, [[Proxy (climate)#Boreholes|borehole temperature]]s, and [[glacier]] length records are correlated with climatic fluctuations. From these, proxy temperature reconstructions of the last 2000 years have been performed for the northern hemisphere, and over shorter time scales for the southern hemisphere and tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Geographic coverage by these proxies is necessarily sparse, and various proxies are more sensitive to faster fluctuations. For example, tree rings, ice cores, and corals generally show variation on an annual time scale, but borehole reconstructions rely on [[Thermal diffusivity|rates of thermal diffusion]], and small scale fluctuations are washed out. Even the best proxy records contain far fewer observations than the worst periods of the observational record, and the spatial and temporal resolution of the resulting reconstructions is correspondingly coarse. Connecting the measured proxies to the variable of interest, such as temperature or rainfall, is highly non-trivial. Data sets from multiple complementary proxies covering overlapping time periods and areas are reconciled to produce the final reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years ''Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years'' (2006), National Academies Press {{ISBN|978-0-309-10225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

Proxy reconstructions extending back 2,000 years have been performed, but reconstructions for the last 1,000 years are supported by more and higher quality independent data sets. These reconstructions indicate:&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.).

* global mean surface temperatures over the last 25 years have been higher than any comparable period since AD 1600, and probably since AD 900
* there was a [[Little Ice Age]] centered on AD 1700
* there was a [[Medieval Warm Period]] centered on AD 1000, though the exact timing and magnitude are uncertain and may have shown regional variation.

=== Indirect historical proxies ===

As well as natural, numerical proxies (tree-ring widths, for example) there exist records from the human historical period that can be used to infer climate variations, including: reports of [[frost fair]]s on the [[Thames]]; records of good and bad harvests; dates of spring blossom or lambing; extraordinary falls of rain and snow; and unusual floods or droughts.&lt;ref&gt;O.Muszkat, ''The outline of the problems and methods used for research of the history of the climate in the Middle Ages'', (in polish), Przemyśl 2014, {{ISSN|1232-7263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such records can be used to infer historical temperatures, but generally in a more qualitative manner than natural proxies.

Recent evidence suggests that a sudden and short-lived [[4.2 kiloyear event|climatic shift between 2200 and 2100 BCE]] occurred in the region between [[Tibet]] and [[Iceland]], with some evidence suggesting a global change.  The result was a cooling and reduction in precipitation.  This is believed to be a primary cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/apocalypse_egypt_04.shtml The Fall of the Egyptian Old Kingdom] Hassan, Fekri BBC June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paleoclimate (from 12,000 years before present)==

[[File:Holocene Temperature Variations.png|240px|thumb|Plot showing the variations, and relative stability, of climate during the last 12000 years.]]
{{main|Paleoclimatology}}
Many estimates of past temperatures have been made over [[History of Earth|Earth's history]].  The field of paleoclimatology includes ancient temperature records.  As the present article is oriented toward recent temperatures, there is a focus here on events since the retreat of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciers]].  The 10,000 years of the [[Holocene]] epoch covers most of this period, since the end of the Northern Hemisphere's [[Younger Dryas]] millennium-long cooling.  The [[Holocene Climatic Optimum]] was generally warmer than the 20th century, but numerous regional variations have been noted since the start of the Younger Dryas.

== Ice cores (from 800,000 years before present) ==
[[File:EPICA temperature plot.svg|thumb|400px|Temperature estimates relative to today from over 800,000 years of the EPICA ice cores in Antarctica. Today's date is on the right side of the graph.]]
Even longer term records exist for few sites: the recent Antarctic [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] core reaches 800 kyr; many others reach more than 100,000 years. The EPICA core covers eight glacial/interglacial cycles. The [[North Greenland Ice Core Project|NGRIP]] core from Greenland stretchs back more than 100 kyr, with 5 kyr in the [[Eemian interglacial]]. Whilst the large-scale signals from the cores are clear, there are problems interpreting the detail, and connecting the isotopic variation to the temperature signal.

{{main|Geologic temperature record}}
On longer time scales, sediment cores show that the cycles of glacials and interglacials are part of a deepening phase within a prolonged ice age that began with the glaciation of [[Antarctica]] approximately 40 million years ago.  This deepening phase, and the accompanying cycles, largely began approximately 3 million years ago with the growth of continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.  Gradual changes in Earth's climate of this kind have been frequent during the Earth's 4500 million year existence and most often are attributed to changes in the configuration of continents and ocean sea ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14632">'''Knud Jeppesen''' (15 August 1892 in [[Copenhagen]] – 14 June 1974 in [[Risskov]]) was a Danish [[musicologist]], [[composer]], and writer on the [[music history|history of music]].

==Biography==
Jeppesen demonstrated early musical talent at age 10 when he was first encouraged by [[Hakon Andersen]] and [[Paul Hellmuth]], although he was largely self-taught. Completing primary education in 1911, he first worked in Elbing and Liegnitz (Eastern Germany) as an opera coach and conductor. He found employment in Berlin in 1914, but returned to Denmark because of the outbreak of war. In Copenhagen he became a pupil of prominent Danish composers [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Thomas Laub]], and studied musicology at Copenhagen University with Angul Hammerich. He passed the organist exam at the Royal Danish Conservatory of music in 1916. Owing to Hammerich's retirement, there was nobody on the faculty of the university to examine Jeppesen's work; therefore, he submitted his dissertation to the University of Vienna, where it was reviewed by [[Guido Adler]] and Jeppesen was awarded a doctorate in 1922.

He was organist at Copenhagen's [[Ludvig Knudsen|St. Stephens church]] from 1917 to 1932 and at the [[Church of Holmen|Holmen church]] from 1932 to 1947.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergsagel|first=John|title=Jeppesen, Knud|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14267|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught music theory at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] from 1920 to 1947, also serving on its board of directors. In 1946, he was appointed to the new post of professor of musicology at [[Aarhus University]], where he founded (in 1950) an Institute of Musicology which he directed until 1957.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline/&gt; His students included the composers [[Vagn Holmboe]] (in Copenhagen) and [[Bent Lorentzen]] (in Aaarhus).&lt;ref name="WhiteChristensen2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Jean |editor=White, John David|title=New Music of the Nordic Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyUOv6EQrWcC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=31 July 2013|year=2002|publisher=Pendragon Press|isbn=978-1-57647-019-0|pages=17, 61|chapter=New Music of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his retirement in 1957, Jeppesen resided in Italy, enabling him to make several discoveries in Italian libraries culminating in his magnum opus, ''La frottola'' (1968–70), a detailed study and bibliography of [[frottole]], the leading genre of Italian popular, secular songs in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. From 1927 until his death he was active in the International Musicological Society, serving as president from 1949 to 1952. He was also a member (from 1963) of the Italian [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knud Jeppesen|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/knud-jeppesen/|work=[[Enciclopedia Treccani]]|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musicology==
Jeppesen's name is invariably associated with the study of musical [[counterpoint]], particularly in the style of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], of whom he was the leading scholar of his day.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline/&gt; His 1930 work ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'' has been a standard textbook since its appearance in German (1935) and English (1939), and remains in print today (the third and final edition remains untranslated). His doctoral thesis was expanded in 1923 and appeared in English in 1927 as ''The Style of Palestrina and the Dissonance'' – a work which [[Grove Music Online|''The New Grove'']] cites as being the "most distinguished and influential example of [[Musical analysis|stylistic analysis]] at this time".&lt;ref name=GroveOnline-Analysis&gt;{{cite web|last=Bent|first=Ian D|author2=Pople, Anthony |title=Analysis|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/41862pg2#S41862.2.4|work=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His published writings mostly regard music by Italian and Danish composers from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Jeppesen engaged in much primary research – locating early manuscript and print copies of old scores and preparing editions with annotations and commentary. In 1962 he finished the first complete thematic catalog of Palestrina's oeuvre. Among his accomplishments were the discovery of ten previously unknown masses by Palestrina in 1949.

==Music==
Jeppesen's early efforts at composition were poorly received and he turned away from composition in 1919, only to resume after a fifteen-year hiatus. He is known for well-crafted songs set to Danish texts, church music, and motets. He also wrote cantatas, organ music, and an opera, ''Rosaura,'' which was performed by the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] on September 20, 1950. He also made many contributions to Danish hymnology, and his ''Bygen flygter, Forunderligt så sødt et smil'' is a classic with Danish church choirs. His style incorporates his knowledge of early counterpoint but also the style of late Viennese romantics including [[Gustav Mahler]], to whom he was introduced by Guido Adler. From 1916 to 1931 Jeppesen was Nielsen's closest associate, and Jeppesen wrote several important articles about that composer.

This is one of the most diverse groups of [[teleost]]s, containing 801 species in 4 orders, 24 families, and 156 genera.&lt;ref name="Source 15"&gt;Inuoe, Jun, M.

==Description==
Leptocephali (singular leptocephalus) all have laterally compressed bodies&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;Miller, Michael J. “Ecology of Anguilliform Leptocephali: Remarkable Transparent Fish Larvae of the Ocean Surface Layer.” Aqua-BioScience Monographs 2 (2009): 1-94. Web. 2 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; that contain transparent jelly-like substances on the inside of the body and a thin layer of muscle with visible myomeres on the outside.&lt;ref name = "Source 6" /&gt; Their body organs are small and they have only a simple tube for a gut.&lt;ref name ="Source 6" &gt;Fahay, Michael (1983-07-01). "Guide to the Early Stages of Marine Fishes occurring in the Western North Atlantic Ocean, Cape Hatteras to the Southern Scotian Shelf." Journal of Northwest Atlantic Fishery Science 4 (1983): 46-61, 1 July 1983. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from http://journal.nafo.int/Volumes/Articles/ID/14/Guide-to-the-Early-Stages-of-Marine-Fishes-occurring-in-the-Western-North-Atlantic-Ocean-Cape-Hatteras-to-the-Southern-Scotian-Shelf.&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of features results in them being very transparent when they are alive. Leptocephali have dorsal and anal fins confluent with caudal fins, but lack pelvic fins.&lt;ref name="Source 6" /&gt; They also lack [[red blood cell]]s until they begin to metamorphose into the juvenile [[glass eel]] stage when they start to look like eels. Leptocephali are also characterized by their fang-like teeth that are present until metamorphosis, when they are lost.&lt;ref name = "Source 6" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from most [[fish larvae]] because they grow to much larger sizes&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and have long larval periods of about three months to more than a year. Another distinguishing feature of these organisms is their mucinous pouch.&lt;ref name = "Source 15" /&gt; They move with typical anguilliform swimming motions&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and can swim forwards and backwards.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; Their food source was difficult to determine because zooplankton, which are the typical food of fish larvae, were never seen in their guts.&lt;ref&gt;Mochioka, N. and M. Iwamizu (1996). “Diet of anguilloid larvae: leptocephali feed selectively on [[larvacea]]n houses and fecal pellets.” Marine Biology 125 (1996): 447–452. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00353257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leptocephali appear to feed on tiny particles floating free in the ocean, which are often referred to as [[marine snow]]. Leptocephali larvae live primarily in the upper {{convert|100|m}} of the ocean at night,&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; and often a little deeper during the day. Leptocephali are present worldwide in the oceans from southern temperate to tropical latitudes, where adult eels and their close relatives live. American eels, European eels, conger eels, and some oceanic species spawn and are found in the [[Sargasso Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;McCleave, J.D. (1993). “Physical and behavioural controls on the oceanic distribution and migration of leptocephali.” [Abstract] Journal of Fish Biology 43 (1993): 243-273. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1993.tb01191.x.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' was declared as a biological species in 1856, but was later found to be the larva of ''[[Anguilla anguilla]]'', which was declared by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758 and thus has priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=314762|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Leptocephalus brevirostris Kaup, 1856|work=marinespecies.org|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The development of leptocephali can be summarized briefly. The eggs of eels in the Anguilliformes order are quite large compared to those of many other fishes.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; They are about {{convert|1|–|4|mm|um thou}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Once the larvae are newly hatched, the yolk extends posteriorly.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Some larvae hatch with features of the head more developed than others.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The preleptocephalus stage is the period immediately after the larvae hatch.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; During this stage, the larvae do not yet feed externally.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; These larvae typically have poorly developed eyes and few or no teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

The leptocephalus stage of the larvae begins after the nutrients from the yolk have been absorbed and the eyes and teeth are formed.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; At this point, the larvae usually have long forward-facing pointy teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; As the larvae grow larger, the teeth will be replaced by shorter teeth and will increase in number.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The maximum size larvae reach varies from about {{convert|5|–|10|cm|0}} but can be as large as {{convert|30|cm}} or more depending on the species.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; After the leptocephali have reached their maximum size, they enter their glass eel stage. Their laterally compressed bodies tend to become more rounded in this stage.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The head also thickens, the olfactory organ enlarges, and their teeth are lost.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from other fish larvae in their development. In other teleosts (those without leptocephali), the egg hatches and then the larvae get nutrients from a [[yolk sac]].&lt;ref name = "Source 20" &gt;Pfeiler, Edward (1986). "Towards and Explanation of the Developmental Strategy in Leptocephalus Larvae of Marine Teleost Fishes." Environmental Biology of Fishes 15 (1986): 3-13. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, external feeding begins once the yolk sac has depleted.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; The larvae begin to increase in size and develop into a juvenile fish once external feeding begins.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt; In those fish with a leptocephalus stage; however, after hatching and obtaining nutrients from the yolk, the larvae do not begin external feeding.&lt;ref name =" Source 20" /&gt; This is peculiar because the larvae still continue to grow in size.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; From this information, it is concluded that one of the biggest and most basic differences in the developmental cycles of teleosts without leptocephali and teleosts with leptocephali is the food source that the larvae use.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt;

Leptocephali are poorly understood, partly because they are very fragile and eat particulate material instead of zooplankton, and their good swimming ability lets them avoid most standard-sized plankton nets used by marine biologists. A video recording of a naturally swimming leptocephalus filmed at night off the island of Hawaii shows an example of their swimming behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/movie/Ophichthid-leptocephalus-Kona-Hawaii/|title=Ophichthid leptocephalus off Kona, Hawaii - Australian Museum|work=australianmuseum.net.au|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual system==
Two facts are known regarding the visual system of the leptocephali. The first is that they have a rod-dominated visual system.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Scott Michael, Ellis Loew, and Michael Grace (2011). “A rod-dominated visual system in leptocephalus larvae of elopomorph fishes (Elopomorpha: Teleostei).” Environmental Biology of Fishes 92 (2011): 513-523. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that the Synaphobranchidae (a specific family of leptocephali) have telescopic eyes, meaning a tubular eye with a sphere-shaped lens on the top occurs.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt;

==Aquaculture==
Some progress has been made to grow the leptocephali of the [[Japanese eel]] in the laboratory. The goal of that effort is to produce [[glass eels]] through artificial spawning and larval rearing, to be used for aquaculture to produce [[unagi]] for food. Unagi is a popular food in Japan and East Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Leptocephali are rarely used as food, except in some parts of Japan. The leptocephali of the common Japanese conger, ''[[Conger myriaster]]'', are called '''''noresore'''''·[[w:ja:のれそれ|のれそれ]] in [[Kōchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and are often served uncooked to the table, and are eaten after dipping in ''tosazu'' mixed [[vinegar]]. It is a spring seasonal specialty.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tanding &lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;oom &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;nly'' can be used to remember that:
*V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; passes through the &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;uperior orbital fissure
*V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the foramen &lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;otundum

==Pes anserinus==
A mnemonic to remember the muscles that contribute tendons to the [[Pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]] and the innervations of these muscles is SGT FOT (sergeant FOT)
*S- '''S'''artorius 
*G- '''G'''racilis 
*T- semi'''T'''endinosus  (from anterior to posterior). 
*F- [[femoral nerve]] 
*O- [[obturator nerve]] 
*T- tibial division of the [[sciatic nerve]]. 
Notice the order of the muscles (S, G, T) follows the order of the innervating nerves which correspond to those muscles (F, O, T){{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Femoral triangle==
The [[femoral triangle]] is shaped like the sail of a sailing ship and hence its boundaries can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''SAIL'''":
*'''S'''artorius
*'''A'''dductor longus
*'''I'''nguinal '''L'''igament.&lt;ref name="LHC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/389/femoral-triangle-boundaries | title = Medical mnemonics | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order of structures in the femoral triangle is important in the embalming of bodies, as the femoral artery is often exposed and used to pump embalming fluids into the body. The order of this neurovascular bundle can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''NAVY'''":
*'''N'''erve
*'''A'''rtery
*'''V'''ein
*[[briefs#History|'''Y''' -fronts]] (the British term of a style of men's underwear with a "Y" shaped front that acts as a fly). The "Y" is midline (corresponding with the penis) and the mnemonic always reads from lateral to medial (in other words, the [[Femoral Nerve]] is always lateral). 

An alternate to this mnemonic is "'''NAVEL'''" for '''N'''erve, '''A'''rtery, '''V'''ein, '''E'''mpty Space and '''L'''ymph, to include the [[deep inguinal lymph nodes]] located medial to the [[Femoral vein]].{{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Popliteal fossa==

*'''A: '''artery (popliteal artery) 
*'''V: '''vein (popliteal vein) 
*'''N: '''nerve (tibial nerve) 
*'''B: '''biceps femoris  (superior lateral border).  The lateral and medial heads of gastrocnemius form the inferior border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/popliteal-fossa-anatomy-mnemonic|title=Popliteal fossa anatomy (mnemonic) {{!}} Radiology Reference Article {{!}} Radiopaedia.org|last=Niknejad|first=Mohammad Taghi|website=radiopaedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cranial nerves==
There are many mnemonics for the names of the [[cranial nerve]]s, e.g.
* "OOOTTAFAGVSH" is "OLd OPen OCeans TROuble TRIbesmen ABout Fish VEnom Giving VArious ACute/SPlitting Headaches" (a mnemonic that gives enough letters to distinguish between nerves that start with the same letter), or "On old Olympus's towering tops, a Finn and German viewed some hops,"&lt;ref&gt;

==Extraocular muscles==
A good mnemonic to remember which muscles are innervated by what nerve is to paraphrase it as a molecular equation: LR&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cfm?id1=572|work= Medicalmnemonics.com|title=Extraocular muscles cranial nerve innervation|first=Atul |last=Sing|date=August 22, 2000|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''L'''ateral '''R'''ectus - Cranial Nerve '''VI'''
* '''S'''uperior '''O'''blique - Cranial Nerve '''IV'''
* the '''R'''est of the muscles - Cranial Nerve '''III'''

Another way to remember which nerves innervate which muscles is to understand the meaning behind all the Latin words.
* The ''fourth cranial nerve'', the trochlear, is so named because the muscle it innervates, the superior oblique, runs through a little fascial pulley that changes its direction of pull (the [[trochlea of superior oblique]]). This pulley exists in the superiomedial corner of each orbit, and "trochl-" is Latin for "pulley."
* The ''sixth cranial nerve'', the ''abducens'', is so named because it controls the lateral rectus, which abducts the eye (rotates it laterally) upon contraction.
* The ''third cranial nerve'', the ''oculomotor'', is so named because it is in charge of the movement (motor) of the eye (oculo-). It controls all the other muscles.

==G.I. tract layers (simplified)==
===M.S.M.S===
*'''M'''ucosa
*'''S'''ubmucosa
*'''M'''uscularis propria
*'''S'''erosa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/oral/GI_layers.php | title=Four layers of the Gastointestinal Tract | publisher=University of Leeds | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidney functions==
===A WET BED===
*'''A''' – maintaining ACID-base balance
*'''W''' – maintaining WATER balance
*'''E''' – ELECTROLYTE balance
*'''T''' – TOXIN removal
*'''B''' – BLOOD Pressure control
*'''E''' – making ERYTHROPOIETIN
*'''D''' – Vitamin D metabolism

==Lateral geniculate nucleus==
A simple mnemonic for remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is "See I? I see, I see," with "see" representing the C in "contralateral," and "I" representing the I in "ipsilateral." Another is "Emily and Pete meet eye to eye" as in "M and P meet I to I," or again, Magno and Parvo meet Ipsi to Ipsi.

Another way of remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is 2+3=5, which is correct, so ipsilateral side, and 1+4 doesn't equal 6, so contralateral.

A '''microbial mat''' is a multi-layered sheet of [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Microbial mats grow at [[interface (chemistry)|interface]]s between different types of material, mostly on submerged or moist [[substrate (biology)|surfaces]], but a few survive in deserts.&lt;ref name="SchieberBoseEtAl2007AtlasOfMicrobialMatFeatures"&gt;{{cite book | title=Atlas of Microbial Mat Features Preserved within the Siliciclastic Rock Record |author1 =Schieber, J. |author2 =Bose, P, Eriksson, P.

A few are found as [[endosymbiont]]s of [[animal]]s.

Although only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species. In moist conditions mats are usually held together by [[Extracellular polymeric substance|slimy substances]] secreted by the microorganisms, and in many cases some of the microorganisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called [[stromatolite]]s, but there are also spherical forms.

Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good [[fossil]] evidence, from {{ma|3500}}, and have been the most important members and maintainers of the planet's [[ecosystem]]s. Originally they depended on [[hydrothermal vent]]s for energy and chemical "food", but the development of [[photosynthesis]] allow mats to proliferate outside of these environments by utilizing a more widely available energy source, sunlight. The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are [[carbon dioxide]] and water.

As a result, microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free [[oxygen]] is a vital component. At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex [[eukaryote]] type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]], of which all [[multicellular]] organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the [[Cambrian substrate revolution]], when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans.

Because of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as "food", there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution.

{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Stromatolites]] are formed by some microbial mats as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment.]]
Microbial mats have also been referred to as "[[algae|algal]] mats" and "[[bacteria]]l mats" in older scientific literature. They are a type of [[biofilm]] that is large enough to see with the naked eye and robust enough to survive moderate physical stresses. These colonies of [[bacteria]] form on surfaces at many types of [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]], for example between water and the [[sediment]] or rock at the bottom, between air and rock or sediment, between soil and bed-rock, etc. Such interfaces form vertical [[Diffusion|chemical gradient]]s, i.e.  vertical variations in chemical composition, which make different levels suitable for different types of bacteria and thus divide microbial mats into layers, which may be sharply defined or may merge more gradually into each  other.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc"&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=Biofilm, Biodictyon, Biomat Microbialites, Oolites, Stromatolites, Geophysiology, Global Mechanism, Parahistology |author=Krumbein, W.E., Brehm, U., Gerdes, G., Gorbushina, A.A., Levit, G. and Palinska, K.A. |pages=1–28 |title=Fossil and Recent Biofilms: A Natural History of Life on Earth |editor=Krumbein, W.E. |editor2=Paterson, D.M. |editor3=Zavarzin, G.A. |year=2003 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |isbn=1-4020-1597-6 |url=http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106201614/http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf |archivedate=January 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A variety of microbes are able to transcend the limits of diffusion by using "nanowires" to shuttle electrons from their metabolic reactions up to two centimetres deep in the sediment – for example, electrons can be transferred from reactions involving hydrogen sulfide deeper within the sediment to oxygen in the water, which acts as an electron acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature08790| pmid = 20182510| year = 2010| last1 = Nielsen | first1 = L.| last2 = Risgaard-Petersen | first2 = N.| last3 = Fossing | first3 = H.| last4 = Christensen | first4 = P.| last5 = Sayama | first5 = M.| title = Electric currents couple spatially separated biogeochemical processes in marine sediment| volume = 463| issue = 7284| pages = 1071–1074| journal = Nature| laysummary = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/news.2010.90 |laysource=Nature News: Bacteria buzzing in the seabed|bibcode = 2010Natur.463.1071N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known types of microbial mat may be flat laminated mats, which form on approximately horizontal surfaces, and [[stromatolites]], stubby pillars built as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment deposited on them by water. However, there are also spherical mats, some on the outside of pellets of rock or other firm material and others ''inside'' spheres of sediment.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

===Structure===
A microbial mat consists of several layers, each of which is dominated by specific types of [[microorganism]], mainly [[bacteria]]. Although the composition of individual mats varies depending on the environment, as a general rule the by-products of each group of microorganisms serve as "food" for other groups. In effect each mat forms its own [[food chain]], with one or a few groups at the top of the food chain as their by-products are not consumed by other groups. Different types of microorganism dominate different layers based on their [[comparative advantage]] for living in that layer. In other words, they live in positions where they can out-perform other groups rather than where they would absolutely be most comfortable — ecological relationships between different groups are a combination of competition and co-operation. Since the [[metabolism|metabolic]] capabilities of bacteria (what they can "eat" and what conditions they can tolerate) generally depend on their [[phylogeny]] (i.e. the most closely related groups have the most similar metabolisms), the different layers of a mat are divided both by their different metabolic contributions to the community and by their phylogenetic relationships.

In a wet environment where sunlight is the main source of energy, the uppermost layers are generally dominated by [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green bacteria whose color is caused by their having [[chlorophyll]]), while the lowest layers are generally dominated by [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]  [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Community structure of a microbial mat: the phylogenetic dimension |author1 =Risatti, J.

For example, in hypersaline ponds near Guerrero Negro (Mexico) various kind of mats were explored. There are some mats with a middle purple layer inhabited by photosynthesizing purple bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas J. Stal: Physiological ecology of cyanobacteria in microbial mats and other communities, New Phytologist (1995), 131, 1–32&lt;/ref&gt; Some other mats have a white layer inhabited by chemotrophic [[sulfide-oxidizing bacteria]] and beneath them an olive layer inhabited by photosynthesizing [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[heterotrophic]] bacteria.&lt;ref name=layer4&gt;Garcia-Pichel F., Mechling M., Castenholz R.W., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC201509/pdf/aem00022-0118.pdf Diel Migrations of Microorganisms within a Benthic, Hypersaline Mat Community], Appl. and Env. Microbiology, May 1994, pp. 1500–1511&lt;/ref&gt; However, this layer structure is not changeless during a day: some species of cyanobacteria migrate to deeper layers at morning, and go back at evening, to avoid intensive solar light and UV radiation at mid-day.&lt;ref name=layer4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bebout B.M., Garcia-Pichel F., [http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/12/4215 UV B-Induced Vertical Migrations of Cyanobacteria in a Microbial Mat], Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Dec 1995, 4215–4222, Vol 61, No. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial mats are generally held together and bound to their [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]] by slimy [[extracellular polymeric substance]]s which they secrete. In many cases some of the bacteria form filaments (threads), which tangle and thus increase the colonies' structural strength, especially if the filaments have sheaths (tough outer coverings).&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

This combination of slime and tangled threads attracts other microorganisms which become part of the mat community, for example [[protozoa]], some of which feed on the mat-forming bacteria, and [[diatom]]s, which often seal the surfaces of submerged microbial mats with thin, [[parchment]]-like coverings.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

Marine mats may grow to a few centimeters in thickness, of which only the top few millimeters are oxygenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of microbial mats (KOPARA) in the South Pacific atolls of French Polynesia |author1=Che, L.M. |author2=Andréfouët.

===Types of environment colonized===
Underwater microbial mats have been described as layers that live by exploiting and to some extent modifying local [[Diffusion|chemical gradient]]s, i.e.  variations in the chemical composition. Thinner, less complex [[biofilms]] live in many [[subaerial|sub-aerial]] environments, for example on rocks, on mineral particles such as sand, and within [[soil]].   They have to survive for long periods without liquid water, often in a dormant state. Microbial mats that live in tidal zones, such as those found in the [[Sippewissett salt marsh]], often contain a large proportion of similar microorganisms that can survive for several hours without water.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

Microbial mats and less complex types of biofilm are found at temperature ranges from –40&amp;nbsp;°C to +120&amp;nbsp;°C, because variations in pressure affect the temperatures at which water remains liquid.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

They even appear as [[endosymbiont]]s in some animals, for example in the hindguts of some [[echinoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in the burrowing echinoid, ''Echinocardium cordatum'' (Echinodermata) |author1 =Temara, A. |author2 =de Ridder, C. |author3 =Kuenen, J.G. |author4 = Robertson, L.A. | journal=Marine Biology | 	volume=115 | issue=2 |date=February 1993 | doi=10.1007/BF00346333 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hk643302k254181l/  | pages= 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinneyia Grimsby Silurian Niagara Gorge.jpg|thumb|''Kinneyia''-like structure in the Grimsby Formation (Silurian) exposed in Niagara Gorge, New York.]]
Microbial mats use all of the types of metabolism and feeding strategy that have evolved on Earth—anoxygenic and oxygenic [[photosynthesis]]; anaerobic and aerobic [[chemotroph]]y (using chemicals rather than sunshine as a source of energy); organic and inorganic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] (i..e converting food into energy with and without using oxygen in the process); [[autotrophy]] (producing food from inorganic compounds) and [[heterotrophy]] (producing food only from organic compounds, by some combination of [[predation]] and [[detritivory]]).&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

Most sedimentary rocks and ore deposits have grown by a [[reef]]-like build-up rather than by "falling" out of the water, and this build-up has been at least influenced and perhaps sometimes caused by the actions of microbes. [[Stromatolites]], bioherms (domes or columns similar internally to stromatolites) and biostromes (distinct sheets of sediment) are among such microbe-influenced build-ups.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt; Other types of microbial mat have created wrinkled "elephant skin" textures in marine sediments, although it was many years before these textures were recognized as [[trace fossil]]s of mats.&lt;ref name=Manten1966&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manten, A.A. |year=1966 |title=Some problematic shallow-marine structures |journal=Marine Geol |volume=4 |pages=227–232 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(66)90023-5 |url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/geo/2006-1213-210452/UUindex.html |accessdate=2007-06-18 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021003026/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/geo/2006-1213-210452/UUindex.html |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= |bibcode=1966MGeol...4..227M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial mats have increased the concentration of metal in many ore deposits, and without this it would not be feasible to mine them—examples include iron (both sulfide and oxide ores), uranium, copper, silver and gold deposits.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;

===The earliest mats===
Microbial mats are among the oldest clear signs of life, as [[Microbially induced sedimentary structure|microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS)]] formed {{Ma|3480}} have been found in [[western Australia]].&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20131113"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Oldest fossil found: Meet your microbial mom |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |date=13 November 2013 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AST-20131108"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noffke |first1=Nora |last2=Christian |first2=Christian |last3=Wacey |first3=David |last4=Hazen |first4=Robert M. |title=Microbially Induced Sedimentary Structures Recording an Ancient Ecosystem in the ca. 3.48 Billion-Year-Old Dresser Formation, Pilbara, Western Australia |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2013.1030 |date=8 November 2013 |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1030 |accessdate=15 November 2013 |bibcode=2013AsBio..13.1103N |pmid=24205812 |pmc=3870916 |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1103–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that early stage the mats' structure may already have been similar to that of modern mats that do not include [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] bacteria. It is even possible that non-photosynthesizing mats were present as early as {{ma|4000}}. If so, their energy source would have been [[hydrothermal vent]]s (high-pressure [[hot springs]] around submerged [[volcano]]es), and the evolutionary split between [[bacteria]] and [[archea]] may also have occurred around this time.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Archaean metabolic evolution of microbial mats |author1=Nisbet, E.G. |author2=Fowler, C.M.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | date=December 7, 1999 | volume=266 | issue=1436 | pages=2375 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0934 | pmc=1690475 }} – abstract with link to free full content (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mats were probably small, single-species [[biofilm]]s of [[chemotroph]]s that relied on hydrothermal vents to supply both energy and chemical "food". Within a short time (by geological standards) the build-up of dead microorganisms would have created an [[ecological niche]] for scavenging [[heterotroph]]s, possibly [[methanogen|methane-emitting]] and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] organisms that would have formed new layers in the mats and enriched their supply of biologically useful chemicals.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;

===Photosynthesis===
It is generally thought that [[photosynthesis]], the biological generation of energy from light, evolved shortly after {{ma|3000}} (3 billion).&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;&lt;!--

From my memories, the consensus is that it was definitely present 2200Ma, and probably present beforehand. This is worth checking out in other sources if possible – Andy Knoll has written a lot on this subject.

--&gt; However an [[isotope analysis]] suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis may have been widespread as early as {{ma|3500}}.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt; The eminent researcher into Earth's earliest life, William Schopf, argues that, if one did not know their age, one would classify some of the fossil organisms in Australian stromatolites from {{ma|3500}} as [[cyanobacteria]], which are oxygen-producing photosynthesizers.&lt;ref name="Schopf1992GeologyAndPaleobiologyOfArchean"&gt;{{Cite book |  author=Schopf, J.W. | contribution=Geology and Paleobiology of the Archean Earth | title=The Proterozoic Biosphere: A Multidisciplinary Study | editor=Schopf, J.W. |editor2=Klein, C. | year=1992 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-36615-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMPfQoFNr-IC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=microbial+mat | accessdate=2008-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different types of photosynthetic reaction, and [[molecular phylogeny|analysis of bacterial DNA]] indicates that photosynthesis first arose in anoxygenic [[purple bacteria]], while the [[Oxygen#Photosynthesis and respiration|oxygenic photosynthesis]] seen in [[cyanobacteria]] and much later in [[plant]]s was the last to evolve.&lt;ref name="Blankenship2001EvolutionOfPhotosynthesis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular evidence for the evolution of photosynthesis | author=Blankenship, R.E. | journal=Trends in Plant Science | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=1 January 2001 | pages=4–6 | doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(00)01831-8 | pmid=11164357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest photosynthesis may have been powered by [[infra-red]] light, using modified versions of [[Pigment (biology)|pigments]] whose original function was to detect infra-red heat emissions from hydrothermal vents. The development of photosynthetic energy generation enabled the microorganisms first to colonize wider areas around vents and then to use sunlight as an energy source. The role of the hydrothermal vents was now limited to supplying reduced metals into the oceans as a whole rather than being the main supporters of life in specific locations.&lt;ref name="Blankenship2001EvolutionOfPhotosynthesis" /&gt; Heterotrophic scavengers would have accompanied the photosynthesizers in their migration out of the "hydrothermal ghetto".&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;

The evolution of purple bacteria, which do not produce or use oxygen but can tolerate it, enabled mats to colonize areas that locally had relatively high concentrations of oxygen, which is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it.&lt;ref name="Abele2002ToxicOxygen" /&gt;  Microbial mats would have been separated into oxidized and reduced layers, and this specialization would have increased their productivity.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt; It may be possible to confirm this model by analyzing the isotope ratios of both carbon and sulfur in sediments laid down in shallow water.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;

The last major stage in the evolution of microbial mats was the appearance of [[cyanobacteria]], photsynthesizers which both produce and use oxygen. This gave undersea mats their typical modern structure: an oxygen-rich top layer of cyanobacteria; a layer of photsynthesizing purple bacteria that could tolerate oxygen; and oxygen-free, [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]-dominated lower layers of heterotrophic scavengers, mainly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;

It is estimated that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] require a [[reducing agent]], but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses [[water]] as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the top layers of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the [[chemotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] microorganisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes.&lt;ref name="HoehlerBeboutMarais2001MicrobialMatsInProductionOfReducedGasesOnEarlyEarth" /&gt;

Oxygenic photosynthesis in microbial mats would also have increased the free oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, both directly by emitting oxygen and because the mats emitted molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), some of which would have escaped from the Earth's atmosphere before it could re-combine with free oxygen to form more water. Microbial mats thus played a major role in the evolution of organisms  which could first tolerate free oxygen and then use it as an energy source.&lt;ref name="HoehlerBeboutMarais2001MicrobialMatsInProductionOfReducedGasesOnEarlyEarth"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of microbial mats in the production of reduced gases on the early Earth |author1 =Hoehler, T.M. |author2 =Bebout, B.M. |author3 =Des Marais, D.J. | journal=Nature | volume=412 | pages=324–7 | date=19 July 2001 | doi=10.1038/35085554 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6844/full/412324a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pmid=11460161 | issue=6844 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it, but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen-adapted organisms&lt;ref name="Abele2002ToxicOxygen"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Toxic oxygen: The radical life-giver | author=Abele, D. | journal=Nature | volume=420 | issue=27 | date=7 November 2002 | doi=10.1038/420027a | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6911/full/420027a.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pages=27 | pmid=12422197 |bibcode = 2002Natur.420...27A }}&lt;/ref&gt; — for example anaerobic [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] produces a net yield of two [[molecule]]s of [[adenosine triphosphate]], cells' internal "fuel", per molecule of [[glucose]], while [[aerobic respiration]] produces a net yield of 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trc.ucdavis.edu/biosci10v/bis10v/week3/06aerobicrespirintro.html |title=Introduction to Aerobic Respiration |publisher=University of California, Davis |accessdate=2008-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908031611/http://trc.ucdavis.edu/biosci10v/bis10v/week3/06aerobicrespirintro.html |archivedate=September 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxygen#Build-up in the atmosphere|oxygenation of the atmosphere]] was a prerequisite for the evolution of the more complex [[eukaryote]] type  of cell, from which all [[multicellular]] organisms are built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A molecular timescale of eukaryote evolution and the rise of complex multicellular life |author1 =Hedges, S.B. |author2 =Blair, J.E |author3 = Venturi, M.L. |author4 =Shoe, J.L | journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology | doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-2 | date=28 January 2004 | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/2/abstract/ | accessdate=2008-07-14 | volume=4 | pages=2 | pmid=15005799 | pmc=341452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria have the most complete biochemical "toolkits" of all the mat-forming organisms: the photosynthesis mechanisms of both [[Green sulfur bacteria|green bacteria]] and purple bacteria; oxygen production; and the [[Calvin cycle]], which converts [[carbon dioxide]] and water into [[carbohydrate]]s and [[sugar]]s. It is likely that they acquired many of these sub-systems from existing mat organisms, by some combination of [[horizontal gene transfer]] and [[endosymbiosis]] followed by fusion. Whatever the causes, cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of the mat organisms and were well-adapted to strike out on their own both as floating mats and as the first of the [[phytoplankton]], which forms the basis of most marine [[food chain]]s.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;

===Origin of eukaryotes===
The time at which [[eukaryote]]s first appeared is still uncertain: there is reasonable evidence that fossils dated between {{ma|1600}} and {{ma|2100}} represent eukaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Andrew H.| last = Knoll |author2=Javaux, E.J |author3=Hewitt, D. |author4=Cohen, P.| title = Eukaryotic organisms in Proterozoic oceans| journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]| year=2006 | volume=361 | issue=1470 | pages=1023–38| pmc=1578724| doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1843| pmid = 16754612}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the presence of [[sterane]]s in [[Australia]]n [[shale]]s may indicate that eukaryotes were present {{ma|2700}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Archean Molecular Fossils and the Early Rise of Eukaryotes |author1 = Brocks, J.J. |author2 =Logan, G.A. |author3 =Buick, R. |author4 =Summons, R.E. | journal=Science | date=13 August 1999 | volume=285 | issue=5430 | pages=1033–6 | doi=10.1126/science.285.5430.1033 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/285/5430/1033 | accessdate=2008-07-16 | pmid=10446042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still debate about the origins of eukaryotes, and many of the theories focus on the idea that a bacterium first became an endosymbiont of an anaerobic archean and then fused with it to become one organism. If such endosymbiosis was an important factor, microbial mats would have encouraged it. There are two possible variations of this scenario:
*The boundary between the oxygenated and oxygen-free zones of a mat would have moved up when photosynthesis shut down at night and back down when photosynthesis resumed after the next sunrise. Symbiosis between independent aerobic and anaerobic organisms would have enabled both to live comfortably in the zone that was subject to oxygen "tides", and subsequent endosymbiosis would have made such partnerships more mobile.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;
*The initial partnership may have been between anaerobic archea that required [[hydrogen hypothesis|molecular hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and heterotrophic bacteria that produced it and could live both with and without oxygen.&lt;ref name="NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Martin W. |author2=Müller, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote |journal=Nature |volume=392 |issue=6671 |pages=37–41 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9510246 |doi=10.1038/32096 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6671/abs/392037a0.html;jsessionid=C6090FB2CDDA3DA3AD58956BF205BB18 | accessdate=2008-07-16 |bibcode = 1998Natur.392...37M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cambrian substrate revolution | caption=Before and after the [[Cambrian substrate revolution]] }}
The [[Ediacara biota]] are the earliest widely accepted evidence of multicellular "animals".

"mat scratchers", which grazed the surface of the mat without destroying it; "mat stickers", suspension feeders that were partially embedded in the mat; and "undermat miners", which burrowed underneath the mat and fed on decomposing mat material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Seilacher, A. | year=1999 | title=Biomat-related lifestyles in the Precambrian | journal=PALAIOS | volume=14 | pages=86–93 | url=http://palaios.sepmonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/86 | accessdate=2008-07-17 | doi=10.2307/3515363 | jstor=3515363 | issue=1 | publisher=PALAIOS, Vol. 14, No. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cambrian substrate revolution===
In the Early Cambrian, however, organisms began to burrow vertically for protection or food, breaking down the microbial mats, and thus allowing water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface and kill the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms in the lower layers. As a result of this [[Cambrian substrate revolution]], marine microbial mats are confined to environments in which burrowing is non-existent or negligible:&lt;ref name="BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution" /&gt; very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which are uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats;&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005&gt;{{cite journal| author = Seilacher, Adolf|author2=Luis A.

===Current status===
Although the Cambrian substrate revolution opened up new niches for animals, it was not catastrophic for microbial mats, but it did greatly reduce their extent.

==How microbial mats help paleontologists==
Most fossils preserve only the hard parts of organisms, e.g. shells. The rare cases where soft-bodied fossils are preserved (the remains of soft-bodied organisms and also of the soft parts of organisms for which only hard parts such as shells are usually found) are extremely valuable because they provide information about organisms that are hardly ever fossilized and much more information than is usually available about those for which only the hard parts are usually preserved.&lt;ref name="Briggs2003RoleInFossilization" /&gt; Microbial mats help to preserve soft-bodied fossils  by:
*Capturing corpses on the sticky surfaces of mats and thus preventing them from floating or drifting away.&lt;ref name="Briggs2003RoleInFossilization"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Briggs, D.E.G. | contribution=The role of biofilms in the fossilization of non-biomineralized tissues | pages=281–290 | title=Fossil and Recent Biofilms: A Natural History of Life on Earth | editor=Krumbein, W.E. |editor2=Paterson, D.M. |editor3=Zavarzin, G.A. | year=2003 | publisher=Kluwer Academic| isbn=1-4020-1597-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s85eD_FubN4C&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22The+role+of+biofilms+in+the+fossilization+of+non-biomineralized+tissues%22 | accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Physically protecting them from being eaten by scavengers and broken up by burrowing animals, and protecting fossil-bearing sediments from erosion. For example, the speed of water current required to erode sediment bound by a mat is 20–30 times as great as the speed required to erode a bare sediment.&lt;ref name="Briggs2003RoleInFossilization" /&gt;
*Preventing or reducing decay both by physically screening the remains from decay-causing bacteria and by creating chemical conditions that are hostile to decay-causing bacteria.&lt;ref name="Briggs2003RoleInFossilization" /&gt;
*Preserving tracks and burrows by protecting them from erosion.&lt;ref name="Briggs2003RoleInFossilization" /&gt;  Many trace fossils date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them and thus improve paleontologists' estimates of when animals with these capabilities first appeared.&lt;ref name="Seilacher1994CruzianaStratigraphy"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, A. | year = 1994 | title = How valid is Cruziana Stratigraphy? | journal = International Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 752–8 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/WP279834395100KH.pdf  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-09 | doi=10.1007/BF00251073 | bibcode=1994GeoRu..83..752S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial uses==
The ability of microbial mat communities to use a vast range of "foods" has recently led to interest in industrial uses.

Migration studies is an interdisciplinary field which draws on [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[law]], [[sociology]] and [[postcolonial studies]].

In [[epidemiology]], an "immigration study" is a method of understanding the relative importance of inherited genetics and environmental factor in medical conditions whose incidence varies around the world. It examines the incidence of conditions in populations who have moved (or whose recent ancestors have moved) between places at different rates. Often the immigrant population can be shown to have similar rates to the population of the new location, suggesting that environmental factors such as diet, obesity and exercise are the dominant determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Incidence in U.S. Immigrant Populations - Landmark Studies|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/studies/surveillance/study5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Network Resource Planning''' is an enhanced process of network planning that incorporates the disciplines of business planning, marketing, and engineering to develop integrated, dynamic master plans for all domains of communications networks.

==Next generation services==

Many [[Communications Service Provider|communications service providers]] - from [[Wireline (networking)|wireline]], [[wireless]], [[broadband]] to [[Next Generation Networking|next generation]] carriers - are introducing next-generation services such as interactive video over cell phones and multi-user conference calling.&lt;ref name="cotrupe"&gt;{{cite web| first = Jeffrey| last = Cotrupe| title = OSS/BSS Shopping List for 2007. Part 1: Network Planning – An EMA Advisory Note| url = http://www.vpisystems.com/mediafiles/EMA_Cotrupe-0207_AN.pdf| publisher = Enterprise Management Associates| pages = 6| format = PDF| date = February 2007| accessdate = 2009-09-10| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081031005037/http://www.vpisystems.com/mediafiles/EMA_Cotrupe-0207_AN.pdf| archivedate = 2008-10-31| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These new services are straining the capacity of existing networks.  In a 2006 Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1944376720061020 interview], John Roese, CTO of Nortel, pointed out that [[YouTube]] almost destroyed the Internet,&lt;ref name="dabrowski" &gt;{{cite news| first = Wojtek| last = Dabrowski| title = Video-hungry Users Could Push Net to the Brink: Nortel| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1944376720061020| publisher =Reuters| accessdate = 2006-10-20 | date=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a keynote [http://gigaom.com/2006/12/12/chambers-video-is-the-killer-app/ speech] at Cisco’s C-Scape analyst conference in December 2006, John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Networks said, “Things like YouTube are just the baby steps of the impact video will have on networks.”  Since every video transmission requires roughly 150 times the bandwidth of a voice transmission, it is estimated that a one percent adoption of the [[Verizon Wireless]] [[V CAST]] service required a 400 percent increase in Verizon’s corresponding network capacity. 

The bandwidth-intense nature of next generation services has required traditional [[Network planning and design|network planning]] to evolve.  Subscriber growth of legacy services like voice and data had an incremental impact on networks.  New subscriptions and their corresponding bandwidth demand followed a relatively linear growth curve.  As such, planning methods such as link- and node-specific [[Telecommunications forecasting|forecasting]] or “trending” were sufficient to ensure networks could support current and planned subscribers.

The dramatic swings in bandwidth demand that slight variances in subscription rates bring to bear on networks carrying services such as video can no longer be adequately planned for with these traditional methods.  Network Resource Planning addresses the weaknesses of trending by incorporating business planning and marketing insight in the planning process.  The addition of market analysis adds an additional layer of context and provides a feedback loop that enables more accurate planning. Furthermore, the importance of coordinating infrastructure investment activities across organizations is addressed to ensure that network capacity is provided when and where it is needed, and that human and [[Operations Support Systems|operational support system]] resources are appropriately included in the planning process.

==Next generation networks==

The bandwidth needs of next generation services has placed added pressure on carriers to migrate from traditional networks like [[PSTN]] and [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] to new [[Internet Protocol|Internet Protocol (IP)]]-based, or [[Next Generation Networking|next generation networks]], that can more adequately support the new services.  Planning the transition to IP-based networks is a difficult endeavor in many respects. The [[Capital expenditure|capital expenditure (CAPEX)]] challenge of these new networks is that while it is remains expensive to make a mistake and deploy too much equipment (i.e., over-building their network and wasting assets), the non-linear relationship between bandwidth and network requirements means there are also significant costs from deploying too little (i.e., under-building the network and putting themselves at a higher chance of delivering poor [[quality of service]] and losing market share).

From a technical perspective, the new IP-based networks are also far more difficult to plan.  The self-routing nature of IP networks requires planners to determine how the network will behave under normal, overloaded, and failure scenarios. The fact that IP can drop or delay packets during overload conditions introduces new complexity to the system.  Interactive services such as voice, two-way video, and gaming are particularly susceptible to the resultant digital jitter and delay.  Under these circumstances, the network planners need to know how these services will be affected under varying conditions.  In addition, they need to know how the network can be configured to provide the best quality of service at the least cost.&lt;ref name="mortensen" &gt;{{cite web| first = Mark| last = Mortensen| title = Five Big Mistakes Carriers Make When Planning a Next-Generation Network| url = http://telephonyonline.com/broadband/news/next_generation_mistakes_032107/| publisher = Telephony Online| accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is further compounded by the fact that the simplicity of IP network operations comes from a more uniform, layered approach to network architecture.  It’s the interaction between the layers of the network that creates significant complexity. For example, routine services can run on an IP (and/or Ethernet) network, while high-QoS services are assigned to special routes. These services ride on the underlying logical transport network (ring or mesh), which in turn rides on the underlying optical infrastructure.  For planning teams, the effect of traffic on each layer must be taken into account in the other layers.  This situation is made even more complex when reliability and disaster scenarios come into play, as backup resources must be made available at each layer in the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="mortensen" /&gt;

Traditionally, network planning was performed on a domain-by-domain (i.e., transport, access, etc.) and isolated basis.  Network Resource Planning has adapted to address the shared-fabric nature of IP networks by integrating planning across domains.  Network planners have a much more powerful tool in Network Resource Planning for leveraging all of the strengths of the various domains in comprehensive master plans.  Over the next five years, the vast majority of tier-1 and -2 service providers are expected to shift to convergent network planning systems to handle the complexity of these networks, as well as reduce CAPEX and operational costs.&lt;ref name="mcelligott" &gt;{{cite web| first = Tim| last = McElligott| title = VPIsystems delivers a plan for the future| url = http://telephonyonline.com/software/technology/vpisystems_oneplan_planning_112006/index.html| publisher = Telephony Online| accessdate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G.

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

An '''oil body''' is a [[lipid]]-containing structure found in plant cells. The term can refer to at least two distinct kinds of structures in different kinds of plants.

==Oil bodies in liverworts==

[[Marchantiophyta|Liverwort]] oil bodies are structures unique to liverworts that contain [[Terpenoid|isoprenoid]] [[essential oil]]s and are surrounded by a single membrane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/124/3/971.full Suire et al. Cellular Localization of Isoprenoid Biosynthetic Enzymes in ''Marchantia polymorpha''. Uncovering a New Role of Oil Bodies. Plant Physiology November 2000 vol. 124 no. 3 971-978. ] {{doi|10.1104/pp.124.3.971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size, shape, color, and number of oil bodies per cell is characteristic of certain species and may be used to identify these.

==Oil bodies in vascular plants==

Some species of [[vascular plants]] also contain intracellular structures called oil bodies. Vascular plant oil bodies consist mainly of [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerols]] surrounded by a layer consisting of [[phospholipid]]s and the protein [[oleosin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcb.rupress.org/content/117/2/327.abstract Tzen &amp; Huang. Surface structure and properties of plant seed oil bodies. Journal of Cell Biology 1992 vol. 117 no. 2 327-335 ] {{doi|10.1083/jcb.117.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oil bodies occur largely in seeds but also occur in other plant parts, including leaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amjbot.org/content/93/12/1731.full Lersten et al. Oil bodies in leaf mesophyll cells of angiosperms: overview and a selected survey. American Journal of Botany. 1 December 2006 vol. 93 no. 12 1731-1739. ] {{doi|10.3732/ajb.93.12.1731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil Bodies in Seeds==

Oil Bodies are the organelle that has evolved to hold triglycerides in plant cells.  They are therefore the principal store of chemical energy in oleagenous seeds.  The structure and composition of plant seed oil bodies has been the subject of research from at least as far back as the 1980s, with several papers published in the 80s and 90s.  Recent work, using updated techniques, has given a detailed molecular profile of oil bodies.  It now seems that proteins out-number lipids on the surface of oil bodies, and that one protein in particular, called oleosin, dominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furse S, Liddell S, Ortori CA, Williams HE, Neylon DC, Scott DJ, Barrett DA, Gray DA |title=The lipidome and proteome of oil bodies from Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) |journal=J. Chem. Biol. |volume= 6 |issue= 2 |pages= 63–76 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 23532185|pmc= 3606697|doi=10.1007/s12154-012-0090-1 |issn= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lipid and protein fractions of oil bodies are remarkable because they maintain a coherent monolayer over a wide temperature and hydration range.

'''Opower''' was a company that provided a software-as-a-service customer engagement platform for utilities. It existed as an independent corporation until its acquisition by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2016. The Opower product line are now marketed by Oracle under the Oracle Utilities moniker.

== History and growth ==
Founded in 2007 by long-time friends Dan Yates and [[Alex Laskey]], Opower is headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia. As of February 2014, it employed more than 500 people in five offices: Arlington, San Francisco, London, Singapore, and Japan.

In June 2010, [[iLike]] founder [[Hadi Partovi]] joined Opower's board to advise on its [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/opower-growth/ "Opower to Expand to West Coast, Names iLike Founder Hadi Partovi to Advisory Board,"] TechCrunch, June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Opower opened a second office in [[San Francisco]] and had Fred Butler, a former president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and commissioner of the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]], join its advisory board.

In 2013, Opower added former utility CEOs John Rowe and Dick Kelly, and former White House Director, Carol Browner, to its advisory board. Tom Brady, former chairman of BGE, was named chairman of the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elp.com/articles/2013/06/former-ceos-of-xcel--exelon-join-opower.html "Former CEOs of Xcel, Exelon Join Opower], ''Electric Light &amp; Power'', June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Opower added Marcus Ryu, CEO of Guidewire, and Deep Nishar, SVP of Products and User Experience at LinkedIn, to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allthingsd.com/20130916/opower-adds-guidewires-marcus-ryu-and-linkedins-deep-nishar-to-board/ "Opower adds Guidewire's Marcus Ryu and Linkedin's Deep Nishar to board,"]"All Things Digital", September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] announced the company as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/NR_TP2011 Thirty-One Visionary Companies Selected as Technology Pioneers 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the company announced its third round of venture capital funding, a $50 million investment led by [[Accel Partners]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], to accelerate its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113000021.html "Opower plans expansion with $50 million investment,"] ''The Washington Post'', Nov. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to Opower headquarters in Arlington in 2010, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said the company's growth is "a model of what we want to be seeing all across the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House press release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Opower was named to the Inaugural CNBC Disruptors 50 List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100637276 "CNBC Disruptor 50"] CNBC, May 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Opower was named the #1 fastest-growing tech company in the DC region, and #20 in the US, by Deloitte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/TMT_us_tmt/us_tmt_fast500_rankings_110713.pdf "Technology Fast 500 2013 Ranking"], Deloitte, November 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Dan Yates gave the keynote address at the Cleantech Group's Cleantech Forum in San Francisco in March 2014. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1378&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=p-N2&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=156690981409924149615&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=193&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A156690981409924149615%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1378%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary/"Opower CEO Dan Yates #CFSF14 Keynote - Passion, Science, Incremental Change], Vimeo, March 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower held its [[initial public offering]] on April 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2014/04/04/opower-ipo-opens-up-strong-starts-trading-at-25-per-share/ "Opower IPO: Opens up strong, starts trading at $25 per share"], Gigaom, April 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower laid off&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2016/04/11/layoffs-at-arlington-based-opower/;|title=ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. Local News|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7.5 % of its global workforce on April 8, 2016.

On May 2, 2016, Opower announced that it was being acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://opower.com/oracle/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/oracle-agrees-to-buy-arlington-energy-data-firm-opower-for-532-million/2016/05/02/83739416-107f-11e6-93ae-50921721165d_story.html|title=Oracle agrees to buy Arlington energy data firm Opower for $532 million|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/opower/index.html|title=Oracle and Opower|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and technology ==
Opower's software uses statistical [[algorithm]]s to perform [[pattern recognition]] analysis from data in order to derive information for utility customers. Without any devices installed in the home, the platform can perform usage-disaggregation analysis, presenting end users information such as heating or cooling usage apart from overall usage, and thus allowing them to spot additional opportunities to save money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/opower-separates-heat-light-in-home-energy/ "Opower Separates Heat, Light in Home Energy,"] ''Greentech Media'', December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The average customer receiving the Opower platform has cut energy usage by more than 2.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-11-09/energy-use-neighbor-vs-dot-neighbor Energy Use: Neighbor vs. Neighbor]", ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] concluded in a June 2010 ''report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceee.org/pubs/e105.htm "Advanced Metering Initiatives and Residential Feedback Programs: A Meta-Review for Household Electricity-Saving Opportunities,"] American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that customer-feedback programs, like Opower, could boost [[energy security]], help the environment and save consumers money.

Opower's Energy Reports incorporate the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]] techniques of [[Robert Cialdini]], Opower's chief scientist and the author of ''Influence'', a 1984 book on persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/21/21climatewire-finding-the-weapons-of-persuasion-to-save-ene-8137.html?pagewanted=1;title "Finding the 'Weapons' of Persuasion to Save Energy,"] ''New York Times'', June 21, 2010, originally published in ClimateWire&lt;/ref&gt; The reports include targeted tips that seek to motivate customers to lower their energy consumption to the "normal" neighborhood rate. The reports also feature [[Smiley|smiley-face emoticons]] for the most energy-efficient homes, a feature that Opower added after research showed that some consumers who used less energy than average started using more once they knew the norm. The reports also compare energy usage among neighbors with similarly sized houses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-01-homeenergy01_ST_N.htm "Do you use more energy than your neighbors?"] ''USA Today'', 1 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The company mails the reports to consumers, but also offers the information in other formats, including internet portals, [[Text messaging|text messages]], email and in-home energy displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20003852-54.html?tag=mncol;title "Opower looks to add human touch to smart grid,"] CNET, May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Opower's software enables customers to input more information to generate recommendations about specific types of energy use, such as [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/02/opowers-new-marketplace-entices-homeowners-to-become-energy-efficient/ |title= OPOWER’s New Marketplace Entices Homeowners To Become Energy Efficient | work = [[The Daily Energy Report]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President Obama's visit ==
[[Image:OPOWER-Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Barack Obama]] President [[Barack Obama]] visited Opower headquarters in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] on March 5, 2010. He touted the company as an economic "success story" amid a troubled economy and as a "great emblem" for clean energy jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He made the visit two months after announcing a "$2.3 billion program"&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/08/news/economy/green_manufacturing_jobs/index.htm "Obama unveils $2.3 billion for clean energy jobs,"] ''CNN Money'', January 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of tax credits for "[[green job]]s." "The work you do here...is making homes more energy efficient, it's saving people money, it's generating jobs, and it's putting America on the path to a clean energy future", Obama said at Opower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972936_1973104,00.html?xid=rss-specials "Can Small Lifestyle Changes Lead to Huge CO2 Cuts?,"] Time, March 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House released a video of Obama's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9AkF3IYko "Creating New Jobs in a Clean Energy Economy,"] White House YouTube channel, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paubhā''' ([[Devanagari]]: पौभा) is a traditional religious painting made by the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitrakar |first=Madan |title=Nepali Art |publisher=Teba-Chi Studies Centre |location=Kathmandu |year=2012 |pages=35–52 |chapter=Paubha Art|isbn=978-9937-2-4933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paubhas depict deities, [[mandala]]s or monuments, and are used to help the practitioner meditate. The [[Tibetan art|Tibetan]] equivalent is known as [[Thangka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, A.W. and Stahl, Anne Vergati (1979) ''Newar Art: Nepalese Art during the Malla Period.'' New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most paubhas show [[Buddhist]] subjects, but a few have [[Hindu]] themes. The paintings are made to earn religious merit both for the artist and the patron. Newar Buddhists commission artists to paint paubhas which are displayed during festivals and other special occasions. The traditional painters of paubhas are the [[Chitrakar]] caste who are known as Pun (पुं) in [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitrakar, Madan (2000) ''Tej Bahadur Chitrakar: Icon of a Transition.'' Kathmandu: Teba-Chi (TBC) Studies Centre. {{ISBN|99933-879-7-5}}. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==

A paubha of [[Amitabha Buddha]] at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] is believed to be the earliest specimen which is done in a style dating from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

 ([[Nepal Sambat]] 485). It is a specimen of the skill of Newar artists that made them sought-after throughout the Himalayan region and as far as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2011/c-welch-part-ii-l11228/overview.html| title = The Stuart Cary Welch Collection | work = | publisher = Sotheby's| year=| accessdate =24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newar artists and merchants took the paubha art to Tibet from which the Tibetan thangka evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| title =The Nepalese Legacy in Tibetan Painting| work =| publisher =Rubin Museum of Art| year =| accessdate =25 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111120102024/http://www.rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| archivedate =20 November 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==

Paubhas are painted on a rectangular piece of canvas. It is prepared by applying a mixture of buffalo glue and white clay on it. The surface is then rubbed with a smooth stone to give it polish. The painting is done according to the rules and dimensions handed down by tradition, and artists cannot exercise their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhan|first=Ujjwal |title=A heritage in peril
|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/07/09/features/a-heritage-in-peril/210299/ |date=10 July 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paint is made from minerals and plants. Gold and silver paint are also used on paubhas. The eyes of the deity are painted when the rest of the painting has been completed, and is known as "mikhā chāyekegu" (opening the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Gurung (Pradhan)| first =Renuka| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/13/paubha-painting-the-traditional-art-of-nepal.html| title =Paubha Painting: The Traditional Art of Nepal| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brocade is sewn to the edge of the paubha to make a frame for display.

From a composition perspective, the surface of Paubha is usually occupied of a large figure in the center that is placed inside a shrine and surrounded by registers of smaller figures on the sides; the background is usually filled in with natural elements such as rocks rendered in abstract patterns. The color is often deep and subdued with subtle shadings of the figures and exquisite renderings of details that are the hallmarks of early Nepalese paubhas&lt;ref&gt;Huu Phuoc Le, Le Huu Phuoc, '''Buddhist Architecture '''', Grafikol, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

An annual exhibition of statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] and paubhas is held in sacred courtyards in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु), and is held during the month of [[Gunla]]. Gunla, which corresponds to August, is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Groups of devotees led by musical bands make a tour of the courtyards to view the displays. In recent times, the traditional exhibitions have become fewer and shorter due to fear of art thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapted from Patten and Kelly (2010)&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;]]
A '''perceptual trap''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] scenario in which [[environmental change]], typically [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], leads an organism to avoid an otherwise high-quality [[habitat]]. The concept is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.

==History==
In a 2004 article discussing [[source-sink dynamics]], James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both "sources."&lt;ref name=Battin&gt;Battin, J. (2004) [http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf "When good animals love bad habitats: ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813074823/http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (PDF), ''Conservation Biology,'' '''18''': 1482–1491&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenonmenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland,&lt;ref name=Gilroy&gt;Gilroy, J. J., and W. J. Sutherland. (2007) "Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources," ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution,'' '''22''': 351–356&lt;/ref&gt; who described them as "undervalued resources." The term "perceptual trap" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article.&lt;ref name=Patten&gt;Patten, M.A., and Kelly, J.F. (2010) "Habitat selection and the perceptual trap," ''Ecological Applications,'' '''20''': 2148–2156.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Van Dyck&lt;ref name=VanDyck&gt;Van Dyck, H. (2012) "Changing organisms in rapidly changing anthropogenic landscapes: the significance of the ‘Umwelt’-concept and functional habitat for animal conservation," ''Evolutionary Applications,'' '''5(2)''': : 144–153.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping.

==Description==
Animals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat.&lt;ref name=Kristan&gt;Kristan, W. B. (2003) "The role of habitat selection behavior in population dynamics: source–sink systems and ecological
traps," ''Oikos,'' '''103''': 457–468&lt;/ref&gt; A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; There is expected to be strong [[natural selection]] against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as [[Allee effect]]s may restrict a population’s ability to establish itself.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Lesser Prairie Chicken.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; propose that a perceptual trap is acting on populations of the [[lesser prairie chicken]]]]
To support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; cited a study of the [[lesser prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus pallidicinctus''). The species' natural environment, [[shinnery oak]] [[grassland]], is often treated with the [[herbicide]] [[tebuthiuron]] to increase grass cover for [[grazing|cattle grazing]].&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in  herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and [[clutch size]]s to those in untreated areas.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the [[spotted towhee]] (''Pipilo maculatus'') and [[rufous-crowned sparrow]] (''Aimophila ruficeps''), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in [[snake]] predation.&lt;ref name=Patten2&gt;Patten, M. A., and D. T. Bolger (2003) "Variation in top-down control of avian reproductive success across a fragmentation gradient", ''Oikos,'' '''101''':479–488&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The existence of phantom energy could cause the expansion of the universe to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]] so quickly that a scenario known as the [[Big Rip]], a possible [[ultimate fate of the universe|end to the universe]], occurs.

The [[expansion of the universe]] reaches an infinite degree in finite time, causing expansion to accelerate without bounds.  This acceleration necessarily passes the speed of light (since it involves expansion of the universe itself, not particles moving within it), causing more and more objects to leave our [[observable universe]] faster than its expansion, as light and information emitted from distant stars and other cosmic sources cannot "catch up" with the expansion.  As the observable universe expands, objects will be unable to interact with each other via fundamental forces, and eventually the expansion will prevent any action of forces between any particles, even within atoms, "ripping apart" the universe.

One application of phantom energy in 2007 was to a [[cyclic model]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lauris Baum and [[Paul Frampton]]|

'''Random coil index (RCI)'''  predicts [[protein]] flexibility by calculating an inverse weighted average of backbone secondary [[chemical shift]]s and predicting values of model-free order parameters as well as per-residue RMSD of NMR and [[molecular dynamics]] ensembles from this parameter.&lt;ref name=RCI_JACS_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|year=2005|volume=127 | issue = 43 |pages=14970–14971|doi=10.1021/ja054842f| url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja054842f |pmid=16248604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key advantages of this protocol over existing methods of studying protein flexibility are
# it does not require prior knowledge of a [[protein]]'s tertiary structure,
# it is not sensitive to the protein's overall tumbling and
# it does not require additional NMR measurements beyond the standard experiments for backbone assignments.&lt;ref name=RCI_JBNMR_2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=Application of the random coil index to studying protein flexibility|journal=Journal of Biomolecular NMR|year=2008|volume=40|issue=1|pages=31–48|doi=10.1007/s10858-007-9208-0|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2966482w10306126/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of secondary chemical shifts to characterize protein flexibility is based on an assumption that the proximity of chemical shifts to random coil values is a manifestation of increased protein mobility, while significant differences from random coil values are an indication of a relatively rigid structure.&lt;ref name="RCI_JACS_2005"/&gt;

Even though chemical shifts of rigid residues may adopt random coil values as a result of comparable contributions of shielding and deshielding effects (e.g. from torsion angles, hydrogen bonds, ring currents, etc.), combining the chemical shifts from multiple nuclei into a single parameter allows one to decrease the influence of these flexibility false positives. The improved performance originates from the different probabilities of random coil chemical shifts from different nuclei being found among amino acid residues in flexible regions versus rigid regions. Typically, residues in rigid helices or rigid beta-strands are less likely to have more than one random coil chemical shift among their backbone shifts than residues in mobile regions.&lt;ref name="RCI_JBNMR_2008"/&gt;

The actual calculation of the RCI involves several additional steps including the smoothing of secondary shifts over several adjacent residues, the use of neighboring residue corrections, [[Protein Chemical Shift Re-Referencing|chemical shift re-referencing]], gap filling, chemical shift scaling and numeric adjustments to prevent [[Division by zero|divide-by-zero]] problems. 13C, 15 N and 1H secondary chemical shifts are then scaled to account for the characteristic resonance frequencies of these nuclei and to provide numeric consistency among different parts of the protocol. Once these scaling corrections have been done, the RCI is calculated. The ‘‘end-effect correction’’ can also be applied at this point. The last step of the protocol involves smoothing the initial set of RCI values by three-point averaging.&lt;ref name=RCI_Nature_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Berjanskii|author2=David Wishart |title=NMR: prediction of protein flexibility|journal=Nature Protocols|year=2006|volume=1|pages=683–688|doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.108| url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v1/n2/full/nprot.2006.108.html|issue=2|pmid=17406296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Remote Sensing Center''' (RSC) at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] was established to bring together a range of capabilities and expertise to address problems of military and intelligence importance, as well as environmental and civil concerns.  It is specialized in a variety of [[remote sensing]] technologies designed to enable people to look beyond the range of human vision in range or in spectral perception.

== Mission ==

Members of the RSC come from the [[physics]], electrical and computer engineering, computer science, [[meteorology]], and [[oceanography]] departments.  They are collaborating to develop new remote sensing systems, as well as use and exploit current systems in air and space.  It is part of a larger activity in the [[Monterey Bay]] area that provides expertise in topical areas outside the technical disciplines available at NPS.

The Naval Postgraduate School, and specifically the Remote Sensing Center, has the ability to handle classified data, as well as access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) that is fully equipped with comms, storage, and processing capabilities.  The RSC has pre-established cooperative research with government, academia, and industry in the remote sensing sector ranging from local to international partners.  Highly experienced military officers, intelligence analysts, and faculty are a critical part of the NPS research staff.

==Projects==

=== Lidar ===
''[[Lidar]]'' (LIght raDAR) works as an optical analog to [[radar]] in the visible spectrum of light with advantages related to the smaller wavelengths of the laser pulse.  Lidar ranges in wavelength from ultra-violet (0.3-0.45&amp;nbsp;µm) to visible (0.45-0.70&amp;nbsp;µm) to the infrared (1-15&amp;nbsp;µm).  Lidar can detect much smaller particles than radar in the atmosphere (which cannot detect things smaller than cloud particles), and thus can be used for aerosol detection.

The raw form of data is a set of x,y,z coordinate points.  With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically.  Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features.  Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar.  Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, [[ERDAS IMAGINE]], [[ArcInfo]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.)  One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]). DEMs are displayed in a raster format with a matrix.  The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth’s surfaces.  The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it. 

The Remote Sensing Center is planning research projects that undertake the modeling and testing of analytical processing and using more fieldwork to obtain ground-truth measurements.  Projects have been completed and are currently underway in terrain classification including [[Elkhorn Slough]] and hidden trail identification.  Other future projects include a collaboration with the MOdeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) institute on lidar standards for data structure and visualization tools and modeling new lidar analysis tools.

=== Spectral Imagery Analysis ===

Spectral imagery measures the spectral character of materials within the visible range and beyond.  Two objects may appear visually identical but may be distinguished through examination of their spectral properties.  Computer software can use a color scheme to make them visible.

A subset of spectral imagery, [[hyperspectral imaging]] data, is produced when "solar electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth's surface is dispersed into many contiguous narrow spectral bands by an airborne spectrometer" (Stefanou, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2). Our current research and projects include environmental mapping, target detection, and change detection.

The Remote Sensing Center works with airborne and satellite systems including [[IKONOS]]/[[Quickbird]] [[multispectral imagery]] (MSI), and airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems including [[AVIRIS]], HYDICE, CASI, and HYMAP.  Classification and analysis, including atmospheric compensation is performed using standard industry research tools; notably ENVI and ERDAS Imagine.  The RSC has acquired a [[polarimetry|polarimetric]] camera for expanding experimentation in the visible spectrum.

==Intelligence==
The Remote Sensing Center benefits from the secure facilities at NPS.  Having the ability to process classified data with an on-site, fully equipped Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) allows students and faculty to pursue lines of research and work with technologies unavailable to the public.

The sustained efforts of fully funded graduate students, both military and civilian with an average of eight to ten years of field experience, have conducted research in an array of topics related to remote sensing.

*Current projects include:
:Helicopter Brownout (terrain classification) using National Technical Means (NTM)
:Maritime Domain Awareness (ASW)
:Snow/Ice study with UCSB using NTM

==Degree Programs==
The Remote Sensing Research and Education Program (RS-REP) is an interdisciplinary program to promote Remote Sensing technical education and research advancement to ensure that the Intelligence Community is fully supported for technology evolution.  The curriculum is in hiatus as of 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of "Mission Survivability" whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the "survivability" of a platform through a complete mission, or the "survivability" of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of "Force Survivability" which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain "mission capable".

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of "crew survivability" is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment:

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

'''Tacet''' is [[Latin]] which translates literally into English as "(it) is silent" (pronounced: {{IPA|/ˈte.sət/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtæ.sət/}}; or {{IPA|/ˈtɑ.ˌkɛt/}}).&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Tacet|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a musical term to indicate that an instrument or voice does not sound, also known as a [[rest (music)|rest]]. In vocal polyphony and in orchestral scores, it usually indicates a long period of time, typically an entire [[Movement (music)|movement]]. In more modern music such as [[jazz]], tacet tends to mark considerably shorter breaks. '''Multirests''', or multiple-measure rests, are rests which last multiple [[bar (music)|measures]] (or multiple rests, each of which lasts an entire measure).

{{Quote|Tacet. (Lat.) A word by which the performer is to understand that the instrument with the name of which it is conjoined is to be silent: a ''Violino Tacet''; the violin is not to play: ''Oboe Tacet''; the oboe is silent.|[[Thomas Busby (composer)|Thomas Busby]] (1827)&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Thomas (1827). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJFRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT272&amp;dq=tacet+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOyujejZ_WAhVRyWMKHf0mAfYQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=tacet%20music&amp;f=false Complete Dictionary of Music]'', p.z2. Snider. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was common for early [[Symphony|symphonies]] to leave out the [[brass instrument|brass]] or [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] in certain movements, especially in slow (second) movements, and this is the instruction given in the parts for the player to wait until the end of the movement.

[[File:Old multirests.png|thumb|How multirests used to be notated (see [[longa (music)|longa]], [[double whole note|breve]], and [[semibreve]])]]
[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|How multirests are now notated, known as the H-bar (which may be narrow, leaving room for things such as an [[anacrusis]] to be written in)]]

It is also commonly used in [[accompaniment]] music to indicate that the instrument does not play on a certain run through a portion of the music, i.e., "Tacet 1st time." The phrase ''tacet al fine'' is used to indicate that the performer should remain silent for the remainder of the piece (or portion thereof), and need not, for example, count rests.

Tacet may be appropriate when a particular instrument/voice/section, "is to rest for an entire section, movement, or composition."&lt;ref&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.126. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Partial rests, of course, in every case must be written in. Even though it means 'silent,' the term ''tacet''...is not a wise substitution for a lengthy rest within a movement...The term ''tacet'', therefore, should be used ''only'' to indicate that a player rests throughout an ''entire movement''. In printed music this would be indicated:"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1969/1979). ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', p.435-7. 2nd edition.

==Uses of tacet==
The earliest known usage of the term is 1724.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

A unique usage of this term is in [[John Cage|John Cage's]] 1952 composition [[4′33″]].  A tacet is indicated for all three movements, for all instruments.  The piece lasts a total of 4 minutes and 33 seconds, without a note being played.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2583">'''Telluric contamination''' is [[systematic error|contamination]] of the [[Astronomical spectroscopy|astronomical spectra]] by the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

==Interference with astronomical observations==
Most astronomical observations are conducted by measuring [[photon]]s ([[electromagnetic waves]]) which originate beyond the sky.  The molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, however, [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emit]] their own light, especially in the visible and [[infrared|near-IR]] portion of the [[spectrum]], and any ground-based observation is subject to contamination from these telluric (earth-originating) sources.  Water vapor, oxygen, and OH are some of the more important molecules in telluric contamination.  Water contamination was particularly pronounced in the Mount Wilson solar Doppler measurements.

Many scientific telescopes have [[spectrograph]]s, which measure photons as a function of [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]], with typical resolution on the order of a [[nanometer]].  [[Spectroscopic]] observations can be used in myriad contexts, including measuring the chemical composition and physical properties of astronomical objects as well as measuring object velocities from the Doppler shift of spectral lines.  Unless they are corrected for, telluric contamination can produce errors or reduce precision in such data.

Telluric contamination can also be important for [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements.

==Telluric correction==
It is possible to correct for the effects of telluric contamination in an astronomical [[spectrum]]. This is done by preparing a telluric correction [[Function (mathematics)|function]], made by dividing a [[model spectrum]] of a star by an observation of an astronomical [[photometric standard stars|photometric standard star]]. This function can then be multiplied by an astronomical observation at each [[wavelength]] point.

While this method can restore the original shape of the [[spectrum]], the regions affected can be prone to high levels of [[noise]] due to the low number of counts in that area of the spectrum.

Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and are effectively just larger forms of these.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Robert J, et al. (2007). ''Biology (First Edition)'', (McGraw-Hill, New York), p. 79 {{ISBN|0-07-326807-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell.

==Overview==
The function and significance of vacuoles varies greatly according to the type of cell in which they are present, having much greater prominence in the cells of plants, fungi and certain protists than those of animals and bacteria. In general, the functions of the vacuole include:

*Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell
*Containing waste products
*Containing water in plant cells
*Maintaining internal [[hydrostatic pressure]] or [[turgor]] within the cell
*Maintaining an [[acid]]ic internal [[pH]]
*Containing small molecules
*Exporting unwanted substances from the cell
*Allows plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers due to the pressure of the central vacuole
*By increasing in size, allows the germinating plant or its organs (such as leaves) to grow very quickly and using up mostly just water.&lt;ref&gt;http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/1/151.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*In seeds, stored proteins needed for germination are kept in 'protein bodies', which are modified vacuoles.&lt;ref&gt;Matile, Phillipe (1993) '' Chapter 18: Vacuoles, discovery of lysosomal origin'' in ''Discoveries in Plant Biology: v. 1'' (World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuoles also play a major role in [[autophagy]], maintaining a balance between [[biogenesis]] (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the [[lysis]] and recycling of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell. Thomas Boller&lt;ref&gt;[http://plantbiology.unibas.ch/people/boller/boller.htm Thomas Boller]. Plantbiology.unibas.ch. Retrieved on 2011-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and others proposed that the vacuole participates in the destruction of invading [[bacteria]] and [[Robert B. Mellor]] proposed organ-specific forms have a role in 'housing' symbiotic bacteria. In protists,&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[Food vacuole | food vacuole in ''Plasmodium'']].&lt;/ref&gt; vacuoles have the additional function of storing food which has been absorbed by the organism and assisting in the digestive and waste management process for the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jezbera Jan |author2=Karel Hornak |author3=Karel Simek |title=Food selection by bacterivorous protists: insight from the analysis of the food vacuole by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization |journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology |volume=52 |pages=351–363 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.femsec.2004.12.001 |pmid= 16329920 |issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vacuole probably evolved several times independently, even within the [[Viridiplantae]].&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite journal |author=Becker B |title=Function and evolution of the vacuolar compartment in green algae and land plants (Viridiplantae) |journal=International Review of Cytology |volume=264 |pages=1–24 |year=2007 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084817/http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/botanik/bot1/AGBecker/Publikationen/pdfs/IRC2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(07)64001-7 |pmid=17964920|series=International Review of Cytology |isbn=9780123742636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[Contractile vacuole]]s ("stars") were first observed by [[Spallanzani]] (1776) in [[protozoa]], although mistaken for respiratory organs. [[Félix Dujardin|Dujardin]] (1841) named these "stars" as ''vacuoles''. In 1842, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] applied the term for plant cells, to distinguish the structure with cell sap from the rest of the [[protoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Spallanzani, L. [1776]. 1920. ''Observations et expériences faites sur
les Animalicules des Infusions''. L’ École Polytechnique, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dujardin, F. 1841. ''Histoire naturelle des zoophytes: Infusoires''. Librairie Encyclopédique de Roret, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schleiden, M. J. 1842. ''Grundzüge der wissenschaftlichen Botanik''. W. Engelmann, Leipzig&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, R. 2009. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_biw80LgjwC Plant Cell Biology: From Astronomy to Zoology]''. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, [[Hugo de Vries|de Vries]] named the vacuoule membrane as tonoplast.&lt;ref&gt;de Vries, H. 1885. Plasmolytische Studien über die Wand der Vakuolen. ''Jahrb. wiss. Bot.'' 16, 465–598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacteria==
Large vacuoles are found in three [[genera]] of filamentous [[Green sulfur bacteria|sulfur bacteria]], the ''[[Thioploca]]'', ''[[Beggiatoa]]'' and ''[[Thiomargarita]]''. The cytosol is extremely reduced in these genera and the vacuole can occupy between 40–98% of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalanetra KM, Huston SL, Nelson DC |title=Novel, attached, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria at shallow hydrothermal vents possess vacuoles not involved in respiratory nitrate accumulation |journal=Appl.

[[Gas vesicle|Gas vacuoles]], which are freely permeable to gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walsby AE |title=The Permeability of Blue-Green Algal Gas-Vacuole Membranes to Gas |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy.

==Plants==
[[File:Rhoeo Discolor - Plasmolysis.jpg|thumb|The [[anthocyanin]]-storing vacuoles of ''Rhoeo spathacea'', a [[spiderwort]], in cells that have plasmolyzed]]
Most mature [[plant cell]]s have one large vacuole that typically occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume, and that can occupy as much as 80% of the volume for certain cell types and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts, Bruce, Johnson, Alexander, Lewis, Julian, Raff, Martin, Roberts, Keith, and Walter, Peter (2008). ''Molecular Biology of the Cell (Fifth Edition)'', (Garland Science, New York), p. 781 {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4111-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Strands of [[cytoplasm]] often run through the vacuole.

A vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the '''tonoplast''' (word origin: Gk tón(os) + -o-, meaning “stretching”, “tension”, “tone” + comb. form repr. Gk plastós formed, molded) and filled with '''cell sap'''. Also called the '''vacuolar membrane''', the tonoplast is the cytoplasmic membrane surrounding a vacuole, separating the vacuolar contents from the cell's cytoplasm. As a membrane, it is mainly involved in regulating the movements of ions around the cell, and isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=WING-YEN |author2=FUK-LING WONG |author3=SAU-NA TSAI |author4=TSUI-HUNG PHANG |author5=GUIHUA SHAO |author6=HON-MING LAM|title=Tonoplast-located GmCLC1 and GmNHX1 from soybean enhance NaCl tolerance in transgenic bright yellow (BY)-2 cells|journal=Plant, Cell and Environment|date=June 2006|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1122–1137|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01487.x|pmid=17080938|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01487.x/full|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport of [[proton]]s from the cytosol to the vacuole stabilizes cytoplasmic [[pH]], while making the vacuolar interior more acidic creating a [[proton motive force]] which the cell can use to transport nutrients into or out of the vacuole. The low pH of the vacuole also allows [[degradative enzyme]]s to act. Although single large vacuoles are most common, the size and number of vacuoles may vary in different tissues and stages of development. For example, developing cells in the [[meristems]] contain small provacuoles and cells of the [[vascular cambium]] have many small vacuoles in the winter and one large one in the summer.

Aside from storage, the main role of the central vacuole is to maintain [[turgor]] pressure against the [[cell wall]]. Proteins found in the tonoplast ([[aquaporins]]) control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole through [[active transport]], pumping [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[ion]]s into and out of the vacuolar interior. Due to [[osmosis]], water will diffuse into the vacuole, placing pressure on the cell wall. If water loss leads to a significant decline in turgor pressure, the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] will [[plasmolysis|plasmolyze]]. Turgor pressure exerted by vacuoles is also required for cellular elongation: as the cell wall is partially degraded by the action of [[expansin]]s, the less rigid wall is expanded by the pressure coming from within the vacuole. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is also essential in supporting plants in an upright position. Another function of a central vacuole is that it pushes all contents of the cell's cytoplasm against the cellular membrane, and thus keeps the [[chloroplasts]] closer to light.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Taiz and Eduardo Zeiger ''Plant Physiology'' 3rd Edition SINAUER 2002 p.13 and 14 {{ISBN|0-87893-856-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most plants store chemicals in the vacuole that react with chemicals in the cytosol. If the cell is broken, for example by a [[herbivore]], then the two chemicals can react forming toxic chemicals. In garlic, [[alliin]] and the enzyme [[alliinase]] are normally separated but form [[allicin]] if the vacuole is broken. A similar reaction is responsible for the production of [[syn-propanethial-S-oxide]] when [[onion]]s are cut.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Fungi==
Vacuoles in fungal cells perform similar functions to those in plants and there can be more than one vacuole per cell. In [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] cells the vacuole is a [[wikt:dynamic|dynamic]] structure that can rapidly modify its [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. They are involved in many processes including the [[homeostasis]] of cell pH and the concentration of ions, [[osmoregulation]], storing [[amino acids]] and [[polyphosphate]] and degradative processes. Toxic ions, such as [[strontium]] ({{chem|Sr|2+}}), [[cobalt]](II) ({{chem|Co|2+}}), and [[lead]](II) ({{chem|Pb|2+}}) are transported into the vacuole to isolate them from the rest of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2215422 |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |year=1990 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=266–292 |title=The fungal vacuole: composition, function, and biogenesis|author1=D J Klionsky |author2=P K Herman |author3=S D Emr  |last-author-amp=yes |pmc=372777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==

In animal cells, vacuoles perform mostly subordinate roles, assisting in larger processes of [[exocytosis]] and [[endocytosis]].

Animal vacuoles are smaller than their plant counterparts but also usually greater in number.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; There are also animal cells that do not have any vacuoles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology-online.org/11/1_plant_cells_vs_animal_cells.htm Plant cells vs. Animal cells]. Biology-Online.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Exocytosis is the extrusion process of proteins and lipids from the cell. These materials are absorbed into secretory granules within the [[Golgi apparatus]] before being transported to the cell membrane and secreted into the extracellular environment. In this capacity, vacuoles are simply storage vesicles which allow for the containment, transport and disposal of selected proteins and lipids to the extracellular environment of the cell.

Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis and can occur in a variety of forms. [[Phagocytosis]] ("cell eating") is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of material visible under the microscope are engulfed by cells. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginates. The [[invagination]] is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane-enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. [[Pinocytosis]] ("cell drinking") is essentially the same process, the difference being that the substances ingested are in solution and not visible under the microscope.&lt;ref name=Ganong2003&gt;{{cite book|author = William F. Ganong, MD|title = Review of medical physiology|edition=21st| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phagocytosis and pinocytosis are both undertaken in association with [[lysosomes]] which complete the breakdown of the material which has been engulfed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Reggiori F |title=Membrane Origin for Autophagy |journal=Current Topics in Developmental Biology |volume=74 |pages=1–30 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0070-2153(06)74001-7 |pmid= 16860663|series=Current Topics in Developmental Biology |isbn=9780121531744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Salmonella]]'' is able to survive and reproduce in the vacuoles of several [[mammal]] species after being engulfed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leigh A. Knodler |author2=Olivia Steele-Mortimer |title= Taking Possession: Biogenesis of the Salmonella-Containing Vacuole|journal= Traffic|volume=4 |issue=9|year=2003 |pages =587–599 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0854.2003.00118.x|pmid=12911813}}

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in computing''' have shaped the evolution of [[information technology]]. They were among the first programmers in the early-20th century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.

Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]]'s prediction of [[Halley's Comet]], and [[Maria Mitchell]]'s computation of the motion of [[Venus]]. The first [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by a computer was designed by [[Ada Lovelace]] who was a pioneer in the field. [[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to design a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]]. Throughout the 19th and early-20th century, and up to [[World War II]], programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the [[Harvard Computers]], codebreaking at [[Bletchley Park]] and engineering at [[NASA]].

After the 1960s, the "soft work" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern [[software]], and the importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as [[Meg Whitman]], president and chief executive officer of [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], and [[Marissa Mayer]], president and CEO of [[Yahoo!]] and key spokesperson at [[Google]].

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of women in computing}}

=== 1700s ===
[[Nicole-Reine Lepaute|Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute]] was one of a team of [[Human computer|human computers]] who worked with [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis-Claude Clairaut]] and [[Jérôme Lalande|Joseph-Jérôme Le Français de Lalande]] to predict the date of the return of [[Halley's Comet]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=16}} They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=20-21}} Their methods were followed by successive human computers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=25}} They divided large calculations into "independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into a final product" and then checked for errors.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=25}} Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, working for the [[Connaissance des Temps|''Connaissance de Temps'']] and publishing predictions of [[Solar eclipse|solar eclipses]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=24}}

=== 1800s ===
[[File:Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering's_Harvard_computers.jpg|thumb|left|Astronomer Edward Charles Pickering's [[Harvard Computers|Harvard computers]]]]
One of the first computers for the American ''[[Nautical almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'' was [[Maria Mitchell|Maria Mitchel]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=61}} Her work on the assignment was to compute the motion of the planet [[Venus]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=62}} The ''Almanac'' never became a reality, but Mitchell became the first [[astronomy]] professor at [[Vassar College|Vassar]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=71}}

[[Ada Lovelace]] was the first person to publish an [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the [[Analytical Engine]] created by [[Charles Babbage]]. As a result she is often regarded as the first computer [[programmer]].&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing"&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.|last=Fuegi|first2=J.|last2=Francis|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4 |date=2003|pages=16–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips|first=Ana Lena|title=Crowdsourcing gender equity: Ada Lovelace Day, and its companion website, aims to raise the profile of women in science and technology|journal=American Scientist|date=November–December 2011|volume=99|issue=6|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelace Google"&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 10, 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace was introduced to Babbage's [[difference engine]] when she was 17.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=16}} In 1840, she wrote to Babbage and asked if she could become involved with his first machine.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=17}} By this time, Babbage had moved on to his idea for the Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=18}} A paper describing the Analytical Engine, ''Notions sur la machine analytique'', published by L.F. Menabrea, came to the attention of Lovelace, who not only translated it into English, but corrected mistakes made by Menabrea.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19}} Babbage suggested that she expand the translation of the paper with her own ideas, which, signed only with her initials, AAL, "synthesized the vast scope of Babbage's vision."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19-20}} Lovelace imagined the kind of impact of the Analytical Engine might have on society.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=20}} She drew up explanations of how the engine could handle inputs, outputs, processing and data storage.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She also created several [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would handle calculations of [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]] on its own.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} The proofs are considered the first examples of a computer program.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}}&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing" /&gt; Lovelace downplayed her role in her work during her life, for example, in signing her contributions with AAL so as not be "accused of bragging."{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=5}}

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States, more women were hired as human computers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Many were war widows looking for ways to support themselves.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Others were hired when the government opened positions to women because of a shortage of men to fill the roles.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}}

[[File:Annie Jump Cannon sitting at desk.jpg|thumb|[[Annie Jump Cannon]] working at Harvard]]
[[Anna Winlock]] asked to become a computer for the Harvard Observatory in 1875 and was hired to work for 25 cents an hour.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} By 1880, [[Edward Charles Pickering]] had hired several women to work for him at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] because he felt that women could do the job as well as men and he could ask them to volunteer or work for less pay.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=13}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} The women, described as "Pickering's harem" and also as the [[Harvard Computers]], performed clerical work that the male employees and scholars considered to be tedious at a fraction of the cost of hiring a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-female-computers-mapped-the-universe-and-brought-america-to-the-moon|title=How Female Computers Mapped the Universe and Brought America to the Moon|date=March 4, 2016|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=September 29, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women working for Pickering cataloged around ten thousand stars, discovered the [[Horsehead Nebula]] and developed the system to describe stars.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} One of the "computers," [[Annie Jump Cannon]], could classify stars at a rate of three stars per minute.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} The work for Pickering became so popular that women volunteered to work for free even when the computers were being paid.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=105}} Even though they performed an important role, the Harvard Computers were paid less than [[factory]] workers.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}}

By the 1890s, women computers were college graduates looking for jobs where they could use their training in a useful way.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=103}} Florence Tebb Weldon, was part of this group and provided computations relating to biology and evidence for [[evolution]], working with her husband, W.F. Raphael Weldon.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=106}} Florence Weldon's calculations demonstrated that statistics could be used to support [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of evolution.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=107}} Another human computer involved in biology was [[Alice Lee (mathematician)|Alice Lee]], who worked with [[Karl Pearson]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=110}} Pearson hired two sisters to work as part-time computers at his Biometrics Lab, [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave|Beatrice]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave|Frances Cave-Brown-Cave]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=112}}

=== 1910s ===
During [[World War I]], Karl Pearson and his Biometrics Lab helped produce [[ballistics]] calculations for the British [[Minister of Munitions|Ministry of Munitions]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} Beatrice Cave-Brown-Cave helped calculate trajectories for bomb shells.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} In 1916, Cave-Brown-Cave left Pearson's employ and started working full-time for the Ministry.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=131}} In the United States, women computers were hired to calculate ballistics in 1918, working in a building on the [[Washington Mall]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=138}} One of the women, Elizabeth Webb Wilson, worked as the chief computer.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=139}} After the war, women who worked as ballistics computers for the U.S. government had trouble finding jobs in computing and Wilson eventually taught high school math.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=152}}

=== 1920s ===
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14570000517).jpg|thumb|upright|A group of operators working on an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] telephone switchboard]]
In the early 1920s, [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]], professor [[George W. Snedecor|George Snedecor]] worked to improve the school's science and engineering departments, experimenting with new punch-card machines and calculators.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=165-166}} Snedecor also worked with human calculators most of them women, including Mary Clem.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} Clem coined the term "zero check" to help identify errors in calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} The computing lab, run by Clem, became one of the most powerful computing facilities of the time.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=169}} 

Women computers also worked at the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph]] company.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} These human computers worked with [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] to help figure out how to boost signals with [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} One of the computers, Clara Froelich, was eventually moved along with the other computers to their own division where they worked with a mathematician, Thornton Fry, to create new computational methods.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} Froelich studied IBM [[Tabulating machine|tabulating equipment]] and desk calculating machines to see if she could adapt the machine method to calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170-171}}

[[Edith Clarke]] was the first woman to earn a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and who worked as the first professionally employed electrical engineer in the United States.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|title=Mother Of Invention: This Barrier-Busting Electrical Engineer Joined Edison, Tesla in National Inventors Hall of Fame – GE Reports|last=Kellner|first=Tomas|date=2017-02-10|work=GE Reports|access-date=2018-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185215/https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|archive-date=25 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hired by [[General Electric]] as a full engineer in 1923.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Clarke also filed a patent in 1921 for a [[graphical calculator]] to be used in solving problems in power lines.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|title=Pioneering Women in Computer Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ada Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326031002/https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|archive-date=26 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was granted in 1925.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== 1930s ===
The [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) which became [[NASA]] hired a group of five women in 1935 to work as a computer pool.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/larc/from-computers-to-leaders-women-at-nasa-langley|title=From Computers to Leaders: Women at NASA Langley|last=Atkinson|first=Joe|date=August 24, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women worked on the data coming from [[wind tunnel]] and flight tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1940s ===
[[File:'bombe'.jpg|alt=Woman working on a Bombe computing device.|thumb|left|Woman working on a [[Bombe]] computing device.]]
"Tedious" computing and calculating was seen as "women's work" through the 1940s{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=21}} resulting in the term "kilogirl", invented by a member of the [[Applied Mathematics Panel]] in the early 1940s.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} A kilogirl of energy was "equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labor."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} While women's contributions to the United States war effort during [[World War II]] was championed in the media, their roles and the work they did was minimized.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} This included minimizing the complexity, skill and knowledge needed to work on computers or work as human computers.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} During WWII, women did most of the ballistics computing, seen by male engineers as being below their level of expertise.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=460}}  [[Black women]] computers worked as hard (or more often, twice as hard) as their white counterparts, but in segregated situations.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=47-48}} By 1943, almost all people employed as computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}}

NACA expanded its a pool of women human computers in the 1940s.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} NACA recognized in 1942 that "the engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1943 two groups, segregated by race, worked on the east and west side of [[Langley Air Force Base]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} The black women were the [[West Area Computers]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} Unlike their white counterparts, the black women were asked by NACA to re-do college courses they had already passed and many never received promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24429/hidden-figures-real-story-nasa-women-computers/|title=The True Story of 'Hidden Figures' and the Women Who Crunched the Numbers for NASA|last=Blitz|first=Matt|date=February 3, 2017|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also working on ballistic missile calculations. In 1948, women such as [[Barbara Paulson]] were working on the [[WAC Corporal]], determining trajectories the missiles would take after launch.{{Sfn|Holt|2016|p=58-59}}

Women worked with [[cryptography]] and, after some initial resistance, many operated and worked on the [[Bombe]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Aylard]] operated the Bombe machine testing different methods to break the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park|title=Meet the female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=July 24, 2018|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Clarke]] was a cryptographer who worked with her friend, [[Alan Turing]], on the Enigma machine at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653|title=The woman who cracked Enigma cyphers|last=Miller|first=Joe|date=November 10, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was promoted to a higher salary grade, there were no positions in the civil service for a "senior female cryptanalyst," and she was listed as a linguist instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/members/achievements/women-code-breakers-forgotten-by-history|title=Women Code Breakers: Forgotten by History|last=Pretz|first=Kathy|date=February 5, 2015|website=The Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Clarke developed a method of increasing the speed of double-encrypted messages, unlike many of the men, her decryption technique was not named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/joan-clarke-one-of-the-forgotten-women-of-bletchley|title=Joan Clarke, one of the forgotten women of Bletchley|last=Condie|first=Bill|date=May 14, 2015|website=Cosmos|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cryptographers at Bletchley included [[Margaret Rock]], [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]] (later Batey), Ruth Briggs and Kerry Howard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1941, Batey's work enabled the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to break the Italian's naval code before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-23/alan-turing-may-have-cracked-nazi-codes-thousands-women-helped|title=Alan Turing may have cracked Nazi codes, but thousands of women helped|last=Porzucki|first=Nina|date=December 23, 2014|work=Public Radio International|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, several faster Bombe machines were created.{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=270-271}} Women, like Louise Pearsall, were recruited from the [[WAVES]] to work on code breaking and operate the American Bombe machines.{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=271-272}}

[[Hedy Lamarr]] and co-inventor, [[George Antheil|George Anthei]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, worked on a [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|frequency hopping]] method to help the Navy control torpedoes remotely.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Navy passed on their idea, but Lamarr and Antheil received a patent for the work on August 11, 1942.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This technique would later be used again, first in the 1950s at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division and is used in everyday technology such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The programmers of the [[ENIAC]] computer in 1944, were six female mathematicians; [[Marlyn Meltzer]], [[Betty Holberton]], [[Kathleen Antonelli]], [[Ruth Teitelbaum]], [[Jean Bartik]], and [[Frances Spence]] who were human computers at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering|Moore School's]] computation lab.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}} [[Adele Goldstine]] was their teacher and trainer and they were known as the "ENIAC girls."{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}} The women who worked on ENIAC were warned that they would not be promoted into professional ratings which were only for men.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} Designing the hardware was "men's work" and programming the software was "women's work."{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=469}}  Sometimes women were given [[blueprint]]s and [[wiring diagram]]s to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=470}} They learned how the ENIAC worked by repairing it, sometimes crawling through the computer, and by fixing "bugs" in the machinery.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=470}} Even though the programmers were supposed to be doing the "soft" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of the ENIAC.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=471}} When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the demonstration programs it ran for the public.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=472}} None of their work in preparing the demonstrations was mentioned in the official accounts of the public events.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=473}} After the demonstration, the university hosted an expensive celebratory dinner to which none of the ENIAC six were invited.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

[[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to create a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]] and one of the first programmers of the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer, an electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. Hopper's work with computers started in 1943, when she started working at the [[Bureau of Ordnance]]'s Computation Project at Harvard where she programmed the Harvard Mark I.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Hopper not only programmed the computer, but created a 500 page comprehensive manual for it.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Even though Hopper created the manual which was widely cited and published, she was not specifically credited in the manual.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper is often credited with the coining of the term "bug" and "[[debugging]]" when a moth caused the Mark II to malfunction.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}} While a moth was found and the process of removing it called "debugging," the terms were already part of the language of programmers.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html|title=Moth in the machine: Debugging the origins of 'bug'|last=|first=|date=September 3, 2011|work=Computerworld|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/googles-doodle-honors-grace-hopper-and-entomology/|title=Google Honors Grace Hopper...and a "bug"|last=Pearson|first=Gwen|date=December 9, 2013|work=WIRED|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace Hopper continued to contribute to computer science through the 1950s. She brought the idea of using compilers from her time at Harvard to [[UNIVAC]] which she joined in 1949.{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=84-85}}{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}} Other women who were hired to program UNIVAC included [[Adele Mildred Koss]], Frances E.

At [[Convair]] Aircraft Corporation, [[Joyce Currie Little]] was one of the original programmers for analyzing data received from the wind tunnels.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=182}} She used [[Punched card|punch cards]] on an [[IBM 650]] which was located in a different building from the wind tunnel.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=182}} To save time in the physical delivery of the punch cards, she and her colleague, Maggie DeCaro, put on [[roller skates]] to get to and from the building faster.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=182}} 

In Israel, [[Thelma Estrin]] worked on the design and development of [[WEIZAC]], one of the world's first large-scale programmable electronic computers.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=178}} In the [[Soviet Union]] the IT industry was dominated by women; a team of them designed the first digital computer in 1951.{{sfn|Abbate|2012|p=4}} In the UK[[Kathleen Booth|, Kathleen Booth]] worked with her husband, [[Andrew Donald Booth|Andrew Booth]] on several computers at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/site/assets/files/1029/50yearsofcomputing.pdf|title=School of Computer Science &amp; Information Systems: A Short History|last=Johnson|first=Roger|publisher=Birkbeck College, University of London|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Booth was the programmer and Andrew built the machines.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Kathleen developed [[Assembly language|Assembly Language]] at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/eile/brainstorm/2018/0110/932241-the-women-who-led-the-way-in-computer-programming/|title=The women who led the way in computer programming|last=Connolly|first=Cornelia|date=2018-01-10|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-11-25|last2=Hall|first2=Tony|language=en|last3=Lenaghan|first3=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele Mildred Koss, who had worked at UNIVAC with Hopper, started work at [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) in 1965.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} There she developed algorithms for graphics, including graphic storage and retrieval.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

[[Mary K. Hawes]] of [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroghs Corporation]] set up a meeting in 1959 to discuss the creation a computer language that would be shared between businesses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Six people, including Hopper, attended to discuss the philosophy of creating a common business language (CBL).{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Hopper became involved in developing [[COBOL]] (Common Business Oriented Language) where she innovated new symbolic ways to write computer code.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper developed programming language that was easier to read and "self-documenting."{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=92}} After COBOL was submitted to the [[CODASYL]] Executive Committee, Betty Holberton did further editing on the language before it was submitted to the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] in 1960.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} IBM were slow to adopt COBOL, which hindered its progress but it was accepted as a standard in 1962, after Hopper had demonstrated the compiler working both on UNIVAC and RCA computers.{{sfn|Marx|2004|p=60}} The development of COBOL led to the generation of compilers and generators, most of which were created or refined by women such as Koss, Nora Moser, Deborah Davidson, Sue Knapp, Gertrude Tierney and [[Jean E. Sammet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=73}}

Sammet, who worked at IBM starting in 1961 was responsible for developing the programming language, [[FORMAC]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} She  published a book, ''Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals'' (1969), which was considered the "standard work on programming languages," according to Denise Gürer {{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} It was "one of the most used books in the field," according to ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24510360/|title=Computer Authority to Speak Here|last=|first=|date=April 9, 1972|work=The Times|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1961 and 1963, [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] began to study software reliability while she was working at the US SAGE air defense system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/margaret-hamilton/|title=Margaret Hamilton|last=|first=|date=|website=Computer History Museum|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, she was responsible for programming the software for the onboard flight software on the [[Apollo program|Apollo mission]] computers.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/|title=Her Code Got Humans on the Moon—And Invented Software Itself|last=Harvey IV|first=Harry Gould|date=13 October 2015|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hamilton had completed the program, the code was sent to [[Raytheon]] where "expert seamstresses" called the "Little Old Ladies" actually hardwired the code by threading copper wire through magnetic rings.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Each system could store more than 12,000 words that were represented by the copper wires.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In 1964, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] announced a "White-Hot" revolution in technology, that would give greater prominence to IT work. As women still held most computing and programming positions at this time, it was hoped that it would give them more positive career prospects.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=14}} In 1965, [[Mary Kenneth Keller|Sister Mary Kenneth Keller]] became the first American woman to earn a doctorate in computer science.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180}} Keller helped develop [[BASIC]] while working as a graduate student at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], where the university "broke the 'men only' rule" so she could use its computer science center.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180-181}}

[[Christine Darden]] began working for NASA's computing pool in 1967 having graduated from the [[Hampton Institute]].{{sfn|Edwards|Harris|2016|p=50}} Women were involved in the development of [[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]], including [[Judy Clapp]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} She created the prototype for an air defense system for Whirlwind which used radar input to track planes in the air and could direct aircraft courses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

In 1969, [[Elizabeth J. Feinler|Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler]], who was working for [[Stanford University|Stanford]], made the first Resource Handbook for [[ARPANET]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=112}} This led to the creation of the ARPANET directory, which was built by Feinler with a staff of mostly women.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=113}} Without the directory, "it was nearly impossible to navigate the ARPANET."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=116}} 

By the end of the decade, the general demographics of programmers had shifted away from being predominantly women, as they had before the 1940s.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=1}} Though women accounted for around 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during the 1960s, few were promoted to leadership roles and women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76-77}} ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' ran an article in the April 1967 issue about women in programming called "The Computer Girls."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=75}} Even while magazines such as ''Cosmopolitan'' saw a bright future for women in computers and computer programming in the 1960s, the reality was that women were still being marginalized.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}}

In the early 1970s, Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called [[Project One (San Francisco)|Project One]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=100}} Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the [[Internet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}} To work on the project, Hardt-English obtained an expensive [[SDS 940|SDS-940]] computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=98}} They created an electronic library and housed it in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=101}} This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, [[Jude Milhon]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=102}} After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database and a Social Services Referral Directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=104-105}} Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=106-107}} The database was maintained and in use until 2009.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=107}}

In the early 1970s, Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler, who worked on the Resource Directory for ARPANET, and her team created the first [[WHOIS]] directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} Feinler set up a server at the [[Domain name registry|Network Information Center]] (NIC) at Stanford which would work as a directory that could retrieve relevant information about a person or entity.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} She and her team worked on the creation of [[Domain name|domains]], with Feinler suggesting that domains be divided by categories based on where the computers were kept.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120}} For example, military computers would have the domain of .mil, computers at educational institutions would have .edu.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120-121}} Feinler worked for NIC until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/elizabeth-jake-feinler/|title=Before Google and GoDaddy, There Was Elizabeth Feinler|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=June 18, 2012|work=WIRED|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to reduce the gender disparity in IT and get more women involved in computing again. A 2001 survey found that while both sexes use computers and the internet in equal measure, women were still five times less likely to choose it as a career or study the subject beyond standard secondary education.{{sfn|Frieze|Quesenberry|2015|p=15}} Journalist [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] said a key problem has been [[personality test]]s in job interviews and the belief that good programmers are introverts, which tends to self-select the stereotype of an antisocial white male nerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview|title=Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley|first=Emily|last=Chang|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
