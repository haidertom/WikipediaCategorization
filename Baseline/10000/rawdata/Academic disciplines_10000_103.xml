The '''''Ananga Ranga''''' (अनंगरंग ''Stage of Love'') or '''''Kamaledhiplava''''' (कमलेधिप्लव ''Boat in the Sea of Love'') is an Indian [[sex manual]] written by [[Kalyana malla]] in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|author1=Frayser, S.G.|author2=Whitby, T.J.|date=1995|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563081316|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA143|page=143|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet wrote the work in honor of [[Lad Khan]], son of [[Ahmed Khan Lodi]]. He was related to the [[Lodi dynasty]], which from 1451 to 1526 ruled [[Delhi Sultanate|from Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kamashastra.com/kamaint.htm ''Introduction to the History of Sex Manuals'' by Kamashastra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114008/http://kamashastra.com/kamaint.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators have said it is aimed specifically at preventing the separation of a husband and wife. This work is often compared to the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', on which it draws.

== Overview ==
It was translated into English in the year 1885, under the editorship of Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] and subsequently burnt by his wife [[Isabel Burton]] in the weeks following his death.

"Satisfaction and enjoyment comes for a man with possession of a beautiful woman. Men marry because of the peaceful gathering, love, and comfort and they often get nice and attractive women. But the men do not give the women full satisfaction. The reason is due to the ignorance of the writings of the [[Kamashastra]] and the disdain of the different types of women. These men view women only from the perspective of an animal. They are foolish and spiritless".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ganganagarmasti.blogspot.com/2007/04/ananga-ranga.html |title=KAMASUTRA: ananga ranga |publisher=ganganagarmasti.blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was intended to show that a woman is enough for a man. The book provides instructions in how a [[husband]] can promote the love for his [[wife]] through [[sex|sexual pleasure]]. The husband can so greatly enjoy living with his wife, that it is as if he had lived with 32 different women. The increasingly varied sexual pleasures are able to produce harmony, thus preventing the married couple from getting tired of one another. In addition to the extensive catalogue of [[human sexual behavior|sexual positions]] for both partners, there are details regarding [[foreplay]] and [[seduction|lure]].

The contents of the chapters of Burton's translation of the ''Ananga Ranga'' are as follows:
* Chapter I: considers the four classes of women
* Chapter II: Of the Various Seats of Passion in Women
* Chapter III: Of the Different Kinds of Men and Women
* Chapter IV: Description of the General Qualities, Characteristics, Temperaments, Etc., of Women.
* Chapter V: Characteristics of the Women of Various Lands
* Chapter VI: Treating of Vashikarana
* Chapter VII: Of Different Signs in Men and Women
* Chapter VIII: Treating of External Enjoyments
* Chapter IX: Treating of Internal Enjoyments in Its Various Forms
* Appendix I: Astrology in Connection With Marriage
* Appendix II: ''(considers a variety of alchemical recipes, which are either potentially lethal, or completely ineffective as a remedy, or both)''

[[File:Paul Berg in 1980.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Berg]], a leading researcher in the field of [[recombinant DNA technology]], who subsequently shared the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]], helped organize the conference.]]
The '''Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA''' was an influential [[academic conference|conference]] organized by [[Paul Berg]]&lt;ref&gt;“First recombinant DNA.” The Human Genome Project. http://www.genome.gov/25520302 accessed 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the potential [[biohazard]]s and regulation of [[biotechnology]], held in February 1975 at a conference center at [[Asilomar State Beach]].&lt;ref name="asilomar"&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975): 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of about 140 professionals (primarily [[biologist]]s, but also including [[lawyer]]s and [[physician]]s) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of [[recombinant DNA]] technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the [[precautionary principle]].

The effects of these guidelines are still being felt through the biotechnology industry and the participation of the general public in scientific discourse.&lt;ref name="recombinant"&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995): 9011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to potential safety hazards, scientists worldwide had halted experiments using recombinant DNA technology, which entailed combining DNAs from different organisms.&lt;ref name="asilomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="recombinant" /&gt; After the establishment of the guidelines during the conference, scientists continued with their research, which increased fundamental knowledge about biology and the public's interest in [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), pp. 9011-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background: recombinant DNA technology==
[[Recombinant DNA]] technology arose as a result of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA produced through the combined efforts of [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], [[Francis Crick]],and [[Rosalind Franklin]]. Further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation, 1972-1982." ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'', 2nd Series, Vol. 2 (1986): 305&lt;/ref&gt; One of these capacities was recombinant DNA technology.

===Experimental design===
This technology entails the joining of DNA from different species and the subsequent insertion of the hybrid DNA into a host cell. One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford by the name of Paul Berg.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage lambda]]. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda. The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985) pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial bio-safety concerns===
Berg did not complete his final step due to the pleas of several fellow investigators who feared the biohazards associated with the last step. The SV40 was known to cause cancer tumors to develop in mice. Additionally, the E. coli bacterium (although not the strain used by Berg) inhabited the human intestinal tract. For these reasons, the other investigators feared that the final step would create cloned SV40 DNA that might escape into the environment and infect laboratory workers. These workers could then become cancer victims.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"/&gt;

Concern about this potential biohazard, along with others, caused a group of leading researchers to send a letter to the president of the National Academy of Science (NAS). In this letter, they requested that he appoint an ad hoc committee to study the bio-safety ramifications of this new technology. This committee, called the Committee on Recombinant DNA molecules of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., held in 1974, concluded that an international conference was necessary to resolve the issue and that until that time, scientists should halt experiments involving recombinant DNA technology.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asilomar Conference==

===Established principles===
The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA took place at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar Conference Center]] on California's Monterey Peninsula in 1975. The main goal of the conference was to address the biohazards presented by recombinant DNA technology. During the conference, the principles guiding the recommendations for how to conduct experiments using this technology safely were established. The first principle for dealing with potential risks was that containment should be made an essential consideration in the experimental design. A second principle was that the effectiveness of the containment should match the estimated risk as closely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference also suggested the use of biological barriers to limit the spread of recombinant DNA. Such biological barriers included fastidious bacterial hosts that were unable to survive in natural environments. Other barriers were nontransmissible and equally fastidious vectors (plasmids, bacteriophages, or other viruses) that were able to grow in only specified hosts.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to biological barriers, the conference advocated the use of additional safety factors. One such safety factor was physical containment, exemplified by the use of hoods or where applicable, limited access or negative pressure laboratories. Another factor was the strict adherence to good microbiological practices, which would limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation. Additionally, the education and training of all personnel involved in the experiments would be essential to effective containment measures.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations given===
The Asilomar Conference also gave recommendations for matching the types of containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations were based on the different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations applied to experiments===
For prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, experiments could be performed in minimal risk containment facilities when the construction of recombinant DNA molecules and their propagation involved prokaryotic agents that were known to exchange genetic information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Berg et al. (1975), pp. 1982-83&lt;/ref&gt; For experiments involving the creation and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules from DNAs of species that ordinarily did not exchange genetic information and generate novel biotypes, the experiments were to be performed in at least in a low risk containment facility. If the experiment increased the pathogenicity of the recipient species or result in new metabolic pathways in species, then moderate or high-risk containment facilities were to be used. In experiments where the range of resistance of established human pathogens to therapeutically useful antibiotics or disinfectants was extended, the experiments were to be undertaken only in moderate or high-risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with animal viruses, experiments that involved the linkage of viral genomes or genome segments to prokaryotic vectors and their propagation in prokaryotic cells were to be conducted only with vector-host systems that had demonstrated restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in moderate risk containment facilities. As safer vector-host systems became available, such experiments could be performed in low risk facilities. In experiments designed to introduce or propagate DNA from non-viral or other low risk agents in animal cells, only low risk animal DNA could be used as vectors and the manipulations were to be confined to moderate risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

With eukaryotes, attempts to clone segments of DNA using recombinant DNA technology from warm-blooded vertebrates genomes were to be performed only with vector-host systems that had demonstrably restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in a moderate risk containment facility. This was because they potentially contained cryptic viral genomes that were potentially pathogenic to humans. However, unless the organism made a dangerous product, recombinant DNAs from cold-blooded vertebrates and all other lower eukaryotes could be constructed and propagated with the safest vector-host system available in low risk containment facilities. Additionally, purified DNA from any source that performed known functions and was judged to be non-toxic could be cloned with available vectors in low risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Prohibited experiments===
In addition to regulating the experiments that were conducted, the guidelines also forbade the performance of other experiments. One such experiment was the cloning of recombinant DNAs derived from highly pathogenic organisms. In addition, neither the cloning of DNA containing toxin genes, nor large scale experiments using recombinant DNAs that were able to make products that were potentially harmful to humans, animals or plants were allowed under the guidelines. These experiments were banned because the potential biohazards could not be contained by the then current safety precautions.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Science and the general public===
The participants of the Asilomar Conference also endeavored to bring science into the domain of the general public, with a possible motivation being the [[Watergate scandal]]. The scandal resulted from a bungled break-in at the Watergate hotel, which served as the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972. Two years after the burglary, taped evidence was discovered that indicated that President Nixon had discussed a cover-up a week after it. Three days following the release of the tape, Nixon resigned from his presidential office. This event focused the nation's attention on the problem of government secrecy fostering illegal and immoral behavior and it has been suggested by the political scientist, Ira H. Carmen, that this motivated the scientists at the Asilomar Conference to bring science into the public eye to ensure that they would not be accused of a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Smoller. “Watergate Revisited.” ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (June 1992): 225; and Carmen, ''Cloning and the Constitution'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to Dr. Berg and Dr. Singer, by being forthright, scientists avoided restrictive legislation due to the development of a consensus on how they were to conduct their research.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), p. 9012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing science into the public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which recombinant DNA technology entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more from the private sector and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of recombinant DNA.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and that the research could be conducted safely.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics? The Production of Scientific Consensus on the Hazards of Recombinant DNA Technology.” ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Nov. 1986). pp. 595-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was seen in the Ascot report, found in the Federal Register in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of recombinant DNA to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics?”, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on recombinant DNA continued to expand.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"/&gt;

==Significance of the conference==
Years after the conference, people ascribed a large amount of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and [[Maxine Singer]] in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the public discussion of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had become a part of the daily press and television news. This, in turn, stimulated knowledgeable public discussion about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from genetic medicine and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Bradford's law''' is a pattern first described by [[Samuel C. Bradford]] in 1934 that estimates the [[exponential decay|exponentially]] [[diminishing returns]] of searching for references in  [[science journal]]s. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Paul E. 
|title=''Bradford's law'', in Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures 
|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=2004-12-12 |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bradfordsLaw.html |accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of related  formulations of the principle.

In many disciplines this pattern is called a [[Pareto distribution]]. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core [[scientific journal]]s for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.

Different researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like [[Zipf's law]], to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty it is sufficient to identify the "core publications" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.

However its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s famous article ''[[As We May Think]]'', [[Eugene Garfield]] at the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His [[Citation index|Science Citation Index]] (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the  discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were core for all of [[hard science]]. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

The result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of "core journals" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.

Bradford's law is also known as '''Bradford's law of scattering''' and as the '''Bradford distribution'''. This law or distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Don

==Scattering==
Hjørland and Nicolaisen (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;103) identified three kinds of scattering:
#Lexical scattering. The scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts.
#Semantic scattering. The scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts.
#Subject scattering. The scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

They found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.

==Law's interpretations==

The interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/3q8305kq4154w846 Yatsko V. A. The Interpretation of Bradford’s Law in Terms of Geometric Progression IN: Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics, 2012, Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 112–117.]&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals.  V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (e.g. successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).

Some commentators have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which one can organize the human activity and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, maximize [[efficiency]], and eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to [[individual freedom]], with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal "[[iron cage]]" of rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "bureaucracy" is French in origin and combines the French word ''bureau'' – desk or office – with the Greek word κράτος (''Kratos'') – rule or political power.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bureaucracy |title= Bureaucracy | type = definition | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coined in the mid-18th century by the French economist [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Riggs | first = Fred W | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000366/036645fo.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] |trans-title=Introduction: semantic evolution of the ‘bureaucracy’ term | language = fr | title = Introduction : Évolution sémantique du terme 'bureaucratie' | journal = Revue internationale des sciences sociales | publisher = Unesco | place = Paris | volume = XXX I | year = 1979 | number = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a satirical pejorative from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Anter, Andreas. [http://trivium.revues.org/3794 L'histoire de l'État comme histoire de la bureaucratie]. ''Trivium'', 7; 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay never wrote the term down but was later quoted at length in a letter from a contemporary:
{{quotation |The late M. de Gournay... sometimes used to say: "We have an illness in France which bids fair to play havoc with us; this illness is called bureaumania." Sometimes he used to invent a fourth or fifth form of government under the heading of "bureaucracy."|[[Baron von Grimm]]&lt;ref name= "Handbook"/&gt;}}

The first known English-language use dates to 1818.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"/&gt; Here, too, the sense was pejorative, with Irish novelist [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Lady Morgan]] referring to "the Bureaucratie, or office tyranny, by which Ireland has so long been governed."&lt;ref name = "lady morgan"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nCc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35|title=Florence Macarthy|first= Sydney|last=Lady Morgan|accessdate= 2014-11-18|page=35|year=1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, the word was being used in a more neutral sense, referring to a system of public administration in which offices were held by unelected career officials. In this sense "bureaucracy" was seen as a distinct form of management, often subservient to a monarchy.&lt;ref name= "google1"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KtFI15WCr_8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Bureaucracy|first=David|last= Beetham|publisher= Google |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the definition was expanded by the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] to include any system of administration conducted by trained professionals according to fixed rules.&lt;ref name= "google1"/&gt; Weber saw the bureaucracy as a relatively positive development; however, by 1944 the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises noted that the term bureaucracy was "always applied with an opprobrious connotation,"&lt;ref name= "Mises" /&gt; and by 1957 the American sociologist Robert Merton noted that the term "[[bureaucrat]]" had become an [[epithet]].&lt;ref name= "Merton" /&gt;

==History==

===Ancient===
[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|Students competed in [[imperial examination]]s to receive a position in the bureaucracy of [[ancient China]].]]
Although the term "bureaucracy" was not coined until the mid 18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems are much older. The development of writing (ca. 3500 BC) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy is in ancient [[Sumer]], where an emergent class of [[scribe]]s used [[clay tablet]]s to administer the harvest and allocate its spoils.&lt;ref name="Scribes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|editor=Jack M. Sasson|year=1995|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|chapter=The Scribes and Scholars of Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Laurie E. Pearce|pages=2265–2278|url=https://www.academia.edu/562267/The_scribes_and_scholars_of_ancient_Mesopotamia|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]] also had a hereditary class of scribes that administered the [[civil service]] bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Scribal training"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scribal Training in Ancient Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=92|number=2|year=1972|author=Ronald J. Williams|jstor=600648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was administered by a hierarchy of regional proconsuls and their deputies. The reforms of [[Diocletian]] doubled the number of administrative districts and led to a large-scale expansion of Roman bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;As taken from the ''[[Laterculus Veronensis]]'' or ''Verona List'', reproduced in Barnes, ''New Empire'', chs. 12–13 (with corrections in T.D. Barnes, "Emperors, panegyrics, prefects, provinces and palaces (284–317)", ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 9 (1996): pp. 539–42). See also: Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9; Cascio, "The New State of Diocletian and Constantine" (CAH), 179; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christian author [[Lactantius]] claimed that Diocletian's reforms led to widespread economic stagnation, since "the provinces were divided into minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each territory."&lt;ref name="Lactantius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lactantius|author-link=Lactantius|title=On the Manner in which the Persecutors Died|chapter=Chapter 7|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Empire split, the [[Byzantine Empire]] developed a notoriously [[Byzantine bureaucracy|complicated administrative hierarchy]], and in time the term "Byzantine" came to refer to any complex bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/byzantine|title=Byzantine – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient China]], the [[Han dynasty]] established a complicated bureaucracy based on the teachings of [[Confucius]], who emphasized the importance of [[Li (Confucian)|ritual]] in a family, relationships, and politics.&lt;ref name="Confucius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Riegel, Jeffrey|chapter=Confucius|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Spring 2012|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent Dynasty, the bureaucracy evolved. During the [[Song dynasty]], the bureaucracy became [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. Following the [[Song dynasty|Song]] reforms, [[imperial examination|competitive exams]] were held to determine who was qualified to hold a given position.&lt;ref name="McKnight1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=Brian E.|title=Village and Bureaucracy in Southern Sung China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEr8_6LieVMC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=1983-02-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56060-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial examination system lasted until 1905, six years before the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]], marking the end of China's traditional bureaucratic system.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Modern===
====The United Kingdom====
[[File:London customs house 18th century.jpg|thumb|The 18th century [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] developed a sophisticated bureaucracy. Pictured, the [[Custom House, London]].]]
A modern form of bureaucracy evolved in the expanding [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] in the United Kingdom during the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{original research inline|date=June 2016}} The relative efficiency and professionalism in this state-run authority allowed the government to impose a very large [[tax burden]] on the population and raise great sums of money for [[military budget|war expenditure]]. According to [[Niall Ferguson]], the bureaucracy was based on "recruitment by examination, training, promotion on merit, regular salaries and pensions, and standardized procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwfbPVMb_wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Cash Nexus: Money and Politics in Modern History, 1700-2000|author=Niall Ferguson|year=2013|publisher=Penguin UK|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was subject to a strict hierarchy and emphasis was placed on technical and efficient methods for tax collection.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of [[tax farming]] that prevailed in [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] states such as France, the [[Exchequer]] was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/workingPapers/2012/WP167.pdf|title=3 Public finance in China and Britain in the long eighteenth century|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPxlQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Linda+Weiss%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Kc8gUqOwGKay7AbL7IFA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw|title=States and Economic Development: A Comparative Historical Analysis|author1=Linda Weiss |author2=John Hobson |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'' (1847) that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].&lt;ref name="Bodde"/&gt; Influenced by the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]], the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than "preferment, patronage, or purchase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf Full text of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222072511/http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf |date=22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|publisher=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Under [[Louis XIV of France]], the old nobility had neither power nor political influence, their only privilege being exemption from taxes. The dissatisfied noblemen complained about this "unnatural" state of affairs, and discovered similarities between [[absolute monarchy]] and bureaucratic [[despotism]].&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Jacoby|title=The Bureaucratization of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGwVaki8uXIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02083-2|page=40-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the translation of [[Confucian]] texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a [[meritocracy]] reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancien regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Western perception of China even in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy; [[Voltaire]] claimed that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and [[François Quesnay]] advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE1"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
The governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress [[Catherine II]] were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire.&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"/&gt;

Napoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system &lt;ref name="EE"/&gt; and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as "bureaumania". In the early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized [[Napoleonic Code]]. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iSkH1Qf6xsC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142|title=Handbook of Administrative History - Paper - J.C.N. Raadschelders|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other industrialized nations====
By the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. [[Max Weber]] was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

The trend toward increased bureaucratization continued in the 20th century, with the public sector employing over 5% of the workforce in many Western countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Within capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of corporate power hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like ''[[The Organization Man]]'' and ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed ''[[nomenklatura]]'' governed nearly all aspects of public life.&lt;ref name="Voslensky"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Michael Voslensky|author-link=Michael Voslensky|year=1984|title=Nomenklatura: The Soviet Ruling Class|publisher=Doubleday|edition=1st|isbn=0-385-17657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of "big government" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient.&lt;ref name="ThatcherBBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewpoints: How did Margaret Thatcher change Britain?|website=BBC News|date=13 April 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22076774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=A Time For Choosing|author=Ronald Reagan|date=27 October 1964|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html|website=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, managers like [[Jack Welch]] gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations.&lt;ref name="Welch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |title=Jack Welch's Encore |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=14 June 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101031942/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function.&lt;ref name="Modernity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199563654.do|title=Managing Modernity: Beyond Bureaucracy?|editor1=Stewart R.

==Theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', published in 1843. In ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', [[Hegel]] had supported the role of specialized officials in [[public administration]], although he never used the term "bureaucracy" himself. Marx, by contrast, was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that "The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society."&lt;ref name="Marx1843"/&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
Writing in the early 1860s, political scientist [[John Stuart Mill]] theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in [[Imperial China]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the regimes of [[Europe]]. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that "a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy."&lt;ref name="Mill"/&gt;

===Max Weber===&lt;!--'Weberian bureaucracy' redirects here--&gt;
{{Quote box
| quote = Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge
|Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge|–'''Max Weber'''&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term.&lt;ref name="BuSach"/&gt; In his 1922 essay ''Bureaucracy'',[https://www.academia.edu/31803869/_Bureaucracy_by_Max_Weber_Translated_and_Edited_by_Tony_Waters_and_Dagmar_Waters],&lt;ref&gt;Weber, 2015, pp. 73–127 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; published in his magnum opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'', Weber described many [[ideal type|ideal-typical]] forms of [[public administration]], government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:
* hierarchical organization
* formal lines of authority ([[command hierarchy|chain of command]])
* a fixed area of activity
* rigid division of labor
* regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks
* all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations
* officials with expert training in their fields
* career advancement dependent on technical qualifications
* qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015, p. 76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber listed several preconditions for the [[emergence]] of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a [[monetary economy]] requiring a more efficient administrative system.&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt; Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and [[transportation]] technologies make more efficient administration possible, and [[democratization]] and rationalization of culture results in demands for [[equal treatment]].&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;

Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to [[rational-legal authority]], indispensable to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Max Weber (2015) extract], books.google.ca; accessed 30 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of [[Western society]].&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt; Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized [[civil service]] of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service".&lt;ref name="Hooghe2001"/&gt;

===Woodrow Wilson===
Writing as an academic while a professor at [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s essay "[[The Study of Administration]]"&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson, "The Study of Administration", ''Political Science Quarterly'', July 1887&lt;/ref&gt; argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that "is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress."

Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, "Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Ludwig von Mises===
In his 1944 work ''[[Bureaucracy (book)|Bureaucracy]]'', the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to "the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life." Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, "What must be realized is only that the strait jacket &lt;!--[sic]--&gt; of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement."&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a "trained incapacity" resulting from "over conformity". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as "arrogant" and "haughty".&lt;ref name="Merton"/&gt;

=== Elliott Jaques ===
In his book “A General Theory of Bureaucracy”, first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55877281|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry,|year=|isbn=0306485540|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:
* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).
* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.
* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).
* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.
* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).
* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2089721|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435824783|location=London|oclc=2089721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy. They also have a practical application in business and administrative studies.

'''Community informatics''' (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with using [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology (ICT)]] to empower members of communities and support their social, cultural, and economic development.&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Gurstein, M. (2007). [http://eprints.rclis.org/10919/1/WHAT_IS_COMMUNITY_INFORMATICS_reading.pdf What is Community informatics? (And Why Does It Matter)], Polimetrica, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;
Community informatics may contribute to enhancing democracy, supporting the development of social capital, and building well connected communities; moreover, it is probable that such similar actions may let people experience new positive [[social change]].&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; In community informatics, there are several considerations which are the social context, shared values, distinct processes that are taken by members in a community, and [[Social system|social]] and technical systems.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; It is formally located as an academic discipline within a variety of academic faculties including [[information science]], [[information systems]], [[computer science]], [[planning]], [[development studies]], and [[library science]] among others and draws on insights on community development from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. It is an interdisciplinary approach interested in using ICTs for different forms of community action, as distinct from pure academic study about ICT effects.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and H. Linger (2009). "Community Informatics and Information Systems: how can they be better connected?" The Information Society 25(4): 1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Most humans live in communities. In some urban areas, community and neighborhood are conflated but this may be a limited definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Leighton|first2=Barry|title=Networks, neighborhoods, and communities: Approaches to the study of the community question|journal=Urban Affairs Quarterly|date=March 1979|volume=14|issue=3|pages=363–390|doi=10.1177/107808747901400305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communities are defined as people coming together in pursuit of common aims or shared practices through any means, including physical, electronic, and  [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strath|first=B.|year=2001|title=Community/society: History of the concept =International Encyclopaedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|pages=2378–2383|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They proliferate even while the ability to define them is amorphous.

To date there has been very considerable investment in supporting the electronic development of business communities, one-to-many  social tools (for example, corporate intranets, or purpose-built exchange  and [[social networking service]]s such as eBay, or Myspace),  or in developing applications for individual use. There is far less understanding, or investment in human-technical networks and processes  that are intended to deliberately result in social change or community change, particularly in communities for whom electronic communication is secondary to having an adequate income or social survival.

The communal dimension (and focus of Community Informatics) results in a strong interest in studying and developing strategies for how ICTs can enable and empower those living in physical communities. This is particularly the case in those communities where ICT access is done communally, through [[Telecentres]], information kiosks, community multimedia centres, and other technologies. This latter set of approaches has become of very considerable interest as Information and Communications Technology for Development ([[ICT4D]]) has emerged as significant element in strategic (and funding) approaches to social and economic development in [[Less developed country|Less Developed Countries]]. ICT4D initiatives have been undertaken by public, NGO and private sector agencies concerned with development such as the [[United Nations Development Program]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]] (SDC), the [[MS Swaminathan Research Foundation]]; have emerged as a key element in the poverty alleviation component of the UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]]; and as important directions for private sector investment both from a market perspective (cf. the "[[Bottom of the Pyramid]]") and from companies concerned with finding a delivery channel for goods and services into rural and low income communities.

There is thus growing interest in Community Informatics as an approach to understanding of how different ICTs can enable and empower marginalized communities to achieve their collective goals.

==Understanding communities==
It is crucial to know how communities are formed and evolved and how the participation to a community occurs and differs while formation process.&lt;ref name="source1" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Azzopardi|first1=Andrew|last2=Grech|first2=Shaun|title=Inclusive communities a critical reader|date=2012|publisher=SensePublishers|location=Rotterdam|isbn=978-94-6091-849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the nature of communities and the participation process will surely ensure designing and implemenameting a successful ICT solution that benefits members of community while communicating with each other or performing certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; The following points include a brief description of the nature of each potential community formation.

===Community as a place===
A group of people may form a community according to the place in which they live, enjoy staying, and work.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; They usually participate in communities within these three places since they gather together on consistent basis so that it is highly expected that such community is formed.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Beside the home and the work gathering, people usually like to spend their time at informal places called third places in where they meet their new or old friends or have a chance to meet new people.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as a socio-spatial entity===
A group of people may form a community as they have frequent direct interactions or live in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The members of such community may have strong bond and focused common goals which give them a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Moreover, as the number of the members increases, the community may become reputable and has a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as links between people===
A group of people may form a community as they have common shared identity.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; People may form such community to support and advocate common shared values, morals or norms in which they believe.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Such a community may have a set of symbols and be associated with a status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The inclusion and the exclusion to such community depend on whether or not a member share the same identity with others in the community.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; For instance, people who descend from one origin may form a community in which only people from that origin can join the community even though they do not know each other in advance.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community of interests===
A group of people may form a community as they have similar affinity for a particular activity, experience, or subject.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The geographical location is not necessary while forming such community, and the inclusion and the exclusion to such community depends on whether a new member has that affinity or not.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities linked to life stage===
A group of people may form a community if they share a similar experience in a distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The experience could be related to the members themselves or to their relatives, such as their children.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; For instance, parents of elementary school children may form a community in which they care about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; As it is mentioned in the previous type of community formation, the members of such community have a common interest which is caring about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; This type of community may persist over time, but the inclusion and the exclusion to it may happen consistently as people are no longer in that distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities of practice===
A group of people who share a similar profession may form a community in which they work to attain their goals and advance in their profession.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; Three important concepts are considered while forming community of practice which are mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In a community of practice, the members have to be mutually engaged with each other by establishing collaborative relationships that will allow them to willingly work on certain joint activities.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In the second concept which is joint enterprise, the members of a community of practice are supposed to discuss and agree upon the work responsibilities so that they can work in harmony, and each member knows his responsibility and his expected contributions to the community.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In addition to these two concepts, the members of the community of practice have a shared repertoire of procedures or ways to perform certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; They usually agree upon these procedures and practices that they establish and develop over time.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

== Conceptual approaches ==
As an academic discipline, CI can be seen as a field of practice in applied information and communications technology. Community informatics is a technique for looking at economic and social development within the construct of technology&amp;mdash;online health communities, social networking websites, cultural awareness and enhancement through online connections and networks, electronic commerce, information exchanges, as well as a myriad of other aspects that contributes to creating a personal and group identity.  The term was brought to prominence by [[Michael Gurstein]].  Michael Gurstein says that community informatics is a technology strategy or discipline that connects at the community level economic and social development with the emergence of community and civic networks, electronic commerce, online participation, self-help, virtual health communities, "Tele-centres", as well as other types of online institutions and corporations.  He brought out the first representative collection of academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|year=2000|title=Community informatics: enabling communities with information and communications technologies|publisher=Hershey, PA, Idea Group Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as Brian Loader and his colleagues at the University of Teesside used the term in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Loader, B. and L. Keeble (2002). Community informatics : shaping computer-mediated social relations. New York, Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

CI brings together the practices of community development and organization, and insights from fields such as sociology, planning, computer science, [[critical theory]],  women's studies, library and information sciences, management information systems, and management studies. Its outcomes&amp;mdash;[[community network]]s and community-based ICT-enabled service applications&amp;mdash;are of increasing interest to grassroots organizations, NGOs and civil society, governments, the private sector, and multilateral agencies among others. Self-organized community initiatives of all varieties, from different countries, are concerned with ways to harness ICT for [[social capital]], poverty alleviation and for the empowerment of the "local" in relation to its larger economic, political and social environments. Some claim it is potentially a form of 'radical practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Garth, Community Networking as Radical Practice The Journal of Community Informatics, Vol 1, No 3 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Community informatics may in fact, not gel as a single field within the academy, but remain a convenient locale for interdisciplinary activity, drawing upon many fields of social practice and endeavour, as well as knowledge of community applications of technology. However, one can begin to see the emergence of a postmodern "trans-discipline" presenting a challenge to existing disciplinary "stove-pipes" from the perspectives of the rapidly evolving fields of technology practice, technology change, public policy and commercial interest. Whether or not such a "trans-discipline" can maintain its momentum remains to be seen given the incertitude about the boundaries of such disciplines as community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hustedde | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Ganowicz | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The basics: What's essential about theory for community development practice? | url = | journal = Journal of the Community Development Society | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/15575330209490139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is a continuing disconnect between those coming from an Information Science perspective for whom social theories, including general theories of organisation are unfamiliar or seemingly irrelevant to solving complex 'technical' problems,&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. and S. R. Barley (2001). "Technology and institutions: What can research on information technology and research on organizations learn from each other?" MIS Quarterly; management information systems 25(Jun): 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and those whose focus is upon the theoretical and practical issues around working with communities for democratic and social change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoecker | first1 = R | year = 2005 | title = Is Community Informatics good for communities? Questions confronting an emerging field | url = | journal = The Journal of Community Informatics | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 13–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neil | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Assessing community informatics: A review of methodological approaches for evaluating community networks and community technology centers | url = | journal = Internet Research | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 76–103 | doi=10.1108/10662240210415844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that many of those most actively involved in early efforts were academics, it is only inevitable that a process of "sense-making" with respect to these efforts would follow from "tool-making" efforts. These academics, and some community activists connected globally through the medium.{{Clarify|date=June 2014|reason=Through which medium?}}

A first formal meeting of researchers with an academic interest in these initiatives was held in conjunction with the 1999 Global Community Networking Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This meeting began the process of linking community-based ICT initiatives in [[Developed country|developed countries]] with initiatives undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]], which were often part of larger economic and social development programmes funded by agencies such as the [[UN Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], or the [[International Development Research Centre]]. Academics and researchers interested in ICT efforts in developed countries began to see common and overlapping interests with those interested in similar work in less developed countries.  For example, the issue of sustainability as a technical, cultural, and economic problem for community informatics has resulted in a special issue of the Journal of Community Informatics &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Community Informatics Vol 1, No 2 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the subject of ongoing conferences in Prato, Italy and other conferences in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciresearch.net|accessdate=2006-11-23|title=Community Informatics Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the beginnings of CI can be recognized from various trials in community networking in the 1970s (Clement 1981). An essential development occurred in the 1990s, due to the change of cost of computers and modems. Moreover, examples of using computer networking to initiate and enhance social activities was acknowledged by women's groups (Balka 1992) and by the labor movement (Mazepa 1997).&lt;ref name="source35" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=Andrew|last2=Gurstein|first2=Michael|last3=Longford|first3=Graham|last4=Moll|first4=Marita|last5=Shade|first5=Leslie Regan|title=Connecting Canadians investigations in community informatics|date=2012|publisher=AU Press|location=Edmonton|isbn=978-1-926836-42-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social informatics beyond an immediate concern for a community===
{{main|Social informatics}}

Social informatics refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization&amp;mdash;including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/ |title=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics |publisher=Rkcsi.indiana.edu |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries, the UK and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sawyer|first1=Steve|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Howard|title=Social Informatics in the Information Sciences: Current Activities and Emerging Directions|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|date=2000|volume=3|pages=89–96|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol3/v3n2p89-96r.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2014|issn=1521-4672}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per A|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions. Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society dictated by the technology's stated capabilities.  Similarly, the socially deterministic theory represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory see technology as the product of human social forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|last2=Edge|first2=David|title=The social shaping of technology|journal=Research Policy|volume=25|issue=6|pages=865–899|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
There is a tension between the practice and research ends of the field. To some extent this reflects the gap, familiar from other disciplines such as [[community development]], [[community organizing]] and community based research.&lt;ref&gt;Stoecker, R. (2005). Research methods for community change : a project-based approach. Thousand Oaks, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the difficulty that Information Systems has in recognising the qualitative dimension of technology research means that the kind of approach taken by supporters of community informatics is difficult to justify to a positive field oriented towards solutions of technical, rather than social problems. This is a difficulty also seen in the relationship between strict technology research and management research.&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"/&gt;  Problems in conceptualising and evaluating complex social interventions relying on a technical base are familiar from [[community health]] and [[community education]]. There are long-standing debates about the desire for accountable - especially ''quantifiable'' and outcome-focused social development, typically practised by government or supported by foundations, and the more participatory, qualitatively rich, process-driven priorities of grass-roots community activists, familiar from theorists such as [[Paulo Freire]], or [[John Dewey#Deweyan pragmatism|Deweyan pragmatism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Some of the theoretical and practical tensions are also familiar from such disciplines as [[program evaluation]] and social policy, and perhaps paradoxically, Management Information Systems, where there is continual debate over the relative virtue and values of different forms of research and action, spread around different understandings of the virtues or otherwise of allegedly "scientific" or "value-free" activity (frequently associated with "responsible"  and deterministic public policy philosophies), and contrasted with more interpretive and process driven viewpoints in bottom-up or practice driven activity.  Community informatics would in fact probably benefit from closer knowledge of, and relationship to, theorists, practitioners, and evaluators of rigorous [[qualitative research]] and practice.

A further concern is the potential for practice to be "hijacked" by policy or academic agendas, rather than being driven by community goals, both in developed and developing countries. The ethics of technology intervention in indigenous or other communities has not been sufficiently explored, even though ICTs are increasingly looked upon as an important tool for social and economic development in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and B. Craig (2006). Incorporating Indigenous World Views in Community Informatics. OTM Workshops 2006, LNCS 4277. Montpellier, France, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg: 237-246.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, neither explicit theoretical positions nor ideological positioning has yet emerged.  Many projects appear to have developed with no particular disciplinary affiliation, arising more directly from policy or practice imperatives to 'do something' with technology as funding opportunities arise or as those at the grassroots (or working with the grassroots) identify ICT as possible resources to respond to local issues, problems or opportunities. The papers and documented outcomes (as questions or issues for further research or elaboration) on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070105200350/http://ccnr.webstylus.net/wiki/ wiki of the October 2006 Prato conference] demonstrate that many of the social, rather than technical issues are key questions of concern to any practitioner in community settings: how to bring about change; the nature of authentic or manufactured community; ethical frameworks; or the politics of community research.

A different strain of critique has emerged from gender studies. Some theorists have argued that feminist contributions to the field have yet to be fully acknowledged and Community Informatics as a research area has yet to welcome feminist interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exists despite the presence of several gender-oriented studies and leadership roles played by women in community informatics initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and practice interests ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

{{One source section|date=September 2017}}

Research and practice ranges from concerns with purely virtual communities; to situations in which virtual or online communication are used to enhance existing communities in urban, rural, or remote geographic locations in developed or developing countries; to applications of ICTs for the range of areas of interest for communities including social and economic development, environmental management, media and "content" production, public management and e-governance among others.  A central concern, although one not always realized in practice is with "enabling" or "empowering" communities with ICT that is, ensuring that the technology is available for the community.  This further implies an approach to development which is rather more "bottom up" than "top down".

Areas of concern range from small-scale projects in particular communities or organizations which might involve only a handful of people, such as [[telecentres]]; an on online community of disabled people;  civic networks and  to large national, government sponsored networking projects in countries such as Australia and Canada or local community projects such as working with Maori families in New Zealand.  The [[Gates Foundation]] has been active in supporting public libraries in countries such as Chile.  An area of rapidly developing interest is in the use of ICT as a means to enhance citizen engagement as an "e-Governance" counterpart (or counterweight) to transaction oriented initiatives.

A key conceptual element and framing concept for Community Informatics is that of "effective use" introduced initially by [[Michael Gurstein]] in a critique of a research pre-occupation with the Digital Divide as ICT "access".&lt;ref&gt;Gurstein, M. B. (2000). "Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the Digital Divide" First Monday, volume 8, number 12 (December 2003) URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_12/gurstein/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  CI is concerned with how ICTs are used in practice and not simply facilitating "access" to them and the notion of "effective use" is a bridge between CI research (research and analysis of the constituent elements of effective use), CI policy (developing enabling structures and programmes supportive of "effective use") and practice (implementing applications and services in support of local communities).

Another way to understand CI is Clement and Shade's "access rainbow" (Clement and Shade 2000).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Clement and Shade have contended that accomplishing insignificant specialized connectedness to the Internet is no assurance that an individual or group will prevail with regards to appropriating new ICTs in ways that advance their improvement, independence, or empowerment. It is an approach which has multi-layered socio-specialized model for universal access to ICTs. It is displayed as seven layers, starting with the fundamental technical components of connectedness and moving upward through layers that inexorably push the essential social framework of access. The seven layers are: 1. Carriage 2. Devices 3. Software tools Internet 4. Content/services 5. Service/access 6. Literacy / social facilitation 7. Governance.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Even though that all elements are important, the most important one is the content /service layer in the middle, since this is where the actual utility is most direct. The upper layers focus on social dimensions and the lower layers focus on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

Many practitioners would dispute any necessary connection to university research, regarding academic theorising and interventions as constraining or irrelevant to grassroots activity which should be beyond the control of traditional institutions, or simply irrelevant to practical local goals.

Some of the commonalities and differences may be in fact be due to national and cultural differences. For example, the capacity of many North American (and particularly US) universities to engage in [[service learning]] as part of progressive charters in communities large and small is part of a long-standing tradition absent elsewhere.  The tradition of service learning is almost entirely absent in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand, (and of limited significance in Canada) where the State has traditionally played a much stronger role in the delivery of community services and information.

In some countries such as the UK, there is a tradition of locally based grassroots community technology, for example in Manchester, or in [[Hebden Bridge]]. In Italy and the Netherlands, there also appears to have been a strong connection between the development of local civic networks based around a tradition of civic oppositionism, connected into the work of progressive academics.

In Latin America, Africa and many parts of Asia these efforts have been driven by external funding agencies as part of larger programs and initiatives in support of broader economic and social development goals. However, these efforts have now become significantly "indigenized" (and particularly in Latin America) and "bottom-up" ICT efforts are increasingly playing a leading role in defining the future use of ICT within local communities.

In Canada, The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) was established in 2003. Their goal is to explore and archive the status and achievements of CI activities in Canada. It is a research partnership between scholastics, specialists, and public sector delegates.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

== Networks ==
There are emerging online and personal networks of researchers and practitioners in community informatics and community networking in many countries as well as international groupings.  The past decade has also seen conferences in many countries, and there is an emerging literature for theoreticians and practitioners including the on-line Journal of Community Informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci-journal.net |title=Journal of Community Informatics |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=Centre for Community Informatics, Research, Development and Training (CCIRDT) &amp; Faculty of Informatics and Design, Cape Peninsula University of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is surprising in fact, how much in common is found when people from developed and non-developed countries meet. A common theme is the struggle to convince policy makers of the legitimacy of this approach to developing electronically literate societies, instead of a top-down or trickle-down approach, or an approach dominated by technical, rather than social solutions which in the end, tend to help vendors rather than communities. A common criticism that is frequently raised amongst participants at events such as the Prato conferences is that a focus on technical solutions evades the social changes that communities need to achieve in their values, activities and other people-oriented outcomes in order to make better use of technology.

The field tends to have a progressive bent, being concerned about the use of technology for social and cultural development connected to a desire for [[capacity building]] or expanding [[social capital]], and in a number of countries, governments and foundations have funded a variety of community informatics projects and initiatives, particularly from a more tightly controlled, though not well-articulated social planning perspective, though knowledge about long-term effects of such forms of social intervention on use of technology is still in its early stages.

=== Public libraries and community networks===
Even though that community networks and public libraries have similitudes in various ways, there are some obstacles that upset the probability of cooperation in the future between them. Albeit both CNs and libraries are concerned with giving information services to the society, an exchange is by all accounts lacking between the two communities. The mission of libraries is frequently rather barely engaged and, with regards to managing people and different institutes, their methodology can be to some degree unbending. Thusly, CN specialists, while institutionally more adaptable, rush to expel the part of public libraries in the community, tending to see the library essentially as a store of books upheld by public subsidizing. Public libraries have a long-standing custom of association with their communities, yet their conditions and concerns contrast from those of community networks (CNs).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of flags and banners''' is the process by which conservators work to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] and restore flags and banners from future deterioration and damage. As a part of [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|Conservation of Textiles]], flag and banner conservation require the care of a skilled and well trained textile conservator, specifically trained in historical materials.

==Material identification==
Historical Flags are often made of [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], or thin [[wool]] bunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials were used in the making of flags, primarily in the U.S. until the mid 20th century. Forensic examination of flags, to the level of examining the fibers of the fabrics themselves, and the threads used to sew the flags, helps identify the period of the materials used and usually is a good indicator of the period of a flag (though not necessarily, in the case of a forgery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Protein Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/77/natural-protein-fibers|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials can be very fragile and require advanced conservation techniques. Conservators are experts in stabilization and preservation of historic fabrics, flags may be in a variety of conditions from good condition to tattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk and wool are protein fibers whereas cotton and linen are vegetable fibers. The process by which they deteriorate will vary greatly and needs to be carefully addressed during conservation and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulosic Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/70/natural-cellulose-fibres-natures-own-fibres|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays many flags are made of a synthetic blend or [[nylon]] materials, which have their own unique requirements for preservation and care.

== Common causes of damage ==
Flag condition often relates to their usage during the war, so some of the most historically significant examples show the greatest damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flags were not limited to damage from war, such as bullet holes or blood stains - which have specific treatments themselves - but also damage from natural elements such as wind, light exposure, temperature, humidity and pest infestation.
*[[Wind]] damage: The mechanical action of wind forces and exposure to environmental effects can cause damage to the filament and is characterized by splitting. Visual characteristics of wind damage include fraying and even shredding in high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearle|first1=JWS|last2=Lomas|first2=B.|last3=Cooke|first3=W.D.|title=Atlas of Fibre Fracture and Damage to Textiles|date=1998|publisher=Elsevier|page=360|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*
*[[Light]] Exposure: Too much light speeds deterioration of textiles. Historic textiles, such as flags and banners should be protected from excessive light levels, and especially from sunlight and fluorescent light, which contain high amounts of ultraviolet radiation - which is the most harmful form of light. Signs of Light damage can include a brittleness of the material, overall color change of the fabric or yellowing/ browning of the textile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Concerns|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*
*[[Temperature]] and [[Humidity]] Fluctuations: Both mechanisms of decay for objects can be attributed to either too low or too high of a temperature, too high of humidity, or too much fluctuation between temperatures or humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=378|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pest (organism)|Pests]]: There are many types of pests, from [[insects]] to small [[mammals]] such as [[rodents]] that can infest an organic collection of all types. In particular, these pests can colonize textiles and cause irreparable damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=376|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the types of pests that can afflict historical flags and banners include cloth [[moths]] and [[carpet beetles]]. It is important to be vigilant of possible signs of infestation and to take preemptive measures to ensure infestation and damage does not occur. Professionals charged with the care and preservation of collections work to develop and enforce Integrated Pest Management plans (IPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8389-1122-8|page=297|edition=fifth}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure proper steps are taken to protect historic items such as flags and banners.

== Common treatments and handling ==
* Cleaning- While many people have experience cleaning everyday textiles, cleaning historical textiles is different. Conservators approach cleaning historic textiles like flags and banner very carefully as each cleaning process can create a little damage. They must weigh the pros and cons of each method carefully before proceeding. Damage such as dyes bleeding, seams shrinking or finishes being lost can occur in the cleaning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vacuuming - also referred to as surface cleaning. This method is employed by conservators when trying to remove surface dirt. Carefully vacuuming the textile on a low suction, conservators will sometimes used a screen to prevent individual fibers from getting sucked up and lost in the vacuum. This method is considered least invasive and often very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wet cleaning- or washing is a more invasive cleaning method, and one that conservators may be hesitant to use without proper review of the textile. Wet cleaning, or washing is an irreversible process, and can cause significant damage. In particular, commercial detergents and other chemicals can increase the rate of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pest Control-Prevention is better than cure. In order to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy it is important understand and recognize some of the key components of successful pest control. 
#Avoid pests- Keep the area clean a clear of clutter and inspect often.
#Prevent pest colonization- follow routine pest management.

If pest infestation occurs it is important to act fast by following the IPM plan and consulting a trusted pest control professional. If individual pieces are attacked it is important to isolate them immediately in a plastic bag or sealed between to sheets of plastic and tape and then proceed with the IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Recognize pests- what kind of infestation do you have?
#Assess the pest problem- how pervasive is the problem?
#Solve the pest problem- follow the IPM and consult a pest control professional
#Review IMP procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage ==
It is important to consider proper textile storage in the design plan of your storage facility. This room should have limited access, in the interior of the building, with no exposure to outside light, temperature controlled, and properly installed monitoring equipment. Like other organic materials, textiles can deteriorate very quickly under fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|pages=69–96}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flags and banner are no exception to this so proper storage is critical in preservation.
* Flat Storage-Flat storage mats are constructed of corrugated cardboard with a window opening that should be slightly large than the textile object. Textiles should be wrapped in neutral pH tissue. This flat mats can then be stored in flat acid free boxes.
* Rolled Storage- Flat textiles that are in good condition and in good strength can be rolled up and stored in tubes. The length of the textile tube is determined by the width of the textile. Textiles should be inter-leafed by neutral pH tissue paper and the textile secured in the tube. Textile tubes should then be stored in flat boxes made of acid free corrugated cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mounted Storage- historic flags and banners are also mounted for display and storage. It is important to keep in mind the condition of the flag prior to placing it in mounted storage.

The '''detective dénouement''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) is a variant on the [[literature|literary]] [[dénouement]] common to [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories.

==Overview==
Detective dénouement was first popularised by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novels]], but is present in many stories, such as the works of [[Agatha Christie]] or in [[Ellen Raskin]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Westing Game]]''.

In detective stories, the dénouement is the segment of a mystery novel in which the [[protagonist]] of the story, or a character serving in his or her stead, reveals all of the clues and lays out the conclusion for the other characters. This is usually in an attempt to show the readers how the character came to the conclusion and figured out the mystery. One famous example of the detective dénouement is the explanatory speech given by a [[forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] after the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the U.S. television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', the title character ([[Adrian Monk]]) usually uses this method with the words "here's what happened." A [[black-and-white]] montage of the events prior to the murder accompanies his narration.

The '''Douglas–Coldwell Foundation''' is a left-wing [[Canada|Canadian]] [[think tank]] devoted, in the words of its slogan, to "promoting education and research into [[social democracy]]." It was founded in 1971, and is based in [[Ottawa]].

The Foundation was named for and inspired by [[Tommy Douglas]], the first federal leader of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] from 1961 to 1971, and [[Major James Coldwell|M. J. Coldwell]], leader of its predecessor [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] from 1942 to 1960. Both had desired a Canadian counterpart to the [[Fabian Society]].

In 1987, it merged with the Ontario Woodsworth Memorial Foundation of [[Toronto]], named for Coldwell's predecessor as CCF leader, [[J. S. Woodsworth]].

The foundation has underwritten biographies of Douglas, Coldwell, [[Clarence Gillis]], [[Stanley Knowles]], and [[Grace MacInnis]], and scholarships and lectureships at Canadian post-secondary institutions. The foundation also gives out yearly grants totalling up to $25,000 for projects supporting its mandate of "promoting education and research in social democracy."

The foundation is a registered [[Charitable organization|charitable]] foundation, contributions to which are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]] in Canada; it accepts memberships and solicits donations from individuals and organizations in the general public. While predominantly associated with NDP members and activists, and concerned in part with the history and future of the party, it is an independent group with no administrative connection to any political party.

Tommy Douglas was the foundation's first president. [[Kalmen Kaplansky]] led the think tank in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Karl Bélanger]] became president of the foundation in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dcf.ca/2016nov24president The Douglas-Coldwell Foundation elects Karl Bélanger as President] ''Douglas-Coldwell Foundation'', November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on [[Easter]] Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening'
in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' to reform [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Swedenborg, E. [http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/ ''The Heavenly Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit [[heaven]] and [[hell]] to converse with angels, demons and other spirits and the [[Last Judgment]] had already occurred the year before, in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html Swedenborg, E.

For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ" in ''True Christian Religion'',&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title=The True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2, by Emanuel Swedenborg |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he published himself.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html |title=Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation? |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully [[divine revelation|divinely inspired]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were "not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odhner |first1=Carl Theophilus |title="Diary" and the Spiritual Body |journal=New Church Life |date=1912 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Church of the New Jerusalem is a branch of Christianity that reveres Swedenborg's writings as Divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/508967814|title=Reasons for separating from the old church. : In answer to a letter received from certain persons in Manchester, who profess to believe in the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, as contained in the theological writings of the Late Hon.

== Early life ==
[[File:Hornsgatan 43 Emanuel Swedenborg Stockholm 2005-06-17 013.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at the former location of Swedenborg's house at Hornsgatan on [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]].]]

Swedenborg's father, [[Jesper Swedberg]] (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family. The first known paternal ancestor was Otte Persson from Sundborn parish, mentioned 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/swedenborg/|title=Riddarhuset - Ätte- och vapendatabas - Swedenborg|last=|first=|date=2017-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], with his sermons in [[Stockholm]]. Through the king's influence, he would later become professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and Bishop of [[Skara]].&lt;ref name="Ugglan"&gt;{{sv icon}} [[Nordisk familjebok]], 2nd edition (Ugglan) ''[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0486.html article Svedberg, Jesper]'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|first=Alexander James |last=Grieve|wstitle=Swedenborg, Emanuel |volume=26 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with [[God]] rather than relying on sheer faith (''[[sola fide]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Svedberg's pietistic interests are described in Bergquist (1999), pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola fide'' is a tenet of the [[Lutheran Church]], and Jesper was charged with being a [[pietist]] [[heresy|heretic]]. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that [[angels]] and [[spirit]]s were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.&lt;ref name="Ugglan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1–19) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel. Lamm himself partially agrees with them, but he maintains that there were marked differences between them too.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703–1709, Swedenborg lived in [[Erik Benzelius the Younger]]'s house. Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delblanc&gt;x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific period ==
[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|The Flying Machine, sketched in his notebook from 1714. The operator would sit in the middle and paddle himself through the air.&lt;ref&gt;Söderberg, H. ''Swedenborg's 1714 Airplane: A Machine to Fly in the Air'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;32, or on the video clip at 5:48 on its timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-k6HRf0E0g |title = Splendors of the Spirit: Swedenborg's Quest for Insight, Part 1 |publisher = YouTube |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : när Sverige styrdes från Skåne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''"The Northern [[Daedalus]]"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier (see [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)]]).&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or "tremulations".

Upon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honour, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;Berquist (1999), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Gordh, E.

''Handbook Clinical Neurology'' 2010;95:557-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) "Emanuel Swedenborg – An 18th century cosmologist" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441–6] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''"Philosophical and mineralogical works''") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm (1987), pp. 42–43, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc and Lönnroth, p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==
By 1744, Swedenborg had travelled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Drömboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, pp. 200–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs drömbok : glädjen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Small Theological Works and Letters" by Emanuel Swedenborg. Edited and published by the Swedenborg Society (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptural commentary and writings ==
[[File:Arcana Caelestia 0001.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'', first edition (1749), title page.]]

In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' or under the [[Latin]] variant ''Arcana Caelestia''&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as ''Heavenly Arcana'', ''Heavenly Mysteries'', or ''Secrets of Heaven'' depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the basis of his further theological works.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge. ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands and [[London]]. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are At this Day Fulfilled from Things Heard and Seen''. From 'De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'', #60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Its Wonders From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #421–535).&lt;/ref&gt; The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'' #33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For an extensive explanation of the inner spiritual sense of the book of the ''Apocalypse'', see Swedenborg, E. ''The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1928).}}

''The Heavenly Doctrine'' also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title = Swedenborg, E.

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, "is something profane" and was not practiced in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1002 ''Arcana Coelestia'' #1002, 1003] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a [[vegetarian]]. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The vegetarian movement in England, 1847–1981: A study in the structure of its ideology |last=Twigg |first=Julia |publisher=University of London |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and [[pigeon pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, C. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epictc.htm ''The Swedenborg Epic: The life and works of Emanuel Swedenborg''] Bookman Associates, 1952, p. 476, # 642).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Earths in the Universe'', it is stated that he conversed with spirits from [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]] as well as spirits from planets beyond the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/EU.html ''The Earths in Our Solar System Which are called Planets and the Earths in the Starry Heaven, and Their Inhabitants; Also the Spirits and Angels There From Things Heard and Seen''] 1758. Also Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 9-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 'encounters', he concluded that the planets of our solar system are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' #6698&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. [http://swedenborgproject.org/2007/09/08/the-life-on-other-planets-question/ The Life on Other Planets Question] The Swedenborg Project 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands because of their freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G. ''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swedenborg's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Swedenborg's crypt in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].]]
In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to [[Amsterdam]] to complete the publication of his last work. The book, ''Vera Christiana Religio'' (''The True Christian Religion''), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to [[Lutherans]], it is the most concrete of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before [[Christmas]], he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 471–476. Accounts of Swedenborg's last days were collected and published in Tafel II:1, pp. 577 ff, 556 ff, 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5plNwQ4xyfwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=john+wesley+swedenborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv48ELMH0Y&amp;sig=xsFqXKc2uEibBH5YjydRkhEJmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0OgTbjLM5TUgQfBsd3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wesley%20swedenborg&amp;f=false |title = Documents concerning the life and character of Emanuel Swedenborg – Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel – Google Books |publisher = Books.google.com |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29.&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', pp. 430ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg's work.)&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''True Christianity, Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Church That Was Predicted by the Lord in Daniel 7:13–14 and Revelation 21:1, 2'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 2006, Translator's Preface, Vol. 2, p. 36 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's landlord's servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was "going on holiday or to some merrymaking":&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In Swedenborg's final hours, his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,

"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted. When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".&lt;ref name="Epic 433"&gt;''Epic'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted, March 29.&lt;ref name="Epic 433"/&gt; |}}
[[File:Swedenborg House London.jpg|thumb|Swedenborg House, London]]

He was buried in the [[Nordic churches in London#Swedish Church|Swedish Church]] in Princes Square in [[Shadwell]], London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1917, the [[Swedish Church]] in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to [[Marylebone]]. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-london-swedenborg-gardens-street.html |title = Street map Swedenborg Gardens, map London with Swedenborg Gardens |publisher=Ukstreetmap.info |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan-M Ewan Munro+ Add Contact |url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/55935853@N00/3111893982/ |title = Swedenborg Gardens, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 - Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/history-of-swedenborg-gardens/|title=History of Swedenborg Gardens - eastlondonhistory.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg's transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people ever since it had occurred.

Swedenborg has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"] An article including a list of biographies about Swedenborg, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Accessed June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources that ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915 that is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The citation "Bergquist (1999)", which is used here repeatedly, appears to contain mislabelled quotes. See the "Talk" section of this page, under the heading "Bergquist footnote problem".}} [[Olof Lagercrantz]], the Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing "a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs".&lt;ref&gt;''en dikt om ett främmande land med sällsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), backpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.

The vast and consistent use of Biblical confirmations in Swedenborg's theological writings led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: "there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings".&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]], in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les misérables]]'', felt that Swedenborg had "lapsed into madness".

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his "experiences" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.&lt;ref name=Korr&gt;Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{efn|The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''. The primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]).}}&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html |title = Årtal och händelser i Jönköping |publisher = Brandhistoriska.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Högberg, ''Stockholms historia'' (Stockholm's history), part 1, p. 342; in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=%22documents+concerning+swedenborg%22+tafel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu-XD4a3Ry&amp;sig=57fzfakBqB4wjrNlLqYXAZYycjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LLi-SfEuhtYwnN_Qqgg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 For July 19 date see especially Documents 271–273 in ''Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg Collected, Translated and Annotated by Tafel, RL.'' Volume II, Part 1. (Swedenborg Society, British and Foreign. 36 Bloomsbury Street, London, 1877)] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the high and increasing wind it spread very fast, consuming about 300 houses and making 2000 people homeless.&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org" /&gt;

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in [[Gothenburg]], about 400&amp;nbsp;km from Stockholm.  He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg.  The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening.  The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.  Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.  The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic31.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 31 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As noted above,  primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (''Documents'' #271–273)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. {{ISBN|91-27-06981-8}}. (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good  friend, Consul Christopher Springer, "one of the pillars of the church, ... "a man of enviable reputation for virtue and intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt S. [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic35.html ''The Swedenborg Epic,'' Chapter 35] Bookman 1952&lt;/ref&gt; "and that Swedenborg's innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.&lt;ref&gt;Berguist, L. ''Swedenborg's Secret'' Swedenborg Foundation, 2005, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;)

It seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg's distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor,&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, L, ''Swedenborg's Secret'' (London, The Swedenborg Society, 2005, p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg's report.  If Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history.  Instead, "when the news of Swedenborg's extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused."&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander.  Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm |title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]] of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia]]. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedenborg Epic'' pp. 278ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), pp. 314–315, There are several different accounts of the events which makes it difficult to conclude the exact details of the event. Carl Robsahm (see [[#Sources|reference]]) reports the story in this way.}}

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), p. 316, there are some ten different reports of this event. There are two trustworthy descriptions, one by Robsahm (writing down Swedenborg's own description) and one by a priest who enquired of the woman in a letter fifteen years later.}}

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence:  Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329"&gt;Sigstedt, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329" /&gt;

== Kant's view ==

In 1763, [[Immanuel Kant]], then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true.  He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Arcana'' or ''Heavenly Mysteries''). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg's psychic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This letter is further discussed in Laywine, A., "Kant's Early Metaphysics". ''North American Kant Society Studies in Philosophy'', volume 3 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1993), pp. 72–74.}}  Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's "miraculous" gift, and characterizing him as "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" and "a scholar," in one of his letters to [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 202, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg's home, found Swedenborg to be a "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" man and here again, a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled ''Träume eines Geistersehers'' (''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'')&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G., Magee, G. E. (Swedenborg Foundation 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a "spook hunter"&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; "without official office or occupation."&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E., Heron, A. (Translator) ''Spiritual Vision and Revelation'', Chapter VI. ''The Mystery of a Date&amp;nbsp;– Fresh light on Kant's Criticism of Swedenborg'', p. 13, reprinted in ''The New Philosophy'' 2001 104:7,&lt;/ref&gt; As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop "ceaseless questioning".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and inquiries about ''Dreams'' from "inquisitive" persons, both known and unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. Did Kant dissemble his interest in Swedenborg? "The New Philosophy" 1999, 102: 531&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]] thought there was a "joking pensiveness" in ''Dreams'' that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether ''Dreams'' was meant to make "metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to ''Dreams'' less-than-enthusiastically as a "desultory little essay".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant never closed off the possibility of [[mysticism]] or spirits in ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' and the exact relationship of his thought to Swedenborg's remains unclear, according to contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 185-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Lutheranism}}
Swedenborg claimed in ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture''#4, ''True Christian Religion'' # 859, 750, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg considered his [[theology]] a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology,&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt; except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to [[philosophy]], a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it ''"darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith"''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bergquist (1999), p. 178, based on Swedenborg's ''Spiritual Experiences'' (1748), §767 (However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]" should not be confused with "[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=1 |title = ML 1 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus' that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven// |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46–50) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&amp;section=52 |title =Marriage Love #52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[God]] and are the basis of [[:wikt:creation|creation]]. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=84 |title=Marriage Love #84 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; charity and faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=fa&amp;section=1 |title=Marriage Love #1 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; God and the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=117 |title = Marriage Love #117 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=83 |title=Marriage Love #83 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve [[wiktionary:conjunction|conjunction]] between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any "Son from eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=175 |title=TCR 175 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the  [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html ''The True Christian Religion'', particularly sections 163–184 ] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/DL.html ''The Doctrine of the Lord'']  (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, various dates)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/njhd.html ''The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine,'' particularly sections 280–310] New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person and that person being the Lord God Jesus Christ.

===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===
''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others.  He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].

Although the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later history ==
Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church.&lt;ref&gt;Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World.

E. ''A Religious History of the American People'' (Yale 1972, p. 483).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg's writings, including [[Robert Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Jeffrey, ''Robert Frost: A Biography'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp |title = Arthur Conan Doyle – The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02 |publisher=Classic-literature.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]]. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of [[Södermanland]], later King [[Carl XIII]], who as the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of Swedish [[Freemasonry]] (''Svenska Frimurare Orden'') built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg's day, [[Johan Henric Kellgren]], called Swedenborg "nothing but a fool".{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' ("''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad''") in 1787. See Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999). (''[[wikisource:sv:Man äger ej snille för det man är galen|Link to the full poem, in Swedish]]'')}} A [[heresy]] trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.{{efn|The trial in 1768 was against Gabrial Beyer and Johan Rosén and was essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with Christian doctrine. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg's death, various [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|interpretations]] of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html |title = Who was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)? |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = 2006-11-19 |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[#Sources|Sources]]" and "[[#Further reading|Further reading]]" sections, below.}} Swedenborg, with his claimed new [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], has been considered by some to suffer from [[mental illness]].{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' (''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad'') in 1787.

He mentions an earlier biography by the Swedish physician Emil Kleen who concluded that Swedenborg was blatantly mad, suffering "[[paranoia]] and [[hallucinations]]. A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in "Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690–691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of "acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]". Another contemporary critique, Foote-Smith E, Smith TJ. Emanuel Swedenborg. ''Epilepsia'' 1996 Feb; 37(2):211-8, proposed that Swedenborg suffered from [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy]]. For a detailed review of these two articles, see the special issue of the academic journal ''The New Philosophy'' [http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/articles/E.Swedenborg/sanity.htm ''The Madness Hypothesis''].)}}
While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish [[Riddarhuset]] (The House of the Nobility), the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] (the Swedish parliament), and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a "kind and warm-hearted man", "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic37.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 37 |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G.''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 202.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/emanuelswedenbor00trobuoft |title = Emanuel Swedenborg : his life, teachings and influence : Trobridge, George, 1851–1909 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher = Archive.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar".&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in the Age of Reason''. (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, pp. 226, 227.)&lt;/ref&gt; Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..."&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

''Swedenborg: his life and writings'' Bath : I. Pitman, Phonetic Institution, 1856) and this second one in 1867. White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function. White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, "turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions," and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

'''Empower Up''', formerly known as CREAM (Computer Reuse Education And Marketing), a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]], was a [[Computer recycling|computer recycling center]] in SW Washington. Started in mid-2002, Empower Up took old electronics in for donation, and recycled/distributed them.

==History==
Empower Up's history can be traced back to a collection event started by the [[Vancouver, Washington|City of Vancouver]] and [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] in June 2001. The success of this collection prompted the city to start another collection in January 2002, to collect only reusable computers and monitors for the community. Due to the success of the second event, comments by sponsors, and the general public showed an interest in these collections.

In mid-2002, after both an event for re-usage and recycling of computers, departments of the City of Vancouver created the program Computer REuse and Marketing, or CREAM. This new organization would have a permanent location, permanent collection sites, and mobile collection units to travel around the area. CREAM would also make sure of the proper disposal of materials in electronics not suitable for redistribution. By 2008, CREAM had distributed 250 refurbish computers to needy families (with the help of [[Salvation Army|Salvation Army Family Services]]), and recycled 3.5 million pounds of [[electronic waste]].

Near the beginning of 2009, due to new laws in Washington, it was recommended that the organization become an independent [[non-profit organization]]. With the help of [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], and Clark County ReStore, the state created a 3-year plan to make CREAM an independent nonprofit. In February 2009, they established their first permanent building in Vancouver.

In April 2010, CREAM's name was changed to Empower Up, with the motto "''Technology Reuse In Action''", and changed to their current logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |title=Empower Up - About Us |author=CREAM |date=April 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144633/http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 Empower Up moved to 3206 N E 52nd Street Vancouver Washington 98663 on St Johns Road. They expanded the Reuse store and added an eBay store. &lt;!-- dubious - discuss? In the future Empower Up wants to promote more artistic ventures with recycled electronic parts and add skills training certifications.--&gt;

On 27 August 2016 Empower Up was shut down permanently, citing "economic pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/jul/26/electronics-recycler-empower-up-closing/|title=Electronics recycler Empower Up closing|date=2016-07-26|work=The Columbian|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminism in the Netherlands''' began as part of the [[first-wave feminism]] movement during the 19th century. Later, the struggles of [[second-wave feminism]] in the [[Netherlands]] mirrored developments in the women's rights movement in other Western countries. Women in the Netherlands still have an open discussion about how to improve remaining imbalances and injustices they face as women.

==History==

===Renaissance and Enlightenment===
The Republic of the Seven United Provinces, known as the [[Netherlands]], was created through the Dutch War of Independence, which began in 1568 and ended with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]]. Women had a limited number of rights, including the right to enter contracts and the right to control their own [[dowry|dowries]]. Though they were still legally subordinate to men, widows such as [[Volcxken Diericx]], an Antwerp publisher, and [[Aletta Hannemans]], a Haarlem brewer, were allowed to continue their husband's business. Girls had no right to an education, and before widowhood, women were not allowed to own property or to participate in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early to Mid-19th century===
Industrialization in the Netherlands brought jobs to both men and women. Labour unions began organizing by the mid-19th century. In 1841, [[Barbera van Meerten-Schilperoort]] founded ''Hulpbetoon aan Eerlijke en Vlijtige Armoede,'' the first women's organization in the Netherlands. Middle class women began to find paid employment, first in nursing. The first department store in the Netherlands opened in 1860, and women began finding jobs as retail clerks. Kindergartens, which had been pioneered in Germany, spread quickly in the Netherlands and needed a workforce of trained young women to staff them. To train young women to teach primary school, middle schools for girls were established in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young women with academic promise could petition for the right to be admitted to an all-male secondary school. Universities were closed to women until 1871, when [[Aletta Jacobs]] gained admittance to study medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated as Europe's first modern woman physician. Jacobs also became prominent in the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the Netherlands. She opened the first women's birth control clinic in Amsterdam in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First-wave feminists===
In the 1883 Dutch parliamentary elections, Aletta Jacobs petitioned for the right to vote, pointing out that she met all the legal criteria, but she was rejected from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event triggered the women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. The immediate result was an amendment to the voting rights of the Constitution in 1887, to specify "male" inhabitants of the Netherlands had the vote, adding another barrier to the women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the ''Vrije Vrouwenvereeniging'' (Free Women's Movement, or VVV) was founded. This was soon followed in 1894 by the creation of a sub-group within the organization, the ''Vereeniging vor Vrouwenkiesrecht'' (Organization of Women's Suffrage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Drucker]] was less concerned about women winning emancipation—which she saw as easily attainable—than women winning equal opportunity in the workplace, a struggle she saw as facing much more resistance from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=45|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, where other feminists in the country pressed for labour laws addressing the specific needs of women workers, Drucker was opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=200|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Drucker's view, "The state should not interfere with men or with women, nor invent a fictive competition between men and women. It should solely recognize people; members of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=179|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker was firmly on the radical edge of feminism in the Netherlands, but she gave speaking tours and published a popular feminist journal, ''Evolutie'' (Evolution). In 1899, she spearheaded a campaign to stop legislation that would ban women under 40 from jobs as teachers or civil servants; after a decade-long campaign, the bill was "crushed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aletta Jacobs co-founded the [[International Women's Suffrage Alliance]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women won the right to stand for an election as a candidate in 1917. They gained full suffrage in 1919. This was relatively early compared to most other European nations; only Finland and Sweden had given women the vote earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women had in part gained the vote to a political compromise "package deal" between socialists, liberals, and "confessionalist" parties. The confessionalists supported state funding for private schools, typically belonging to a religious denomination. This compromise system in Dutch politics was known as [[Pillarisation]]. In the years after women's emancipation, the confessionalists came to dominate moral discourse in the Netherlands, and legislation in support of confessionalist moral views was enacted (prostitution banned, 1912; abortion prohibited, 1911; advertising for contraception criminalized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=184|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthy economy and a rising standard of living characterizes life in the Netherlands during the 1920s. Women, however, faced a backlash against women's rights which reached into the workplace. Women's rights groups multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international feminist organizations gained larger memberships as women worldwide continued to struggle for emancipation. Dutch women were active in such international organizations as:
* [[League of Nations]];
* [[International Labour Organization]];
* [[International Council of Women]];
* IWSA/IAW, the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, after 1926 called the [[International Alliance of Women]].

Women were praised for their resilience throughout the [[Hunger Winter]] of 1944-5 when food and fuel were blocked by the Nazi military. A period of conservatism followed for several years, but two notable legal milestones were achieved during the 1950s: in 1955, the law changed so that women could no longer be forced from civil service jobs after marrying, and in 1956, married women became legally competent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G.

===Second-wave feminism===
[[File:Vrouwenactiegroep Dolle Mina Women's rights group 'Dolle Mina'.jpg|thumb|left|A costume demonstration by the feminist group [[Dolle Mina]] (Mad Mina), 1970.]]

A 1967 essay by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], "The Discontent of Women", was published in ''De Gids'' and is credited with launching second-wave feminism in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste|title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste|date=6 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203876800|page=17|editor1=Rosemarie Buikema |editor2=Iris van der Tuin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, a group of feminist men and women banded together to create the activist group ''Man-Vrouw-Maatschappij'' (Man-Woman society, or MVM). Its dual-gender composition made it rare among Western Second-wave feminist organizations, but it was similar to others in that its membership was predominantly middle or upper class and well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the lobbying efforts of the MVM, a more radical group was inspired. The all-female [[Dolle Mina]] society was founded in 1969, naming itself "Mad Mina" after pioneering Dutch feminist Wilhelmina Drucker. Dolle Mina had success as a consciousness-raising force during the 1970s, mainly through its use of imaginative protests, such as an outdoor "Discrimination Fair" to draw attention to the issue of equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Der Vleuten|first=Anna|title=The Price of Gender Equality (Epub) Member States and Governance in the European Union|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781409498063|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 publication of [[Anja Meulenbelt]]'s novel ''De Schaamte Voorbij'' (''The Shame is Over'') was another important piece of second-wave feminist writing in the Netherlands. The novel was confessional in tone, and made the connection between the body and language politics overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Dutch: on Culture and Society of the Netherlands|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089641007|pages=195–6|editor1=Emmeline N. Besamusca |editor2=J. Verheul }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, the fight for access to abortion, rape crisis centres, and women's shelters became a dominant focus of the feminist movement. In 1980, the government was financially supporting 30 rape crisis centres in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, feminist periodicals multiplied, such as ''Dolle Mina'', ''Vrouwen'', ''Opzij'', ''Serpentine'', ''Vrouwenkrant'', and ''Lover'', and there were several feminist publishing houses in Amsterdam, the best known being De Bonte Was (1972) and Sara (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|pages=154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, an estimated 160 feminist groups were active in the Netherlands, covering 25% of Dutch towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw many victories for the feminist movement, including the disintegration of the male breadwinner logic as the Netherlands began to prioritize re-gearing the welfare state in favor of incorporating women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evertsson|first1=M.|last2=England|first2=P.|last3=Mooi-Reci|first3=I.|last4=Hermsen|first4=J.|last5=de Bruijn|first5=J.|last6=Cotter|first6=D.|title=Is Gender Inequality Greater at Lower or Higher Educational Levels?

==Third-wave feminism==
Despite having won many legal and social battles over the course of the 20th century, Dutch feminists are not ready to claim victory. Feminist activity continues in the Netherlands, and gender equality continues to be a topic of discussion in organizations, and in the media. Areas of concern remain the low participation of women in full-time employment and their low presence in top executive positions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/womens-labour-force-participation&lt;/ref&gt; violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/safety-of-girls-and-women&lt;/ref&gt; and discrimination against ethnic minority women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, the Netherlands has started promoting policies based on gender equality;
and has once been described as having "the most extensive and comprehensive [sex equality apparatus] in Europe"; this is largely due to the appointment of a State Secretary to oversee an Emancipation Council launched in 1977, and its implementation of policies at the local level with help from feminist activists recruited into government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of colour have seen the need to create new organizations to advance gaps in meeting their needs: a Moroccan women's group was formed in 1992, and a Surinamese women's group was formed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' fount that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but with most of the women [[part time job|working part time]].

{{blockquote| Nearly 60% of Dutch working women aged 25-54 worked part-time in 2001, compared to 15% in the United States, 25% in France and 35% in Germany; but where 25% of French women working part-time say they want to work full-time, just 4% of Dutch women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Despite the government identifying this as a social problem in the 1990s, and introducing tax incentives to encourage women to find more paid employment, the opposite happened, and women found a way to use the tax incentives to reduce their working hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of balancing work and home life, parental leave is much more generous in Sweden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a great deal of debate in the Netherlands over whether women simply prefer to care for their children themselves and work reduced hours, or if higher costs are holding women back from seeking further employment. Economist, lawyer and journalist Helen Mees wrote a book exploring the issue of women's low employment rate, called ''Weg met het deeltijdfeminisme'' (''Away with Part-time Feminism'') in 2005. She identified differences between Dutch and American culture that partially explain the discrepancy in working hours between women in the two nations. In her book, Mees discusses the American "marketization" of much of women's former household duties, such as using businesses for laundry, eating out, having groceries delivered, and other services, which are rarely available in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare is the largest expense for two-income families in the Netherlands, and since it is customarily paid by the hour, this may provide an incentive for families to reduce childcare costs by having the mother do more child-minding and less paid employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', fewer men had to fight in the World Wars of the 20th century, and so Dutch women did not experience working for pay at rates women in other countries did. The wealth of the country, coupled with the fact that "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s" meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Netherlands, together with Germany and Austria, were identified by the European Commission as countries with a poor integration of women in the workforce; [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the Netherlands had the highest percentage of part-time women workers in the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071301/http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been criticism that the Netherlands has constructed a policy focused on emphasizing the alleged difference between 'liberated' ethnic Dutch women and 'oppressed' immigrant women, creating a discriminatory dichotomy of "us ''vs''. them".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/ispp/doc_upload/Roggeband_migrant_women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CEDAW]] committee stated that "[t]he Committee remains concerned about the persistence of gender-role stereotypes, in particular about immigrant and migrant 
women and men, both of which are portrayed as being backward and having traditional views about women, denying their right to full development."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Violence against women]] remains a problem in the Netherlands: according to a 2014 study published by the [[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]], the Netherlands had the fourth highest prevalence rate of physical and sexual violence against women in Europe, with 45% of women having experienced such violence, which is well above the European average of 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224554/http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Netherlands was condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1985 in the case of ''X and Y v. the Netherlands'', for inadequate prosecution of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57603#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-57603%22]}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Netherlands ratified the [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] (Istanbul Convention).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures&lt;/ref&gt;

An important (and controversial) contemporary activist  is [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] a [[Somali people|Somali]]-born Dutch-American dual citizen activist, author, and politician. She is critical of [[female genital mutilation]] and [[Criticism of Islam|Islam]], and supportive of [[women's rights]] and [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2015/03/22/activist-argues-for-a-complete-reformation-of-islam/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A '''fiction-writing mode''' is a manner of writing with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.

[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA143 143-65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in ''Poetics'', referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, pp.  3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in ''The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing'' (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called ''fiction-writing modes''—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jessica Page Morrell, in ''Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing'' (2006), mentioned six ''delivery modes'': action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Peter Selgin, in ''By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers'' (2007), mentioned five writing ''methods'': action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.&lt;ref&gt;Selgin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Mike Klaassen, in ''Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life'' (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
{{main article|Narration}}
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term "narration" as a [[rhetorical mode]] of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.

==Description==
[[Description]] is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story.  Together with [[dialogue]], narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.  Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition==
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}
Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information.  Exposition may be used to add [[drama]] to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kernen|Kernen]], 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarization==
[[:wikt:summarisation|Summarization]], or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA144 144-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "tell" in the [[axiom]] "[[Show, don't tell]]" is often in the form of summarization.  Summarization may be used to:

* connect parts of a story
* report details of less important events
* skip events that are irrelevant to the plot
* convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA145 145].&lt;/ref&gt;
* vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA140 140-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introspection==
{{main article|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Introspection may also be used to:
* enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen [[characterisation]]
* increase tension
* widen the scope of a story&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kress|Kress]], 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* play a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene and sequel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickham|Bickham]], 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA12 12-22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA50 50-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recollection==
[[Recollection]] is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character [[Memory|remembers]] a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying [[Back-story|backstory]] by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story.  Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool.  Recollection could be considered a subset of [[#Introspection|introspection]], but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.  Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.  For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA113 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensation==
[[Sensation (fiction)|Sensation]] is used to portray a character's [[perception]]s. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA173 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
The fiction-writing mode of [[emotion]] conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid|Reid]], 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kempton|Kempton]], 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayhE_0hlH34C&amp;pg=PA148 148].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA74 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Action (fiction)|Action]] is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA142 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt; and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
[[Transition (fiction)|Transitions]] in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. 
* ''Interiority''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt; includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Exteriority'' includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dialogue'' represents a character's speech: conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Activity'' includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the mid 19th century Britain faced reduced timber supplies from the Indian sub-continent&lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; (then [[British India]]) and had turned, under guidance from [[Hugh Cleghorn (forester)|Cleghorn]] towards increased professionalism in forestry at home, and in India. In the late 19th century with Scotland, now established as the British centre for forestry &lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; and successful forestry education in established in [[Dehradun]] this fair was held. Countries and colonies were being invited to produce papers and exhibit products for judgment by British and Indian officials.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v30/n771/abs/030337a0.html|title=The Forestry Exhibition |accessdate=10 March 2012 | volume=30|doi=10.1038/030337a0|journal=Nature|pages=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants (in addition to the [[British India|India]] and hosts [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) included [[Cape Colony]], [[India]]&lt;ref name="princebook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prince, Princess and People.

==Visitors==
The, then, [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] visited on 22 &lt;ref name=edinhist /&gt; or 2&lt;ref name="princebook"/&gt; August where they inspected exhibits from colonies and dependencies noting fine wood from [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]].

[[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R.A.Cross]], [[Secretary of State for India]] presented wood from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]&lt;ref name="maceUoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-council.ed.ac.uk/system/files/GC%20Mace.pdf|title=THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MACE|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the exhibition.

==Legacy==
The wood presented by R.A.Cross ([[#Visitors|above]]) passed to the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, [[University of Edinburgh]], and then to the university's general council who used it to make their [[Ceremonial mace|ceremonial mace's]] shaft.&lt;ref name="maceUoE" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

[[File:Great Chain of Being 2.png|250 px|thumb|1579 drawing of the Great Chain of Being from [[:es:Diego de Valadés|Didacus Valades]], ''Rhetorica Christiana'']]

The '''Great Chain of Being''' is a strict hierarchical structure of all matter and life, thought in medieval [[Christianity]] to have been decreed by [[God]]. The chain starts with God and progresses downward to angels, demons (fallen/renegade angels), stars, moon, kings, princes, nobles, commoners, wild animals, domesticated animals, trees, other plants, precious stones, precious metals and other minerals.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

The Great Chain of Being ({{lang-la|scala naturae}}, "Ladder of Being") is a concept derived from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] (in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]''), [[Plotinus]] and [[Proclus]]. Further developed during the Middle Ages, it reached full expression in early modern [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This idea of a great chain of being can be traced to Plato's division of the world into the Forms, which are full beings, and sensible things, which are imitations of the Forms and are both being and not being. Aristotle's teleology recognized a perfect being, and he also arranges all animals by a single natural scale according to the degree of perfection of their souls. The idea of the great chain of being was fully developed in Neoplatonism and in the Middle Ages.", Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, p. 289 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Mahoney, "Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' Vol. 48, No 2, pp. 211-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Chain of Being is composed of a great number of hierarchical links, from the most basic and foundational elements up through the very highest perfection: [[God]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964p59/&gt;

God sits at the top of the chain, and beneath him sit the [[angel]]s, both existing wholly in ''[[spirit]]'' form. Earthly flesh is fallible and ever-changing, mutable. Spirit, however, is unchanging and permanent. This sense of permanence is crucial to understanding this conception of reality. It is generally impossible to change the position of an object in the hierarchy. (One exception might be in the realm of [[alchemy]], where alchemists attempted to transmute base elements, such as [[lead]], into higher elements, either [[silver]] or, more often, [[gold]]—the highest ''element''.)&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

In the natural order, earth (rock) is at the bottom of the chain; this [[Classical element|element]] possesses only the attribute of existence. Each link succeeding upward contains the positive attributes of the previous link and adds at least one other. Rocks possess only existence; the next link up is plants which possess life ''and'' existence. Animals add motion and appetite as well.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

Man is both mortal flesh, as those below him, and also spirit, as those above. In this dichotomy, the struggle between flesh and spirit becomes a moral one. The way of the spirit is higher, more noble; it brings one closer to God. The desires of the flesh move one away from God. The Christian fall of [[Lucifer]] is thought of as especially terrible, as angels are wholly spirit, yet Lucifer defied God (who is the ultimate perfection).&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Nine orders of angels.jpeg|thumb|[[Orthodox Christian]] icon of [[Christian angelology|nine orders of angels]]]]

Each link in the chain might be divided further into its component parts. In medieval secular society, for example, the king is at the top, succeeded by the aristocratic lords and the [[clergy]], and then the peasants below them.  Solidifying the king's position at the top of humanity's social order is the doctrine of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]. The implied permanent state of inequality became a source of popular grievance, and led eventually to political change as in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Censer, Jack R. Censer; Hunt, Lynn |title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0-271-04013-0 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the family, the father is head of the household; below him, his wife; below her, their children.

Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' ranked the angels (c.f. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]'s ranking of angels), and Christian culture conceives of angels in orders of [[archangels]], [[seraphim]], and [[cherubim]], among others.

Subdivisions are equally apparent among animals. At the top of the animals are wild beasts (such as lions), which were seen as superior as they defied training and domestication. Below them are domestic animals, further sub-divided so that useful animals (such as [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s) are higher than docile creatures (such as [[sheep]]). [[Bird]]s are also sub-divided, with [[eagle]]s above [[Columbidae|pigeons]], for example. [[Fish]] come below birds and are subdivided between actual fish and other sea creatures. Below them come [[insect]]s, with useful insects such as [[spider]]s and [[bee]]s and attractive creatures such as [[ladybird]]s and [[dragonflies]] at the top, and unpleasant insects such as [[fly|flies]] and [[beetle]]s at the bottom. At the very bottom of the animal sector are [[snake]]s, which are relegated to this position as punishment for the serpent's actions in the [[Garden of Eden]].

Below animals comes the division for plants, which is further subdivided. Trees are at the top, with useful trees such as oaks at the top, and the traditionally demonic [[Taxus baccata|yew tree]] at the bottom. Food-producing plants such as [[cereals]] and [[vegetables]] are further subdivided.

At the very bottom of the chain are [[minerals]]. At the top of this section are metals (further sub-divided, with [[gold]] at the top and [[lead]] at the bottom), followed by [[rock (geology)|rocks]] (with [[granite]] and [[marble]] at the top), [[soil]] (subdivided between nutrient-rich soil and low-quality types), [[sand]], grit, [[dust]], and dirt at the very bottom of the entire great chain.

The central concept of the Chain of Being is that everything imaginable fits in somewhere, giving order and meaning to the universe.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

== The Chain ==
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|upright|St Thomas Aquinas classified all beings by rank.]]

===God===
God is at the top of the chain and is also external to creation. God is believed to exist outside the physical limitations of time and space. He possessed the spiritual attributes of reason, love, and imagination, like all spiritual beings, but he alone possessed the divine attributes of [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], and [[omnipresence]]. God serves as the model of authority for the strongest, most virtuous, most excellent type of being within any category.

===Angelic beings===
{{further|Christian angelology}}

Angels were beings of pure spirit who had no physical bodies of their own. In order to affect the physical world, angels were thought to build temporary bodies for themselves out of particles of earthly elements.{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Medieval and Renaissance theologians believed angels to possess reason, love, imagination, and, like God, to stand outside the physical limitations of time.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They possessed sensory awareness unbound by physical organs, and they possessed language. They lacked, however, the divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence of God, and they simultaneously lacked the physical passions experienced by humans and animals. Depending upon the author, the class of angels was further subdivided into three, seven, nine, or ten ranks, variously known as triads, orders, or choirs. Each rank had greater power and responsibility than the entities below them. The most common classification is that of St. Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aquinas, Thomas | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.pdf | title=Summa Theologica | authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |date= |origyear=1265–1274 | via=Christian Classics Ethereal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Humanity===
[[File:Die Leiter des Auf- und Abstiegs.jpg|thumb|upright|The mediaeval ''scala naturae'' as a staircase, implying the [[orthogenesis|possibility of progress]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305]]

For [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] thinkers, humans occupied a unique position on the Chain of Being, straddling the world of spiritual beings and the world of physical creation. Humans were thought to possess divine powers such as reason, love, and imagination. Like angels, humans were spiritual beings, but unlike angels, human souls were "knotted" to a physical body. As such, they were subject to passions and physical sensations—pain, hunger, thirst, sexual desire—just like other animals lower on the Chain of Being. They also possessed the powers of reproduction unlike the minerals and rocks lowest on the Chain of Being. Humans had a particularly difficult position, balancing the divine and the animalistic parts of their nature. For instance, an angel is only capable of intellectual sin such as [[pride]] (as evidenced by [[Lucifer]]'s fall from heaven in [[Christian]] belief). Humans, however, were capable of both intellectual [[sin]] and physical sins such as [[lust]] and [[gluttony]] if they let their animal appetites overrule their divine reason. Humans also possessed sensory attributes: sight, touch, taste, hearing, and smell. Unlike angels, however, their sensory attributes were limited by physical organs (they could only know things discerned through the five senses). The highest-ranking human being was the [[king]].

===Animals===
[[File:BonnetChain.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Bonnet]]'s chain of being from ''Traité d'insectologie'', 1745]]

Animals, like humans higher on the chain, were animated (capable of independent motion). They possessed physical appetites and sensory attributes, the number depending upon their position within the Chain of Being. They had limited intelligence and awareness of their surroundings. Unlike humans, they were thought to lack spiritual and mental attributes such as immortal souls and the ability to use logic and language. The primate of all animals (the "king of beasts") was variously thought to be either the lion or the elephant. However, each subgroup of animals also had its own primate, an avatar superior in qualities of its type.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* Mammalian primate: [[lion]] or [[elephant]]
** Wild animals (large cats, etc.)
** "Useful" domesticated animals ([[horse]], [[dog]], etc.)
** "Tame" domesticated animals ([[housecat]], etc.)
* Avian primate: [[eagle]]
** Birds of prey ([[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, etc.)
** Carrion birds ([[vulture]]s, [[crow]]s)
** "Worm-eating" birds ([[American robin|robin]], etc.)
** "Seed-eating" birds ([[sparrow]], etc.)

Note that avian creatures, linked to the [[Classical element|element of air]], were considered superior to aquatic creatures linked to the element of water. Air naturally tended to rise and soar above the surface of water, and analogously, aerial creatures were placed higher in the chain.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

* Piscine primate: [[whale]]
** Aquatic mammals
** [[Shark]]s
** Fish of various sizes and attributes

The chart would continue to descend through various reptiles, amphibians, and insects. The higher up the chart one went, the more noble, mobile, strong, and intelligent the creature in Renaissance belief. At the very bottom of the animal section, we find sessile creatures like the [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[barnacle]]s. Like the plants below them, these creatures lacked mobility, and were thought to lack various sensory organs such as sight and hearing. However, they were still considered superior to plants because they had tactile and gustatory senses (touch and taste).

===Plants===
Plants, like other living creatures, possessed the ability to grow in size and reproduce. However, they lacked mental attributes and possessed no sensory organs. Instead, their gifts included the ability to eat soil, air, and "heat." Plants did have greater tolerances for heat and cold, and immunity to the pain that afflicts most animals. At the very bottom of the botanical hierarchy, fungi and mosses, lacking leaf and blossom, were so limited in form that Renaissance thinkers thought them scarcely above the level of minerals. However, each plant was also thought to be gifted with various edible or medicinal virtues unique to its own type.

* Trees, with the primate: the oak tree
* Shrubs
* Bushes
* "Crops" (such as wheat)
* Herbs
* [[Fern]]s
* Weeds
* [[Moss]]es
* [[Fungus|Fungi]]

===Minerals===
Creations of the earth, the lowest of elements, all minerals lacked the plant's basic ability to grow and reproduce. They also lacked mental attributes and sensory organs found in beings higher on the chain. Their unique gifts, however, were typically their unusual solidity and strength. Many minerals, in fact, were thought to possess magical powers, particularly gems. The mineral primate is the diamond.

==Natural science==

===From Aristotle to Linnaeus===

{{further|Aristotle's biology#Classification}}

The basic idea of a ranking of the world's organisms goes back to [[Aristotle's biology]]. In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode and possession of blood (he ranked all invertebrates as "bloodless").&lt;ref name="Singer, Charles 1931"&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology: A General Introduction to the Study of Living Things''. Oxford 1931.{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by [[natural philosophers]] during the [[scholasticism|Scholastic period]] to form the basis of the ''Scala Naturae''. The ''scala'' allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given ordering: God at the top, dirt at the bottom, every grade of creature in its place. Just as rock never turns to flowers and worms never turn to lions, humans never turn to angels. This was not our lot in life. In the [[Northern Renaissance]], the scientific focus shifted to biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for [[Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturæ]]'' from 1737, where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of minerals, plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Linn1758" &gt;{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Linnaeus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |location=Stockholm |date=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |language=Latin |edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scala naturae'' in evolution===

The set nature of species, and thus the absoluteness of creatures' places in the great chain, came into question during the 18th century. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt; Radical thinkers like [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like [[Henri de Blainville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appel |first=T.A. |title=Henri De Blainville and the Animal Series: A Nineteenth-Century Chain of Being |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1980 |volume=13 | issue = 2 |pages=291–319 |jstor=4330767 |doi=10.1007/BF00125745|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of [[transmutation of species]], for example [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

The Chain of Being continued to be part of [[metaphysics]] in 19th century education, and the concept was well known. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] used it as a metaphor in his 1851 ''Elements of Geology'' description of the [[Geologic time scale|geological column]], where he used the term "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing links]]" in relation to missing parts of the continuum. The term "missing link" later came to signify [[transitional fossil]]s, particularly those bridging the gulf between man and beasts.&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |title=Why the term "missing links" is inappropriate |date=10 June 2009 |publisher=Hoxful Monsters |accessdate=10 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402093028/http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the great chain as well as the derived "missing link" was abandoned in early 20th century science,&lt;ref name=Prothero2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prothero |first=Donald R. |authorlink=Donald Prothero |date=1 March 2008 |title=Evolution: What missing link? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726451.700-evolution-what-missing-link.html?full=true |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issue=2645 |pages=35–41 |accessdate=4 August 2018 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(08)60548-5 |volume=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the notion of [[Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny|modern animals representing ancestors of other modern animals]] was abandoned in biology.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich1963&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul R. |author2=Holm, R.

==Politics==

Allenby and Garreau propose the Catholic Church's narrative of the Great Chain of Being kept the peace for centuries in Europe.  The very concept of rebellion simply lay outside the reality within which most people lived for to defy the King was to defy God. King James I himself wrote, "The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth: for kings are not only God's Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods."&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] broke this supposed divine plan and fought the last vestiges of feudal hierarchy by creating secular governmental structures that vested power into the hands of ordinary citizens rather than divinely ordained monarchs.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.grandview.edu/ssnyder/121/121%20great%20chain.htm |title=The Great Chain of Being|website=faculty.grandview.edu |author=Snyder, S. |access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars such as Brian Tierney&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Reid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Novak&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1990/thomas-aquinas-the-first-whig-what-our-liberties-owe-to-a-neapolitan-mendicant&lt;/ref&gt; have noted the medieval contribution to democracy and human rights.

==Adaptations and similar concepts==
The American spiritual writer and philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] uses a concept called the "Great Nest of Being" which is similar to the Great Chain of Being, and which he claims to belong to a culture-independent "[[perennial philosophy]]" traceable across 3000 years of mystical and esoteric writings. Wilber's system corresponds with other concepts of [[transpersonal psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freeman, Anthony |date=2006 |title=A Daniel Come to Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=95–109 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/13-3_Freeman.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68sTnOHBi?url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/13-3_Freeman.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', British philosopher and economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] wrote that fundamental gaps exist between the existence of minerals, plants, animals and humans, where each of the four classes of existence is marked by a level of existence not shared by that below. Clearly influenced by the great chain of being, but lacking the angels and God, he called his hierarchy the "levels of being". In the book, he claims that science has generally avoided seriously discussing these discontinuities, because they present such difficulties for strictly materialistic science, and they largely remain mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph (2008).

[[File:LOC Court of Neptune Fountain by Roland Hinton Perry - 1.jpg|thumb|222px|right|'' [[The Court of Neptune Fountain]]'' at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington D.C. [[Roland Hinton Perry]]. (1895).]]

The first decorative [[fountain]] in the United States was dedicated in [[City Hall Park]], in [[New York City]], in 1842.  Early American fountains were used to distribute clean drinking water, had little ornamentation, and copied European styles.

In the 20th century, American fountains often ceased to distribute drinking water; they became purely decorative, and were designed to honor events or individuals, as works of urban sculpture or to imitate nature.  In the late 20th century, the [[musical fountain]], where the dance of water is controlled by a computer and is accompanied by lights and music, became a form of public entertainment in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other American cities.

== 1800-1900 ==
[[File:'Fourth of July in Center Square' by John Lewis Krimmel.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Fourth of July in Centre Square'' (c.1809-12), [[John Lewis Krimmel]], [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].]]
Philadelphia built the first citywide water system in the United States, which began operation in January 1801. Underground aqueducts carried drinking water from the [[Schuylkill River]], and twin steam pumps propelled it into a water tower at Centre Square, now the site of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Scottish-born architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] designed the system along with the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] pumping house/water tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schillerinstitute.org/educ/hist/eiw_this_week/v4n3_jan20_1801.html "Benjamin Latrobe Designs the first American Steam-Powered Municipal Waterworks,"] from ''This Week in History'', January 2012, The Schiller Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Centre Square was converted from a meadow into a public park, and an ornamental fountain was added, 1808&amp;ndash;1809. Sculptor [[William Rush]] carved a wooden statue, ''Allegory of the Schuylkill River'' (better known as ''Water Nymph with Bittern''), to adorn the Centre Square fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafa.org/museum/The-Collection-Greenfield-American-Art-Resource/Tour-the-Collection/Category/Collection-Detail/985/coltype--Sculpture/mkey--8434/sort57--3_3a30-/ ''Head of the Nymph''], from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monumental fountains in the United States were built to mark the termini of aqueducts bringing fresh drinking water into New York City. A [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832 and the disastrous [[Great Fire of New York]], in 1835, persuaded the government of New York City to build the [[Croton aqueduct]] to bring abundant fresh water into the city.  The [[Croton Dam]], aqueduct, and reservoir were finished in 1841,  bringing water 40 miles from the [[Croton River]] to New York City.  In commemoration, the first fountain in the U.S., the ''Croton Fountain'' in [[City Hall Park]], was turned on on October 14, 1842 and jetted water 50 feet into the air.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Burns and James Sanders, ''New York, an Illustrated History'', Alfred Knopf, New York, 1999, pg. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second fountain in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] was also connected to the system.

The first fountains were very simple, without sculpture, and simply spouted water up into the air.  They no longer exist, though vestiges of the original water system remain.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, "Fountains as Refreshment", in the collection ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Boston completed its own new water system, an aqueduct from [[Lake Cochituate]] 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) to the [[Boston Common]], where the first fountain was located. A parade and festival were held to mark the fountain's opening on October 25, 1848.  The ceremony included schoolchildren singing an ode written by American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] for the event.  The ode began:

"My name is Water: I have sped
through strange dark ways untried before,
By pure desire of friendship led,
Cochituate's Ambassador:
He sends four gifts by me,
Long life, health, peace, and purity."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Marilynn Symmes and Maria Ann Conelli in ''Fountains, Splash and Spectacle''. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the first American fountains, which were simple and functional, in the 1850s, more decorative fountains were constructed as part of a nationwide effort to beautify American cities by building parks, squares, and fountains inspired by European models. 
[[File:Bethesda Fountain, Central Park.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' in [[Central Park]], New York (1873)]]
For example, the ''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' was created to adorn New York City's new [[Central Park]], which project had been begun in 1858 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], to create a vast [[natural landscape]] in the heart of the city.  In the middle of the park was one formal element: a mall adorned with elm trees and a terrace with views over a lake.  In 1863, the park commissioners decided to build a monumental fountain for the central basin in the middle of the mall.  The sculptor was a little-known American artist, [[Emma Stebbins]], whose brother was the head of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and President of the Board of Commissioners, who lobbied on her behalf.  Her fountain was based on the biblical verse from the [[Gospel of Saint John]], in which an angel touched, or "troubled", the waters of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in [[Jerusalem]], giving it healing powers.  She wrote about the fountain:  "We have no less healing, comfort and purification freely sent to us through the blessed gift of pure, wholesome water, which to all the countless homes of this great city comes like an angel visitant."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, 'American Women Sculptors: A History of Women Working in Three Dimensions'', Chicago, 1990, pg. 63-66. Cited in "The Bethesda Fountain in New York City", article by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', by Marilynn Symmes.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was criticized by some writers when it was opened in 1873: the ''New York Times'' called it "a feebly-pretty idealess thing",&lt;ref&gt;"The Bethesda Fountain", ''The New York Times'', June 1, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually the fountain became a popular favorite, featured in many films and in recent times in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kushner - ''Angels in America part two'', Perestroika, New York, 1994, pp. 143-146.  Cited by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1900-2000 ==
Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.  For example:
*The handsome ''[[Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain]]'' (aka ''Dupont Circle Fountain''), in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington D.C.]], was designed and created by [[Henry Bacon]] and [[Daniel Chester French]], the architect and sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]],  in 1921, in a pure [[Neoclassical sculpture|neoclassical]] style.
*The ''[[Buckingham Fountain]]'' in Grant Park, Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as 150 feet (46 meters) into the air.
*The ''Fountain of Prometheus,'' with sculpture by [[Paul Manship]], built at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, was the first American fountain in the [[Art-Deco]] style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form.  Some, like the [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] in [[San Francisco]] (1971), were pure works of sculpture. The modernist French-Canadian [[Armand Vaillancourt]] built his monumental fountain at Embarcadero Plaza in San Francisco in a [[cubist]] style, though it was intended as a political statement - the official title is "Quebec Libre!", and the artist was arrested at the time of the opening for painting political slogans on his own fountain.

Other fountains, like the ''Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall'' (1997), by architect [[Lawrence Halprin]], were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes.  This fountain is part of the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]], which has four outdoor "rooms" illustrating FDR's Presidency.  Each "room" contains a cascade or waterfall;  the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II.  Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; "the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses."&lt;ref&gt;Halprin, Lawrence, Notebooks 1959-1971, Cambridge Massachusetts (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual modern American fountains is the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] (1989) at the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], designed by [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington D.C.  The ''Civil Rights Memorial'' fountain features a low elliptical black granite table, with a thin surface of water flowing over the surface, over the inscribed names of civil rights leaders who lost their lives, illustrating the quotation from [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:  "...Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."  Visitors are invited to touch the names through the water. "The water is as slow as I could get it," Lin wrote. "It remains very still until you touch it. Your hand carves ripples, which transform and alter the piece, just as reading the words completes the piece."&lt;ref&gt;Zinnser, William, "I Realized Her Tears Were Becoming Part of The Memorial (Maya Lin), ''Smithsonian'' 22, no. 6. September 1991 pp. 32-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==
{{See also|Pasigraphy}}

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:It1927clarabow.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the film [[It (1927 film)|''It'']] (1927)]]

An '''it girl''' is an attractive young woman, generally a celebrity, who is perceived to have both [[sex appeal]] and a personality that is especially engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=It girl | dictionary=Dictionary.com unabridged | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/it-girl?s=t | accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression ''it girl'' originated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith|Etherington-Smith, Meredith]] &amp; Pilcher, Jeremy. (1986). ''The 'It' Girls'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached global attention in 1927, with the popularity of the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] film ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'', starring [[Clara Bow]]. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an ''it girl'' if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty.

==Early use==
An early literary usage of ''it'' in this sense may be traced to a 1904 short story by [[Rudyard Kipling]]: ''It isn’t beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It’s just ‘It’.''
&lt;ref name=KiplingSociety&gt;{{cite web|quote=... she had that indefinable quality which Kipling was the first to call ‘It’ &amp;ndash; sex-appeal without flaunting her sexuality.|last1=Wilson|first1=Alastair|title=Mrs Bathurst|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_bathurst1.htm |publisher=KiplingSociety.co.uk|accessdate=5 March 2014|last2=Wilson|first2=Commander Alastair|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Glyn]], the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled ''It'' and the subsequent screenplay, lectured {{quote|With ''It'', you win all men if you are a woman and all women if you are a man. ''It'' can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.|source=Elinor Glyn (1927)&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;Introduction in the film script for ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (USA, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Glyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller ''Three Weeks''. She is usually credited with the invention of the ‘It Girl’ concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she is definitely responsible for the impact the term had on the culture of the 1920s. 
Bow later said she wasn’t sure what “It” meant,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Waterloo Daily Courier'', 21&amp;nbsp;September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; although she identified [[Lana Turner]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and later [[Marilyn Monroe]]&lt;ref name="Stenn8"&gt;{{cite book|title= Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild| first=David| last=Stenn| authorlink=David Stenn| publisher=Doubleday| year=1988| ISBN= 0-385-24125-9| page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “It Girls”, and [[Robert Mitchum]] as an “It Man”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The fashion component of the ''It Girl'', originated with the celebrated [[couturier]] [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]], known professionally as “Lucile”, the name under which she directed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York; she was [[Elinor Glyn]]’s elder sister. As Lucile, Lucy Duff-Gordon was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music, inspiring the modern runway or catwalk show, and she was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative [[lingerie]] and lingerie-inspired clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Caroline. (2013). ''The Mechanical Smile'', pp&amp;nbsp;34–36, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'' pp&amp;nbsp;23–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucile also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on Broadway to silent screen icons such as [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Irene Castle]].

As early as 1917, Lucile herself used the term ''It'' in relation to style in her fashion column for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'': "...&amp;nbsp;I saw a very ladylike and well-bred friend of mine in her newest Parisian frock ... she felt she was 'it' and perfectly happy."&lt;ref&gt;Duff-Gordon, Lady (Lucile). (1917). The Last Word in Fashions. ''Harper's Bazaar'', ''63'', October&amp;nbsp;1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'', 31, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[It (1927 film)|Paramount Studios' film]] was planned as a special showcase for its popular star [[Clara Bow]], and her spectacular performance&lt;ref&gt;private showing. (1927-01-01) ''Variety''&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term ‘It’ to the cultural lexicon.
The film plays with the notion that "It" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] and a [[femme fatale]], with a touch of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s latter day "[[Material Girl]]" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely (and rich and well-bred to boot), yet she doesn't have "It".

==Modern "It Girls"==
Since the 1990s, ''It Girl'' or ''It-Girl'' has been used slightly differently, referring to a wealthy, normally unemployed, young woman who is pictured in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] going to many parties often in the company of other celebrities, receiving media coverage in spite of no real personal achievements or TV hosting / presenting. The writer [[William Donaldson]] observed that, having initially been coined in the 1920s, the term was applied in the 1990s to describe "a young woman of noticeable 'sex appeal' who occupied herself by shoe shopping and party-going".&lt;ref name=donaldson&gt;[[William Donaldson|Donaldson, W]]. (2002) ''Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominence of an "It Girl" is often temporary; some of the rising It Girls will either become fully-fledged celebrities, commonly initially via engineering appearances on reality TV shows or series; lacking such an accelerant, their popularity will normally fade. Reflection on the celebrity-focused and celebrity-promoting nature of news media &amp;ndash; particularly [[tabloid journalism|tabloid newspaper]]s &amp;ndash; may be helpful.

===Film and theater===
* Glyn's 1927 film script was adapted into a musical called ''The It Girl'', which opened off-Broadway in 2001 at the York Theatre Company, starring [[Jean Louisa Kelly]].&lt;ref name="musical"&gt;[http://www.ItGirlMusical.com  It Girl Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051014205406/http://www.itgirlmusical.com/ |date=2005-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[It Girls]]'' is a 2002 feature documentary film directed by [[Robin Melanie Leacock]], which chronicles the activities of a group of socialites in [[Manhattan]] during [[New York Fashion Week]].

Language management is a discipline that consists of satisfying the needs of people who speak multiple different  languages. These may be in the same country, in companies, and in cultural or  international institutions where one must use multiple languages.

==Cultural Diversity and Multilingualism==
There are currently about 6000 languages in the world, 85 of which are protected by sovereign states.
The universal declaration of UNESCO on cultural diversity in 2001 recalls the richness of global cultural heritage, which comes from its cultural diversity:
"This intangible cultural heritage, passed down from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups according to their environment, their interaction with nature, and their history, and brings a feeling of identity and of continuity, thus contributing to the promotion of respect of cultural diversity and human creativity."
The declaration of Montreal in 2007 repeated this concern.
UNESCO organized a conference on "Multilingualism for Cultural Diversity and Participation of All in Cyberspace" in Bamako, Mali, on May 6 and 7, 2005, in partnership with the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), and the Government of Mali, as well as other international organizations.
UNESCO is otherwise responsible for the introduction of the concept of intangible cultural heritage, which manages the cultural heritage in terms of its information support.

For example, text and images associated with the Louvre museum in France are part of the intangible cultural heritage, and it goes without saying that the diversity of the visitors requires the management of text in several languages.
This meeting aimed to prepare the second phase of the World Summit of the Society of Information (held in Tunis, Tunisia, 16 to 18 of November 2005).
The other part, the phenomenon of globalization produces exchanges which requires the management of different languages at the nodes of interconnection (airports, parking lots, ...).
The Internet, finally, produces commercial exchanges indifferent to linguistic frontiers, and virtual communities, like Wikipedia, are where the participants speaking different languages can dialog and exchange information and knowledge.

==Language Policy==
International institutions, governments, and firms are faced with language management needs.

=== International institutions ===
In international institutions, languages can have different statutes: Official language or work language.

===European Union States===

Plenty of states have multiple official languages in their territory:

This is the case:

in Belgium (Dutch, French, German)

in Switzerland (German, French, Italian, Romansch)

in Canada (French and English)

in numerous African countries, and

in Luxembourg (French, German, Luxembourgish)

In France, where many regional languages exist, especially in the regions on the border (cross-border languages) and in Brittany (Breton) none of them have official status.
Therefore, a certain number of states have put linguistic policies in place.
On a larger scale, the European Union has also defined a linguistic policy, which distinguishes 23 official languages.

=== Impact on School ===
Upon entrance to school, children of diverse cultures are forced to abandon their cultural roots and their mother tongues, to the benefit of the normative language chosen by the school. Research has shown that school, by acting to transmit a country's norms, contributes to the destruction of diversity, can even create in certain children a rejection of their mother language that is shown to be the cause of their learning difficulties.

=== Historic methods of introducing languages ===

== Businesses ==

Many international enterprises are bringing about, in a strategic move toward internationalization, changing the language of work in all or part of their activities.   In an immense majority of cases, the chosen language is English called the 'lingua franca" or vehicular language.   The language of home (mother tongue) is keeping a definite importance in the direction of this lingua franca.   A great number of documents are coming to be published in English. which can become official language in certain meetings, teleconferences, or video conferences.

This poses obvious questions of language management.   How are workers educated in a new language for work in the case that English is not an official language of the country where they find themselves assigned?   What is the pertinence of imposing a foreign language on workers in a company, in the measure of usage of this language as part of their competence and effect on their productivity.   What is the economic equation to resolve between, on one had, the benefits (which may be more important) teased away for the internationalization and the ill-effects of this internationalization plus the level playing field of language, and unforeseen ill-effects which may well be present and the potentially high costs: cost of inefficiency, cost of translation, and cost of professional education.

Language management in organizations has been found to have instrumental consequences as well as identity related consequences (Lauring, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Lauring, J. 2008. Rethinking social identity theory in international encounters: Language use as a negotiated object for identity making. [[International Journal of Cross Cultural Management]], 8(3): 343-361.&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental benefits from language management and the use of a common organizational language could be related to easier access to documents and a generally better communication flow in the organization. However, the use of a common language can also provide a positive indication of inclusion to linguistic minorities. Thereby language management can help to reduce language based feeling of us versus them between different language communities. Some studies have also found negative consequences of using a common language (Marschan-Piekkari, Welch, &amp; Welch, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Marschan-Piekkari, R., Welch, D., &amp; Welch, L. 1999. In the shadow: The impact of language on structure, power and communication in the multinational. International Business Review, 8: 421–440.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using a common language may distort the normal power structure of an organization (Neeley, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Marschan-Piekkari, R., Welch, D., &amp; Welch, L. 1999. In the shadow: The impact of language on structure, power and communication in the multinational. International Business Review, 8: 421–440.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that speaking in a second language can be highly demanding for organization members cause strain on the individual (Volk, Köhler, &amp; Pudelko, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Volk, S., Köhler, T., &amp; Pudelko, M. 2014. Brain drain: The cognitive neuroscience of foreign language processing in multinational corporations. Journal of International Business Studies, 45(7): 862-885.&lt;/ref&gt; Language management has been found to work differently in face-to-face settings compared to virtual teams (Klitmøller &amp; Lauring, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Klitmøller, A., &amp; Lauring, J. 2013. When global virtual teams share knowledge: Media richness, cultural distance and language commonality. Journal of World Business, 48(3): 398–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Madras Institute of Development Studies''' ('''MIDS''') is a research institute based in [[Chennai]]. It is a joint undertaking of the Governments of [[Government of India|India]] and [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] for conducting research on development problems in [[Tamil Nadu]] and the rest of [[India]].&lt;ref name="mids1"&gt;.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MIDS was established by [[Malcolm Adiseshiah]] and his wife Elizabeth Adiseshiah in January 1971. Malcolm Adiseshiah served as its first Director. In March 1977, MIDS was reconstituted as a National Research Institute under the sponsorship of [[Government of India]] through the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] and the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The Adiseshiah's donated the land, buildings, furniture, equipment and made cash endowments to the newly constituted institute. Malcolm Adiseshiah resigned as MIDS' Director in 1978 and became the Chairman and Honorary fellow. Professor [[C.T. Kurien]] became the next Director of MIDS. In 1985, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] established a Chair for applied research in regional economics, which has since been converted to a fully autonomous unit in 2002.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Administration==
MIDS is governed by a Governing Council and an Academic Council. The Governing Council consists of the Chairperson, the Institute's Director as member-secretary, representatives of faculty, the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]], the Government of Tamil Nadu, and from the universities of the four South Indian states, trustees of the Institute, and co-opted social scientists, as members. It ordinarily meets once a year, while its Finance Committee and Executive Council meet twice a year. The Academic Council consists of the Director as chairperson, and both external and internal members. All the professors of the Institute are its members; other faculty members and the Ph.D. scholars serve on it in rotation. Five reputed social scientists from other universities and institutes are members of the Academic Council. Each of them serve for three years. The Council meets twice a year to review, and provide guidelines on, the academic activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Academics==
MIDS' research focuses on subjects like development and planning, centre-state relationship, poverty, inequality, agrarian issues, social movements, caste and communal politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldis.org/go/home&amp;id=4394&amp;type=Organisation&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a full-time doctoral program under three classes - Indian Council of Social Science Research fellowships, RBI{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=what is this jargon?}} fellowships and Malcolm &amp; Elizabeth Adiseshiah Ph.D. Merit Scholarship. It also offers an annual award called "The Malcolm Adiseshiah award" for mid-career academicians in the field of developmental studies. Prominent faculty members of MIDS (both past and present) include [[Kaushik Basu]], [[A R Venkatachalapathy]], Padmini Swaminathan and  K. Nagaraj. Its publication cell publishes books and academic papers (sometimes in collaboration with Kalachuvadu Pathippagam, a Tamil publishing house). It also brings out a bi-annual bulletin called "Review of Development and Change".&lt;ref name="mids2"&gt;.

== Concepts and issues ==

Key concepts of Marxist sociology include [[historical materialism]], [[Mode of production|modes of production]], and the relation between [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labour]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; Marxist sociology is primarily concerned with, but not limited to, the relations between society and economics.&lt;ref name="section"/&gt; Marxist Sociology is also concerned with the way in which police forces are used to control indigenous polulations, enslaved peoples, and the laboring poor in the name of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1028737741|title=Police : a field guide|last=1968-|first=Correia, David,|others=Wall, Tyler,|isbn=9781786630148|location=London|oclc=1028737741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key questions asked by Marxist sociologists include:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;
* How does capital control workers?
* How does a mode of production influence the [[social class]]?
* What is the relation between workers, capital, [[State (polity)|the state]] and [[culture]]?
* How do economic factors influence inequalities such as those relating to [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]?
*What role do police play within Marxist Socialism?

Within the field of [[sociological theory]], Marxist sociology is recognized as one of the major [[sociological paradigm]]s and is associated with conflict theory and critical theory. Unlike [[Marxism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]], Marxist sociology has put relatively little weight on creating [[class revolution]],&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; pursuing instead the development of an objective, [[Political economy|politico-economic]] study of society rather than a critical philosophy of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; It may be seen as a field of [[economic sociology]].

== Historical development ==
{{hatnote|References for this section:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictbot"&gt;Tom B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist thought'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1991 (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-631-18082-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4QwNP_K1pYC&amp;pg=PA506 p. 505-08 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. Much of the development in the field of Marxist sociology occurred on the outskirts of academia, pitting Marxist against "[[bourgeois]]" sociology.

For a while, this division was reinforced by the Marxism-inspired [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], which led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]]; soon, however, sociology found itself a victim of the [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union#Sociology|suppression of "bourgeois" science]] in the communist states. While, after several decades, sociology was reestablished in communist states, two separate currents of thought evolved within Marxist sociology: [[Soviet Marxism]], developed in the communist states (primarily the [[Soviet Union]]) of the 20th century, serving the state's interests and significantly crippled by forced adherence to the [[dogma]] of [[historical materialism]]; and the more independent school centered on the studies of Marxism in [[Western world|the West]]. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]].

Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see, for example, [[Sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see, for example, [[Sociology in China]]).

'''Mes Aynak''' ([[Pashto]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|ps|مس عينک}}, meaning "little source of copper"), also called '''Mis Ainak''' or '''Mis-e-Ainak''', is a site {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], located in a barren region of [[Logar Province]]. Mes Aynak contains Afghanistan's largest [[copper]] deposit, as well as the remains of an ancient settlement with over 400 Buddha statues, [[stupa]]s and a {{convert|40|ha|abbr=on|-1}} monastery complex. Archaeologists are only beginning to find remnants of an older 5,000-year-old [[Bronze Age]] site beneath the Buddhist level, including an [[Smelting#Copper and bronze|ancient copper smelter]].

The site of Mes Aynak possesses a vast complex of Buddhist monasteries, homes, and market areas.  The site contains artifacts recovered from the Bronze Age, and some of the artifacts recovered have dated back over three thousand years. The site's orientation on the [[Silk Road]] has yielded a mixture of elements from China and India. The wealth of Mes Aynak’s residents has been well represented in the site's far-reaching size and well guarded perimeter. Afghanistan’s eagerness to unearth the copper below the site is leading to the site's destruction rather than its preservation. Archaeologists have photographed the site and the relics excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rescuing Mes Aynak - Photo Gallery|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/norfolk-photography|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Mes Aynak'' ({{lang|ps|مس عينک}}) literally means "little source of copper"; ''mis'' ({{lang|fa|مس}}) is "copper", while ''aynak'' ({{lang|ps|عينک}}) is a [[diminutive]] form of ''ayn'' ({{lang|ar|عين}}), which means "source".

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:Statue of standing bodhisattva, schist, Mes Aynak, 3rd-6th century CE.165042.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Statue of the Buddha, Mes Aynak, 3rd-6th century CE.]]
As the name suggests, the presence of copper at Mes Aynak has been known about for some time, while the site's archaeological wealth has been known about since exploration by Russian and Afghan geologists in 1973-4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/afghanminerals/docs/tenders/Aynak/PartI_Aynak_Information_Package.pdf Aynak Information Package], Afghanistan Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Buddhist remains date from the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] era, although these gradually gave way to [[Tang Empire|T'ang Chinese]] and [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur]] influences. Mes Aynak was at the peak of its prosperity between the fifth and seventh century AD. A period of slow decline began in the eighth century, and the settlement was finally abandoned 200 years later.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1"&gt;Dalrymple, William (31 May 2013) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/31/mes-aynak-afghanistan-buddhist-treasure Mes Aynak: Afghanistan's Buddhist buried treasure faces destruction] guardian.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining lease==
{{see also|Mining in Afghanistan}}
In November 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the copper mine to the [[China Metallurgical Group]] (MCC) for US$3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Martin (April 2010) [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Race+to+save+Buddhist+relics+in+former+Bin+Laden+camp/23443 Race to save Buddhist relics in former Bin Laden camp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228082611/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Race+to+save+Buddhist+relics+in+former+Bin+Laden+camp/23443 |date=28 February 2012 }} theartnewspaper.com&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations have persisted that the then-minister of mines obstructed the contracting process and accepted a large bribe to eliminate the other companies involved in the bid.

The Afghan Mining Ministry estimates that the mine holds some six million tons of copper (5.52 million metric tons). The mine is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars, and to generate jobs and economic activity for the country, but threatens the site's archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Heidi (14 November 2010) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/14/chinese-copper-mine-afghanistan-mes-aynak-_n_783315.html Chinese Copper Mine In Afghanistan Threatens 2,600-Year-Old Buddhist Monastery] The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Brent (17 May 2012)[http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/are-chinese-miners-destroying-2000-year-old-buddhist-site-afghanistan-images Are Chinese Miners Destroying a 2,000-Year-Old Buddhist Site in Afghanistan?] http://asiasociety.org&lt;/ref&gt; The site is accessed via a {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} motorable track from the surfaced road between Kabul and [[Gardez]].&lt;ref name=bgs1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/afghanminerals/docs/tenders/Aynak/PartI_Aynak_Information_Package.pdf | title=Aynak Information Package Part I Introduction |publisher= Afghanistan Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mining lease holders propose to build a [[railway]] to serve the copper mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/agreement-signed-for-north-south-corridor.html | title=Agreement signed for north-south corridor | date=23 September 2010 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2012, MCC has not developed an environmental impact plan, and has remained secretive about [[Mining feasibility study|feasibility studies]], and the plan regarding the opening and closing of the mine, as well as any guarantees contained in the [[contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Benard, Dr Cheryl (4 July 2012) [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/04/afghanistan-s-mineral-wealth-could-be-a-bonanza-or-lead-to-disaster.html Afghanistan’s Mineral Wealth Could Be a Bonanza—or Lead to Disaster] thedailybeast.com&lt;/ref&gt; International experts have warned that the project, and other similar projects in Afghanistan, could be threatened because MCC has not fulfilled promises made to the Afghan government, such as the lack of provision of proper housing for relocated villagers. Other investments that have yet to be fulfilled include a railway, a 400-megawatt power plant and a coal mine.&lt;ref name=nissenbaum&gt;Nissenbaum, Dion (14 June 2012) [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/afghanistan-mining-wealth-thwarted-by-delays/story-fnay3ubk-1226395155692 Afghanistan mining wealth thwarted by delays] The Australian, theaustralian.com&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Global Witness]], an independent advocacy group that focuses on natural resource exploitation, said there was a "major gap" between the government's promises of transparency and its follow-through.&lt;ref name=nissenbaum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(24 April 2012)[http://www.globalwitness.org/library/future-afghan-mining-sector-threatened-weak-contracts Future of Afghan mining sector threatened by weak contracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological work==
[[File:Mes Aynak stupa.jpg|thumb|Newly excavated Buddhist [[stupa]].]]
[[File:Mes Aynak archeologists camp.jpg|right|thumb|The archeologists' camp sits beneath a monastery.]] [[File:Mes Aynak archeologists.jpg|right|thumb|Archeologists excavating the monasteries.]]
Archaeologists believe that Mes Aynak is a major historical heritage site. It has been called "one of the most important points along the [[Silk Road]]" by French archaeologist, Philippe Marquis.&lt;ref&gt;(15 November 2010) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1329650/Company-digging-Afghanistan-unearths-2-600-year-old-Buddhist-monastery.html Copper load of this! Company digging mine in Afghanistan unearths 2,600-year-old Buddhist monastery] Dailymail.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There are thought to be 19 separate archaeological sites in the valley including two small forts, a citadel, four fortified monasteries, several Buddhist stupas and a [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]], as well as ancient copper workings, smelting workshops, a [[Mint (coin)|mint]], and miners habitations.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt; In addition to the Buddhist monasteries and other structures from the Buddhist era that have already been identified, Mes Aynak also holds the remains of prior civilizations likely going back as far as the 3rd century BC. Historians are particularly excited by the prospect of learning more about the early science of metallurgy and mining by exploring this site. It is known to contain coins, glass, and the tools for making these, going back thousands of years. 

All of this historical material is in imminent danger of destruction by the mining endeavor. In response to negative reports in the press comparing the Chinese mining company to those who destroyed the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], a plan for minimal [[archaeological excavation]] was put in place. This plan still foresees the destruction of the site and everything still buried beneath it, but it does allow for the removal of whatever artifacts can be carried away by a small archaeological team led by DAFA, the French archaeological mission to Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Rescue excavations===
Between May 2010 and July 2011 archaeologists excavated approximately 400 items; more than what the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] housed before the war. The site covers roughly {{convert|400000|m2}}, encompassing several separate monasteries and a commercial area. It appears that Buddhists who began settling the area almost two millennia ago were drawn by the availability of copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Baker | first = Aryn | title = Deciding Between Heritage and Hard Cash in Afghanistan | url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2099676,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 20 August 2012 | date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a stone statue, or [[stele]], found in 2010 has been identified as a depiction of Prince Siddhartha before he founded Buddhism and has been taken to support the idea that there was an ancient monastic [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] dedicated to  Siddhartha's pre-enlightenment life.&lt;ref&gt;Jarus, Owen (6 June 2012) [http://www.livescience.com/20799-ancient-statue-reveals-prince-buddha.html Ancient Statue Reveals Prince Who Would Become Buddha] livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, a conference of experts in the fields of geology, mining engineering, archaeology, history and economic development met at [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|SAIS]] in Washington, D.C to assess the situation in Mes Aynak. The provisional findings were tentatively encouraging: because of the length of time before mining can actually start at the site (approximately five years), it is indeed possible for collaboration between archaeologists and mining engineers to work to save Mes Aynak's cultural treasures. The site could either become a positive model for mineral extraction working to preserve cultural heritage or become an irreparable failure. However, a number of measures, that are not currently in place, must be met first. The site is still scheduled for destruction in January 2013.&lt;ref name=ARCH&gt;[http://www.archinternational.org/mes_aynak.html Experts Show How to Preserve Ancient Mes Aynak Ruins While Safely Mining Copper Near Kabul, Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629011855/http://archinternational.org/mes_aynak.html |date=29 June 2012 }} ARCH International, archinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient site needs saving not destroying|last=Huffman|first=Brent|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/22/opinion/afghanistan-buddha-site-mine/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavators at Mes Aynak have been denounced as "promoting Buddhism" and threatened by the Taliban and many of the Afghan excavators who are working for purely financial reasons don't feel any connection to the Buddhist artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloch  |first=Hannah |date=September 2015 |title=Mega Copper Deal in Afghanistan Fuels Rush to Save Ancient Treasures |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/bloch-text |journal=National Geographic |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
The [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]] has provided a million dollars of U.S. military funding to help save the Buddhist ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Global Heritage Fund blog article (July 2012) [http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/aynak_documentary GHF Supports Buddhas of Aynak Documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726062047/http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/aynak_documentary |date=26 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2013 there is an international team of 67 archaeologists on site, including French, English, Afghans and Tajiks. There are also approximately 550 local labourers, which is set to increase to 650 in the summer. When this occurs Mes Aynak will become "the largest rescue dig anywhere in the world".&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt; All these personnel are protected by 200 armed guards. The team are using [[ground-penetrating radar]], [[Orthophoto|georectified photography]] and aerial 3D images to produce a comprehensive digital map of the ruins.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt;

The rescue work was continuing as of June 2014, in spite of difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rescuing Mes Aynak|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/bloch-text|accessdate = 2015-08-19|first = Hannah|last = Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only 10 international experts working at the site, and fewer than 20 Afghan archaeologists from Kabul’s Institute of Archaeology. A team of seven Tajik archaeologists was also helping. Marek Lemiesz, a senior archaeologist at the site, said that more help was needed. Security was also a concern.&lt;ref&gt;24 June 2014, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/24/mes-aynak-savingafghanistansculturaltreasures.html Saving Buddhist statues: Afghanistan’s big dig] america.aljazeera.com&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also indications that mining plans were being delayed because of the declining copper prices.

A documentary titled ''[[Saving Mes Aynak]]'',&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1302159--afghanistan-archeological-site-in-a-race-for-survival|title=Afghanistan archeological site in a race for survival|last=Ward|first=Olivia|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Brent E. Huffman, tells the story of the archaeological site, as well as the dangerous environment the mine has created for archaeologists, Chinese workers, and local Afghans. The film follows several main characters, including Philippe Marquis, a French archaeologist leading emergency conservation efforts; Abdul Qadeer Temore, an Afghan archaeologist at the Afghan National Institute of Archaeology; Liu Wenming, a manager for the [[China Metallurgical Group Corporation]]; and Laura Tedesco, an American archaeologist working for the [[U.S. State Department]].

In July 2014 it was announced that ''Saving Mes Aynak'' will be completed by the end of 2014, and is being made with [[Kartemquin Films]].&lt;ref name="Kartemquin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kartemquin.com/news/saving-mes-aynak-comes-to-kartemquin|title=Saving Mes Aynak comes to Kartemquin|publisher=[[Kartemquin Films]]|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Saving Mes Aynak'' premiered at the 2014 [[IDFA film festival]] in Amsterdam and in the USA at the 2015 [[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]].

In April 2015, Brent E. Huffman announced a plan to raise awareness of Mes Aynak through a #SaveMesAynak Global Screening Day and a fundraising campaign.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/saving-mes-aynak-documentary-campaign-indiegogo-1201480311/|title=Filmmakers Launch ‘Saving Mes Aynak’ Campaign for Afghan Archaeological Site|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=26 April 2015|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microbiology of decomposition''' is the study of all microorganisms (mainly [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) involved in [[decomposition]], the chemical and physical processes during which organic matter is broken down and reduced to its original elements.

Decomposition microbiology can be divided between two fields of interest:
# decomposition of [[plant]] materials;
# decomposition of [[cadavers]] and carcasses.

The decomposition of plant materials is commonly studied in order to understand the [[Carbon cycle|cycling of carbon]] within a given environment and to understand the subsequent impacts on soil quality. Plant material decomposition is also often referred to as composting. The decomposition of cadavers and carcasses has become an important field of study within forensic [[taphonomy]].

==Decomposition microbiology of plant materials==

{{See also|compost}}
 
The breakdown of vegetation is highly dependent on oxygen and moisture levels. During decomposition, microorganisms require oxygen for their respiration. If anaerobic conditions dominate the decomposition environment, microbial activity will be slow and thus decomposition will be slow.  Appropriate moisture levels are required for microorganisms to proliferate and to actively decompose organic matter. In arid environments, bacteria and fungi dry out and are unable to take part in decomposition. In wet environments, anaerobic conditions will develop and decomposition can also be considerably slowed down. Decomposing microorganisms also require the appropriate plant substrates in order to achieve good levels of decomposition. This usually translates to having appropriate carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N). The ideal composting carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is thought to be approximately 30:1. As in any microbial process, the decomposition of plant litter by microorganisms will also be dependent on temperature. For example, leaves on the ground will not undergo decomposition during the winter months where snow cover occurs as temperatures are too low to sustain microbial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKinley |first1=V.L. |last2=Vestal |first2=J.R. |last3=Eralp |first3=A.E. |year=1985 |title=Microbial activity in composting |journal=BioCycle |publisher= |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=47–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition microbiology of cadavers and carcasses==

The decomposition processes of cadavers and carcasses are studied within the field of forensic taphonomy in order to:
*aid in the estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI) or time since death;
*aid in the location of potential clandestine graves.

Decomposition microbiology as applied to forensic taphonomy can be divided into 2 groups of studies:
* microorganisms from within the body;
* microorganisms from the decomposition environment.

===Microorganisms in the body===

When considering cadavers and carcasses, [[putrefaction]] is the proliferation of microorganisms within the body following death and also encompasses the breakdown of tissues brought upon by the growth of bacteria. The first signs of putrefaction are usually the discolorations of the body which can vary between shades of green, blue, red or black depending on 1) where the color changes are observed and 2) how far along within the decomposition process the observation is made. This phenomenon is known as marbling. Discolorations are the results of bile pigments being released following an enzymatic attack of the [[liver]], [[gallbladder]] and [[pancreas]] and the release of hemoglobin breakdown products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-King | first= Harrell |editor-first= William D.| editor-last=Hagldund |title= Forensic Taphonomy: The post-mortem fate of human remains |publisher=CRC Press |year=1997 |pages=93–108 |chapter=Chapter Chemical and Ultrastructural Aspects of Decomposition |isbn= 978-0-8493-9434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proliferation of bacteria throughout the body is accompanied with the production of considerable amounts of gases due to their capacities of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vass|first1=A.A.|last2=Barschik|first2=S.A.|last3=Sega|first3=G.|last4=Caton|first4=J.|last5=Skeen|first5=J.T.|last6=Love|first6=J.C.|year=2002|title=Decomposition chemistry of human remains: a new methodology for determining post-mortem interval|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|volume=47|issue=3|pages=542–553|url= http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0022-1198&amp;site=1|doi= 10.1520/JFS15294J|pmid=12051334}}&lt;/ref&gt; As gases accumulate within the bodily cavities the body appears to swell as it enters the bloat stage of decomposition.

As oxygen is present within a body at the beginning of decomposition, [[aerobic organism|aerobic bacteria]] flourish during the first stages of the process. As the microbial population increases, an accumulation of gases changes the environment into anaerobic conditions which is consequently followed by a change to [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are thought to be responsible for the majority of the putrefactive processes that occur in cadavers and carcasses. This can be in part attributed to the impressive concentrations of viable gastro-intestinal organisms and the metabolic capacities they possess allowing them to use an array of different nutrient sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson|first=Michael|title= Microbial inhabitants of humans: their ecology and role in health and disease|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn= 0-521-84158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are also capable of migrating from the gut to any other region of the body by using the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, we know that coliform varieties of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' are important members of the aerobic putrefactive bacteria and that members of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]'' make up a large part of anaerobic putrefactive bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Microo scheme.jpg|thumb|center|frame| Proposed evolution of microorganisms within the body during decomposition. As oxygen is available at the beginning of decomposition, aerobic microorganisms flourish and quickly deplete the oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can then proliferate in the body. Later in the decomposition process, fungi and bacteria from the environment will also become involved in the process.]]

===Microorganisms outside the body===

Cadavers and carcasses are usually left to decompose in contact with soil whether through burial in a grave or if left to decompose on the soil surface. This allows microorganisms in the soil and air to come in contact with the body and to take part in the decomposition process. Soil microorganism communities also undergo changes as a result of decomposition fluids leaching in the environment. Cadavers and carcasses often show signs of fungal growth suggesting that fungi use the body as a source of nutrients.

The exact impacts that decomposition may have on surrounding soil microbial communities remains unclear as some studies have shown increases in microbial biomass following decomposition whereas other have seen decreases. It is likely that the survival of microorganisms throughout the decomposition process is highly dependent of a multitude of environmental factors including pH, temperature and moisture.      [[File:Example of a pig carcass in the dry decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|Frame|Right|Skeletonized pig carcass showing the production of a cadaver decomposition island surrounding the remains as a result of leaching of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment.]]

====Decomposition fluids and soil microbiology====

Decomposition fluids entering the soil represent an important influx of organic matter and can also contain a large microbial load of organisms from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putman|first1=R.J.|year=1978|title= Flow of energy and organic matter from a carcase during decomposition: Decomposition of small mammal carrion in temperate systems 2|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|volume=31|issue=1|pages=58–68|jstor=3543384|doi=10.2307/3543384|journal=Oikos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area where the majority of the decomposition fluid leaches into the soil is often referred to as a cadaver decomposition island (CDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter|first1= D.O.|last2=Yellowlees|first2=D.|last3=Tibbett|first3=M.|year=2006|title= Cadaver decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems| journal= Naturwissenschaften |publisher= Springer|volume=94|pages= 12–24|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8021xqt7667w264/|doi= 10.1007/s00114-006-0159-1|pmid=17091303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that decomposition can have a favorable influence on the growth of plants due to increased fertility, a useful tool when trying to locate clandestine graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hunter |first1= John |last2= Cox |first2=Margaret |title= Forensic archaeology: advances in theory and practice |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-27312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the concentration of nutrients can have lasting effects that are still seen years after a body or carcass has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Towne |first1= E.G. |year=2000 |title= Prairie vegetation and soil nutrient response to ungulate carcasses |publisher= Springer |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages= 232–239 |doi= 10.1007/PL00008851 |jstor=4222536 |journal=Oecologia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence that the surge in nutrients can have on the microorganisms and vegetation of a given site is not well understood but it appears that decomposition initially has an inhibitory effect for an initial stage before entering a second stage of increased growth.

====Decomposition fungi====

{{See also|detritivore|decomposer|decomposition}}

[[File:Fungihoof.JPG|right|frame| Fungal mycelia (white) on hoof of a deceased pig|412x412px]] It is well known that fungi are heterotrophic for carbon compounds and almost all other nutrients they require. They must obtain these through saprophytic or parasitic associations with their hosts which implicates them in many decomposition processes.

Two major groups of fungi have been identified as being linked to cadaver decomposition: 
* [[ammonia fungi]]
* post-putrefactive fungi

Ammonia fungi are broken-down into two groups referred to as "early stage fungi" and "late stage fungi." Such a classification is possible due to the successions that are observed between the types of fungi that fruit in or around a burial environment. The progression between the two groups occurs following the release of nitrogenous products from a body in decomposition.  Early stage fungi are described as being [[ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[fungi imperfecti|deuteromycetes]] and saprophytic [[basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]] whereas late stage fungi consisted of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1= David O. |last2=Tibbett |first2=Mark |year=2003 |title= Taphonomic mycota: Fungi with forensic potential |journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=Blackwell |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=168–171 |url=http://enterprise.astm.org.uproxy.library.dc-uoit.ca/SUBSCRIPTION/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/JFS2002169.htm |doi=10.1520/JFS2002169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Decomposition fungi as PMI estimators=====

Considering the amount of forensic cases in which significant amounts of mycelia are observed is quite high, investigating cadaver associated mycota may prove valuable to the scientific community as they have much forensic potential.

Only one attempt at using fungi as a PMI marker in a forensic case has been published to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hitosugi |first1= Masahito |last2=Ishii |first2=Kiyoshi |last3=Yaguchi |first3=Takashi |last4=Chigusa |first4=Yuichi |last5=Kurosu |first5=Akira |last6=Kido |first6=Masahito |last7=Nagai |first7=Toshiaki |last8=Tokudome |first8=Shogo |title= Fungi can be a useful forensic tool |journal= Legal medicine |publisher=Elsevier |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 240–242 |url=http://www.legalmedicinejournal.com/article/S1344-6223%2806%2900052-6/abstract | doi = 10.1016/j.legalmed.2006.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported the presence of two types of fungi (''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'') on a body found in a well in Japan and stated that they could estimate PMI as being approximately ten days based on the known growth cycles of the fungi in question.

The causes and effects of municipally owned corporations are posited to be different from those of [[state-owned enterprises]].

Under [[New Public Management]], [[corporatization]] became prominent as a step towards (partial) [[privatization]].&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1527533|title=Debate: Corporatization as more than a recent crisis-driven development|last=Voorn, Bart, Sandra Van Thiel, and Marieke van Genugten (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became an end in itself, aiming to combine government control with efficient, businesslike service delivery that was considered lacking in bureaucratic service delivery. The [[state-owned enterprise]]s that resulted were to be organized akin to private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain state ownership are not traded on the [[stock market]].&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Marra2/publication/4732914_Internal_Regulation_by_Mixed_Enterprises_The_Case_of_the_Italian_Water_Sector/links/0deec529a2526c7663000000/Internal-Regulation-by-Mixed-Enterprises-The-Case-of-the-Italian-Water-Sector.pdf|title=Internal regulation by mixed enterprises: the case of the Italian water sector|last=Marra, Alessandro (2007)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 78(2): 245-275.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also became a trend at the local level. Municipal corporation followed a process of [[externalization]] that required new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and followed common changes in the institutional landscape of [[public services]].&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossi, Giuseppe, and Christoph Reichard (2008)|title=Municipal corporatization in Germany and Italy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030802264275|publisher=Public Management Review, 10(5): 597-617}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a substantial growth in the number of municipally owned corporations in the 1990s and 2000s throughout Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1486629|title=New development: Corporatization of local authorities in England in the wake of austerity 2010–2016|last=Ferry, Laurence, Rhys Andrews, Chris Skelcher, and Piotr Wegorowski (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorioFecher2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/blaannpce/v_3a82_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a361-373.htm|title=The future of public enterprises: Contributions to a new discourse|last=Florio, Massimo, and Fabienne Fecher (2011)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 82(4): 361-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons and effects ==
Municipal corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes) or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. Its reasons and effects are somewhat similar as those of [[corporatization]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferryetal /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares&gt;{{cite web|last=António F. Tavares (2017)|title=Ten years after: revisiting the determinants of the adoption of municipal corporations for local service delivery|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1356723|publisher=Local Government Studies, 43(5): 697-706.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt; Such externalization gives the service delivery organization legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, because it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, it can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy also reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; At the local level there may also be higher transaction costs, because contracting capacity may be lower.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown, Trevor, and Matthew Potoski (2003)|title=Transaction Costs and Institutional Explanations for Government Service Production Decisions|url=http://spa.hust.edu.cn/2008/uploadfile/2009-9/20090910194210575.pdf|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Once a service has been corporatised, it is often relatively easy to (partially) privatise it by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Thus corporatisation can be a stop on the way towards (partial) privatization.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of [[hybrid organization|hybrid]] forms of organization, such as institutional private-partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations, which are especially relevant at the local level because of opportunities to capture scale economies.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;

=== Alleviating fiscal stress ===
Municipal corporations tend to be established by local governments experiencing some degree of fiscal stress.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citroni&gt;{{cite web|last=Citroni, Giulio, Andrea Lippi, and Stefania Profeti (2013)|title=Remapping the State: Inter-Municipal Cooperation through Corporatisation and Public-Private Governance Structures|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03003930.2012.707615|publisher=Local Government Studies, 39(2): 208-234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen, Rune J. (2007)|title=Does dispersed public ownership impair efficiency? The case of refuse collection in Norway|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.5414&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Public Administration,85(4): 1045-1058.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization was a way to allow local governments to "hide their liabilities by allocating them partly to their companies" or "corporatized their utilities (…) to raise new sources of income from their companies."&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;

== Problems with multiple ownership ==
The frequent ownership of municipally owned corporations by multiple municipalities can cause problems, the so-called 'multiple principal problem', that can lead these to be inefficient&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt; or have high failure rates.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; There can be free-riding or duplication in steering and monitoring procedures, resulting in high costs. If there is heterogeneity in interests between the multiple municipalities, there may be directive ambiguity or lobbying of the corporations by individual municipalities, leading to high inefficiency. Delegating governance to one elected party may be a way to solve this problem.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

== Usage ==
Municipal corporatization is more prominent for some services than for others. It is typically prominent in:&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

'''The National Institute for Trial Advocacy''' (referred to as "NITA") is a not for profit organization that was initially formed in 1969 in an effort to provide lawyers with better trial skills training, and was spurred on by criticisms within the judicial system of the apparent lack of trial preparation occurring within law schools. This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and came to the conclusion that [[Experiential learning|learning-by-doing]] trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/page.asp?id=7&amp;catid=32&amp;prodid=362 NITA Web Site | Building Trial Skills: National Session&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public service trial training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24768">'''Neo-Riemannian theory''' is a loose collection of ideas present in the writings of [[music theory|music theorists]] such as [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, [[Richard Cohn]], and [[Henry Klumpenhouwer]]. What binds these ideas is a central commitment to relating [[harmony|harmonies]] directly to each other, without necessary reference to a [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. Initially, those harmonies were [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor triads]]; subsequently, neo-Riemannian theory was extended to standard [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] sonorities as well. Harmonic proximity is characteristically gauged by efficiency of [[voice leading]]. Thus, C major and E minor triads are close by virtue of requiring only a single [[semitone|semitonal]] shift to move from one to the other. Motion between proximate harmonies is described by simple transformations. For example, motion between a C major and E minor triad, in either direction, is executed by an "L" transformation. Extended progressions of harmonies are characteristically displayed on a geometric plane, or map, which portrays the entire system of harmonic relations. Where consensus is lacking is on the question of what is most central to the theory: smooth voice leading, transformations, or the system of relations that is mapped by the geometries. The theory is often invoked when analyzing harmonic practices within the [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era .281850-1910.29|Late Romantic]] period characterized by a high degree of [[chromaticism]], including work of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]].&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Autumn 1998 |title=An Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and Historical Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=167–180 |jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minor as upside down major.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Riemann's 'dualist' system: minor as upside down major.]]

Neo-Riemannian theory is named after [[Hugo Riemann]] (1849–1919), whose "dualist" system for relating triads was adapted from earlier 19th-century harmonic theorists. (The term "[[harmonic dualism|dualism]]" refers to the emphasis on the inversional relationship between major and minor, with minor triads being considered "upside down" versions of major triads; this "dualism" is what produces the change-in-direction described above. See also: [[Utonality]]) In the 1880s, Riemann proposed a system of transformations that related triads directly to each other &lt;ref name="Klumpenhouwer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Klumpenhouwer |first=Henry |date=1994 |title=Some Remarks on the Use of Riemann Transformations |url=http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.94.0.9/mto.94.0.9.klumpenhouwer.art |journal=[[Music Theory Online]] |volume=0 |issue=9 |issn=1067-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of this aspect of Riemann's writings, independently of the dualist premises under which they were initially conceived, originated with [[David Lewin]] (1933–2003), particularly in his article "Amfortas's Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in Parsifal" (1984) and his influential book, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations'' (1987). Subsequent development in the 1990s and 2000s has expanded the scope of neo-Riemannian theory considerably, with further mathematical systematization to its basic tenets, as well as inroads into 20th century repertoires and music psychology.&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro" /&gt;

==Triadic transformations and voice leading==

The principal transformations of neo-Riemannian triadic theory connect triads of different species (major and minor), and are their own [[inversion (music)|inverses]] (a second application undoes the first). These transformations are purely harmonic, and do not need any particular voice leading between chords: all instances of motion from a C major to a C minor triad represent the same neo-Riemannian transformation, no matter how the voices are distributed in register.

The three transformations move one of the three notes of the triad to produce a different triad:
*The '''P''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Parallel key|Parallel]]. In a Major Triad move the third down a semitone (C major to C minor), in a Minor Triad move the third up a semitone (C minor to C major)
*The '''R''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Relative key|Relative]]. In a Major Triad move the fifth up a tone (C major to A minor), in a Minor Triad move the root down a tone (A minor to C major)
*The '''L''' transformation exchanges a triad for its Leading-Tone Exchange. In a Major Triad the root moves down by a semitone (C major to E minor), in a Minor Triad the fifth moves up by a semitone (E minor to C major)

Observe that '''P''' preserves the ''perfect fifth'' interval (so given say C and G there are only two candidates for the third note: E and E{{flat}}), '''L''' preserves the ''minor third'' interval (given E and G our candidates are C and B) and '''R''' preserves the ''major third'' interval (given C and E our candidates are G and A).

Secondary operations can be constructed by combining these basic operations:

*The '''N''' (or ''Nebenverwandt'') relation exchanges a major triad for its minor [[subdominant]], and a minor triad for its major [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (C major and F minor). The "N" transformation can be obtained by applying R, L, and P successively.&lt;ref name="Cohn Weitzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Spring 2000 |title=Weitzmann's Regions, My Cycles, and Douthett's Dancing Cubes |journal=[[Music Theory Spectrum]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1525/mts.2000.22.1.02a00040 |jstor=745854 |via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''S''' (or ''Slide'') relation exchanges two triads that share a third (C major and C{{sharp}} minor); it can be obtained by applying L, P, and R successively in that order.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations |last=Lewin |first=David |date=1987 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780199759941 |location=New Haven, CT |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''H''' relation (LPL) exchanges a triad for its hexatonic pole (C major and A{{flat}} minor)&lt;ref name="Cohn Hexatonic"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Summer 2004 |title=Uncanny Resemblances: Tonal Signification in the Freudian Age |journal=[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=285–323 |doi=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285|jstor=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any combination of the L, P, and R transformations will act inversely on major and minor triads: for instance, R-then-P transposes C major down a minor third, to A major via A minor, whilst transposing C minor to E{{flat}} minor up a minor 3rd via E{{flat}} major.

Initial work in neo-Riemannian theory treated these transformations in a largely harmonic manner, without explicit attention to voice leading. Later, Cohn pointed out that neo-Riemannian concepts arise naturally when thinking about certain problems in voice leading.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=27 November 2008 |title=Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading |url=https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/scalesarrays.pdf |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2249.2008.00257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two triads (major or minor) share two common tones and can be connected by stepwise voice leading the third voice if and only if they are linked by one of the L, P, R transformations described above.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt; (This property of stepwise voice leading in a single voice is called [[voice-leading]] [[Occam's razor|parsimony]].) Note that here the emphasis on inversional relationships arises naturally, as a byproduct of interest in "parsimonious" voice leading, rather than being a fundamental theoretical postulate, as it was in Riemann's work.

More recently, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] has argued that the connection between neo-Riemannian operations and voice leading is only approximate (see below).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mathematics and Computation in Music |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-02394-1 |editor-last=Chew |editor-first=Elaine |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=38 |location=Heidelberg |pages=258–273 |chapter=Three Conceptions of Musical Distance |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |editor-last2=Childs |editor-first2=Adrian |editor-last3=Chuan |editor-first3=Ching-Hua |chapter-url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/distance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the formalism of neo-Riemannian theory treats voice leading in a somewhat oblique manner: "neo-Riemannian transformations," as defined above, are purely harmonic relationships that do not necessarily involve any particular mapping between the chords' notes.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;

== Graphical representations ==
[[File:Neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.svg|thumb|500px|Pitches in the Tonnetz are connected by lines if they are separated by minor third, major third, or perfect fifth. Interpreted as a torus the Tonnetz has 12 nodes (pitches) and 24 triangles (triads).]]

Neo-Riemannian transformations can be modeled with several interrelated geometric structures. The Riemannian [[Tonnetz]] ("tonal grid," shown on the right) is a planar array of pitches along three simplicial axes, corresponding to the three consonant intervals. Major and minor triads are represented by triangles which tile the plane of the Tonnetz. Edge-adjacent triads share two common pitches, and so the principal transformations are expressed as minimal motion of the Tonnetz. Unlike the historical theorist for which it is named, neo-Riemannian theory typically assumes enharmonic equivalence (G{{sharp}} = A{{flat}}), which wraps the planar graph into a [[torus]].

[[File:TonnetzTorus.gif|thumb|One toroidal view of the neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.]]

Alternate tonal geometries have been described in neo-Riemannian theory that isolate or expand upon certain features of the classical Tonnetz. [[Richard Cohn]] developed the Hyper [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] system to describe motion within and between separate major third cycles, all of which exhibit what he formulates as "maximal smoothness." (Cohn, 1996).&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=March 1996 |title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=9–40 |jstor=854168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geometric figure, Cube Dance, was invented by Jack Douthett; it features the geometric dual of the Tonnetz, where triads are vertices instead of triangles (Douthett and Steinbach, 1998) and are interspersed with augmented triads, allowing smoother voice-leadings.

Many of the geometrical representations associated with neo-Riemannian theory are unified into a more general framework by the continuous voice-leading spaces explored by Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. This work originates in 2004, when Callender described a continuous space in which points represented three-note "chord types" (such as "major triad"), using the space to model "continuous transformations" in which voices slid continuously from one note to another.&lt;ref name="Callender MTO"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |date=2004 |title=Continuous Transformations |journal=Music Theory Online |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Tymoczko showed that paths in Callender's space were isomorphic to certain classes of voice leadings (the "individually T related" voice leadings discussed in Tymoczko 2008) and developed a family of spaces more closely analogous to those of neo-Riemannian theory. In Tymoczko's spaces, points represent particular chords of any size (such as "C major") rather than more general chord types (such as "major triad").&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Geometry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=2006 |title=The Geometry of Musical Chords |url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |pages=72–74 |pmid=16825563 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073427/http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko together proposed a unified framework connecting these and many other geometrical spaces representing diverse range of music-theoretical properties.&lt;ref name="CQT"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |last2=Quinn |first2=Ian |last3=Tymoczko |first3=Dmitri |author-link3=Dmitri Tymoczko |title=Generalized Voice Leading Spaces |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=320 |pages=346–348|doi=10.1126/science.1153021|date=18 Apr 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Neo-Riemannian theorists often analyze chord progressions as combinations of the three basic LPR transformations, the only ones that preserve two common tones. 
Thus the progression from C major to E major might be analyzed as L-then-P, which is a 2-unit motion since it involves two transformations. (This same transformation sends C minor to A{{flat}} minor, since L of C minor is A{{flat}} major, while P of A{{flat}} major is A{{flat}} minor.) These distances reflect voice-leading only imperfectly.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; For example, according to strains of neo-Riemannian theory that prioritize common-tone preservation, the C major triad is closer to F major than to F minor, since C major can be transformed into F major by R-then-L, while it takes three moves to get from C major to F minor (R-then-L-then-P). However, from a chromatic voice-leading perspective F minor is closer to C major than F major is, since it takes just two semitones of motion to transform F minor into C major (A{{flat}}-&gt;G and F-&gt;E) whereas it takes three semitones to transform F major into C major. Thus LPR transformations are unable to account for the voice-leading efficiency of the IV-iv-I progression, one of the basic routines of nineteenth-century harmony.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; Note that similar points can be made about common tones: on the Tonnetz, F minor and E{{flat}} minor are both three steps from C major, even though F minor and C major have one common tone, while E{{flat}} minor and C major have none.

Underlying these discrepancies are different ideas about whether harmonic proximity is maximized when two common tones are shared, or when the total voice-leading distance is minimized. For example, in the R transformation, a single voice moves by whole step; in the N or S transformation, two voices move by semitone. When common-tone maximization is prioritized, R is more efficient; when voice-leading efficiency is measured by summing the motions of the individual voices, the transformations are equivalently efficient. Early neo-Riemannian theory conflated these two conceptions. More recent work has disentangled them, and measures distance unilaterally by voice-leading proximity independently of common-tone preservation. Accordingly, the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations becomes problematized. As early as 1992, Jack Douthett created an exact geometric model of inter-triadic voice-leading by interpolating augmented triads between R-related triads, which he called "Cube Dance".&lt;ref name="Douthett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douthett |first=Jack |last2=Steinbach |first2=Peter |date=1998 |title=Parsimonious Graphs: A Study in Parsimony, Contextual Transformation, and Modes of Limited Transposition |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=2314278 |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.2307/843877 |jstor=843877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Douthett's figure was published in 1998, its superiority as a model of voice leading was not fully appreciated until much later, in the wake of the geometrical work of Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko; indeed, the first detailed comparison of "Cube Dance" to the neo-Riemannian "Tonnetz" appeared in 2009, more than fifteen years after Douthett's initial discovery of his figure.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; In this line of research, the triadic transformations lose the foundational status that they held in the early phases of neo-Riemannian theory. The geometries to which voice-leading proximity give rise attain central status, and the transformations become heuristic labels for certain kinds of standard routines, rather than their defining property.

Nonetheless, among all possible sets of the twenty-four Riemannian triadic transformations, the length of combinations of members from the set of L, P, and R transformations better correlates with chromatic voice-leading distance than nearly every other set of transformations. For example, if only L and R transformations were used to measure transformational distance between triads, the number of contradictions between transformational distance and voice-leading distance like those examples above is much greater than when using L, P, and R. This partially restores some distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations.&lt;ref name="MurphyReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=S. |date=1 April 2014 |title=Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |language=en |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1215/00222909-2413598 |issn=0022-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

Beyond its application to triadic chord progressions, neo-Riemannian theory has inspired numerous subsequent investigations. These include

*Voice-leading proximity among chords with more than three tones- among species of [[hexachord]]s, such as the [[Mystic chord]] (Callender, 1998)&lt;ref name="Callender"&gt;Callender, Clifton, "Voice-Leading Parsimony in the Music of Alexander Scriabin", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 42/2 (1998), 219–233&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common-tone proximity among dissonant trichords &lt;ref name="Siciliano"&gt;Siciliano, Michael, "Toggling Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and Some Analysis of Early Atonal Music", ''Music Theory Specturm'' 27/2 (2005), 221–247&lt;/ref&gt;
*Progressions among triads within diatonic rather than chromatic space.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*Transformations among scales of various sizes and species (in the work of [[Dmitri Tymoczko]]).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Scales"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri. "Scale Networks and Debussy," ''Journal of Music Theory'' 48/2 (2004): : 215–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations among all possible triads, not necessarily strict mode-shifting [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] ([[Julian Hook|Hook]], 2002).&lt;ref name="Hook 1"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Uniform Triadic Transformations", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 46/1–2 (2002), 57–126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations between chords of differing cardinality, called ''cross-type transformations'' (Hook, 2007).&lt;ref name="Hook 2"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Cross-Type Transformations and the Path Consistency Condition", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[popular music|pop music]].&lt;ref name="Capuzzo"&gt;Capuzzo, Guy, "Neo-Riemannian Theory and the Analysis of Pop-Rock Music", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 26/2 2004), Pages 177–200&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[film music]].&lt;ref name="Murphy 1"&gt;Murphy, Scott, "The Major Tritone Progression in Recent Hollywood Science Fiction Films," ''Music Theory Online'' 12/2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehman"&gt;Lehman, Frank, "Transformational Analysis and the Representation of Genius in Film Music," ''Music Theory Spectrum'', 35/1 (2013), 1–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy 2"&gt;Murphy, Scott, "Transformational Theory and the Analysis of Film Music," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Film Music Studies'', ed. David Neumeyer, 471–499. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these extensions share neo-Riemannian theory's concern with non-traditional relations among familiar tonal chords; others apply voice-leading proximity or harmonic transformation to characteristically atonal chords.

The objective of the occupational toxicologist is to prevent adverse health effects in workers that arise from exposures in their work environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Casarett and Doull’s ,TOXICOLOGY, The Basic Science of Poisons&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of [[toxicology]] has many applications. One of these, relates to [[Radiant exposure|exposure]] of people to noxious or hazardous agents during the course of their work.

The work environment has played a significant role in the occurrence of adverse human health effects due to chemical and biological hazards for centuries. Occupational health specialists, including toxicologists, rely upon human and animal data to determine safe exposure levels. If effects observed in workers can be reproduced in a laboratory animal, it becomes possible to investigate the mechanisms that might reasonably be expected to produce such effects. On the other hand, shedding light on the mechanism by which a designated effect is produced in a test animal species may make it easier to find ways to prevent such effects from occurring in humans. Such an understanding may also help to identify subtle or delayed effects that have not been observed in workers, but to which health professionals should be alerted.&lt;ref&gt;PRINCIPLES OF TOXICOLOGY , Environmental and Industrial Applications , SECOND EDITION , Edited by Phillip L. Williams,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==
Occupational exposures involve situations ranging، for example from a secretary using typewriter correction fluid to the loading and off-loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline.

== History ==

Early writings by Ulrich Ellenbog (1435–1499), [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] (1494–1555), and [[Paracelsus]] (1492–1541) revealed the toxic nature of exposures in [[mining]], [[smelting]], and [[metallurgy]].
A systematic treatise by [[Ramazzini]] (1633–1714) described the hazards as they applied to miners, chemists, metal workers, [[Driver (series)|tanners]], [[pharmacists]], grain sifters, stonecutters, sewage workers, and even corpse bearers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==How is occupational toxicology used?==
*Role in decision making within hierarchical control
*Role in setting exposure standards for workplace chemicals
*Role in biological monitoring for chemical exposure&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Biological monitoring ==
The [[measurement]] of a chemical, its [[metabolite]], or a [[biochemical]] effect in a biologic [[Biological specimen|specimen]] for the purpose of assessing [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]. Biologic [[Biomonitoring|monitoring]] is an important [[tool]] to identify the nature and amount of chemical exposures in [[occupational]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;CURRENT Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine,fourth edition Edited by Joseph LaDou&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Heavy metals]]==
[[Metal]]s with a [[density]] of more than 5 g/cm3 and [[toxic]] effects.
Including [[arsenic]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[lithium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[thorium]], have documented ototoxic potential.
The metals represent a different aspect of toxicology in that they do not undergo breakdown to other metals (to do so would be transmutation of the elements, an old alchemical principle still not possible without huge sources of energy, and a particle accelerator!). The absorption, disposition and excretion of metals are largely dependent on physical factors, such as solubility, ionisation, particle size and chemical species (for metal salts). About 70–80 elements in the periodic table are considered metals. Groups Ia and IIa, the‘s block’ metals, form monovalent and divalent cations respectively. Groups IIIb to VIb constitute the ‘p block’ elements, which include metals that can have ions of different valencies. These are called the transition elements. Of the metal elements, about 40 are considered to be ‘common’ metals. However, less than 30 have compounds that have been reported to produce toxicity. Metals are probably some of the oldest toxicants known to humans. Health effects such as colic were reported following exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury over 2000 years ago. On the other hand, metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel belong to the modern era. The importance of some of the rarer metals may become apparent with emerging changes in technology, such as microelectronics and superconductors. The toxicity of a metal is only partially related to its position in the periodic table. Toxicity decreases with the stability of the configuration of electrons in the atomic nuclei. This produces a number of properties that can affect toxicity&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Thomas Benjamin Kennington - Orphans.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Orphans'' by [[Thomas Benjamin Kennington|Thomas Kennington]], [[oil on canvas]], 1885]]

An '''orphan''' (from the {{lang-el|ορφανός|orphanós}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rfano%2Fs ὀρφανός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who has lost either or both parents, whose parents are unknown, or have permanently abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orphan Merriam-Webster online dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 6th edition "a child bereaved of parents" with bereaved meaning (of death etc) deprived of a relation&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to animals, only the mother's condition is usually relevant (i.e. if the female parent has gone, the offspring is an orphan, regardless of the father's condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orphan?s=t |title=orphan |work=Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Various groups use different definitions to identify orphans. One legal definition used in the [[United States]] is a [[minor (law)|minor]] bereft through "death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/orphan USCIS definition for immigration purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common use, an orphan does not have any surviving parent to care for them. However, the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS]] (UNAIDS), and other groups label any child that has lost one parent as an orphan. In this approach, a ''maternal orphan'' is a child whose mother has died, a ''paternal orphan'' is a child whose father has died, and a ''double orphan'' is a child who has lost both parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp11_28_en.pdf UNAIDS Global Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with the older use of ''half-orphan'' to describe children that had lost only one parent.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/orphans/society-half-orphan-asylum.shtml this 19th-century news story] about The Society for the Relief of Half-Orphan and Destitute Children, or [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B00E1D9163AE033A25755C1A9649D94669FD7CF this one] about the Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Populations ==
[[Image:Girl in a Kabul orphanage, 01-07-2002.jpg|thumb|upright|An Afghan girl at a [[Kabul|Kabul, Afghanistan]] orphanage in January 2002]]
Orphans are relatively rare in developed countries, because most children can expect both of their parents to survive their childhood. Much higher numbers of orphans exist in war-torn nations such as Afghanistan.

==Notable orphans==
{{main article|List of orphans and foundlings}}
[[List of orphans and foundlings|Famous orphans]] include world leaders such as [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Andrew Jackson]]; the Hebrew prophet [[Moses]] and the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]; writers such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]; athletes such as [[Aaron Hernandez]] or [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. The American orphan [[Henry Darger]] portrayed the horrible conditions of his orphanage in his art work. Other notable orphans include entertainment greats such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Frances McDormand]], and innumerable fictional characters in literature and comics.

==History==
Wars and great epidemics, such as AIDS, have created many orphans. The [[Second World War]], with its massive numbers of deaths and population movements, created large numbers of orphans in many countries—with estimates for Europe ranging from 1,000,000 to 13,000,000. Judt (2006) estimates there were 9,000 orphaned children in Czechoslovakia, 60,000 in the Netherlands 300,000 in Poland and 200,000 in Yugoslavia, plus many more in the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;For a high estimate see I.C.B. Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds. ''The Oxford companion to World War II'' (1995) p 208; for lower Tony Judt, ''Postwar: a history of Europe since 1945'' (2006) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Ring36.jpg|right|thumb|Mime offers food to the young Siegfried, an orphan he is raising; Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
Orphaned characters are extremely common as literary protagonists, especially in [[children's literature|children's]] and [[fantasy literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 16, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of parents leaves the characters to pursue more interesting and adventurous lives, by freeing them from familial obligations and controls, and depriving them of more prosaic lives.  It creates characters that are self-contained and introspective and who strive for affection. Orphans can metaphorically search for self-understanding through attempting to know their roots.  Parents can also be allies and sources of aid for children, and removing the parents makes the character's difficulties more severe.  Parents, furthermore, can be irrelevant to the theme a writer is trying to develop, and orphaning the character frees the writer from the necessity to depict such an irrelevant relationship; if one parent-child relationship is important, removing the other parent prevents complicating the necessary relationship.  All these characteristics make orphans attractive characters for authors.

Orphans are common in fairy tales, such as most variants of ''[[Cinderella]]''.

A number of well-known authors have written books featuring orphans. Examples from classic literature include [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'', [[L. M. Montgomery]]'s ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', Thomas Hardy's ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Among more recent authors, [[A. J. Cronin]], [[Lemony Snicket]], [[Angelo F. Coniglio|A. F. Coniglio]], [[Roald Dahl]] and [[J. K. Rowling]], as well as some less well-known authors of famous orphans like [[Little Orphan Annie]] have used orphans as major characters. One recurring storyline has been the relationship that the orphan can have with an adult from outside their immediate family as seen in Lyle Kessler's play ''[[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]]''.

Orphans are especially common as characters in comic books. Almost all the most popular heroes are orphans: Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Robin, The Flash, Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Green Arrow were all orphaned. Orphans are also very common among villains: Bane, Catwoman, and Magneto are examples. Lex Luthor, Deadpool, and Carnage can also be included on this list, though they killed one or both of their parents. Supporting characters befriended by the heroes are also often orphans, including the [[Newsboy Legion]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].

==Cartoons==

All of the orphan children from the 1936 ''[[Color Classics|Color Classic]]'', ''[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]'' produced by [[Fleischer Studios]], were voiced by [[Mae Questel]].

==In religious texts==
Many religious texts, including the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]], contain the idea that helping and defending orphans is a very important and God-pleasing matter. The religious leaders [[Moses]] and [[Muhammad]] were orphaned as children. Several scriptural citations describe how orphans should be treated:

'''Bible'''

* "Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan." ([[Hebrew Bible]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:22)
* "Leave your orphans; I will protect their lives. Your widows too can trust in me." (Hebrew Bible, [[Jeremiah]] 49:11)
* "To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress." (Hebrew Bible, [[Psalms]] 10:18)
* "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." ([[New Testament]], James 1:27)

'''Qu'ran'''

* "And they feed, for the love of God, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive," - ([[The Quran]], The Human: 8)
* "Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness," (The Quran, The Morning Hours: 9)
* "Have you not seen those who deny the faith and the Day of Judgment? Those are people who drive orphans away harshly, and do not encourage feeding the indigent. So woe be upon those who do prayer but are neglectful of it or show it off out of vanity, and those who deny even small kindnesses to others." - (The Quran, Small Kindnesses: 1-7)
* "(Be good to) orphans and the very poor. And speak good words to people." (The Quran, The Heifer: 83) 
* "…They will ask you about the property of orphans. Say, 'Managing it in their best interests is best'. If you mix your property with theirs, they are your brothers…" (The Quran, The Heifer: 220)
* "Give orphans their property, and do not substitute bad things for good. Do not assimilate their property into your own. Doing that is a serious crime." (The Quran, The Women: 2)
* "Keep a close check on orphans until they reach a marriageable age, then if you perceive that they have sound judgement hand over their property to them..." (The Quran, The Women: 6)

==== Subfields, by linguistic structures studied ====
Sub-fields of structure-focused linguistics include:

* [[Phonetics]] – study of the physical properties of speech (or signed) production and perception
* [[Phonology]] – study of sounds (or signs) as discrete, abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] – study of internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* [[Syntax]] – study of how words combine to form grammatical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s
* [[Semantics]] – study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of sentences
* [[Pragmatics]] – study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]] – and the role played by context and nonlinguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* [[Discourse analysis]] – analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* [[Linguistic typology]] – comparative study of the similarities and differences between language structures in the world's languages.

==== Subfields, by nonlinguistic factors studied ====
* [[Applied linguistics]] – study of language-related issues applied in everyday life, notably language policies, planning, and education. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)
* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of natural as well as human-taught communication systems in animals, compared to human language.
* [[Clinical linguistics]] – application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology]].
* [[Computational linguistics]] – study of linguistic issues in a way that is 'computationally responsible', i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties implementations.
* [[Developmental linguistics]] – study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood.
* [[Evolutionary linguistics]] – study of the origin and subsequent development of language by the human species.
* [[Historical linguistics]] – study of language change over time. Also called diachronic linguistics.
* [[Language geography]] – study of the geographical distribution of languages and linguistic features.
* [[Neurolinguistics]] – study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication.

{{expert|date=December 2011}}
'''Pedology''' ('''paidology''', '''paedology''') is the study of children's behavior and development (as distinct from [[pedagogy]], the art or science of teaching, and [[pediatrics]], the field of medicine relating to children). 

The origins of this trend in [[psychology]] and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or "experimental pedagogic psychology", "experimental pedagogy", "experimental education". 

[[G. Stanley Hall]] (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern [[educational psychology]].  An American researcher, [[Oscar Chrisman]], proposed the term "pedology" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of [[natural sciences]]. In 1909 Professor [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] organized a Pedological Society in [[Lviv]], [[Austro-Hungary]] (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in [[Kraków]]. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], with attendants from 22 countries.

[[World War I]] (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. 

[[Bowie State University]] in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a Bachelor's Degree in pedology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology/ | title=Pedology Major| publisher= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318204420/http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology// | archive-date=18 March 2008 | accessdate=11 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 document from the university refers to "the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)".&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|work=Assessment Times|url=https://www.bowiestate.edu/files/resources/newsletter-fall-2014.pdf|publisher=Bowie State University|date=August 2014 | title=Faculty Spotlight: Behavioral, Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedology in the Soviet Union==
In [[Imperial Russia]] a prominent developer of the field was [[Aleksandr Petrovich Nechayev|Aleksandr Nechayev]] (Александр Петрович Нечаев) in [[St. Petersburg]], who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]]; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.

This science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the [[Soviet Union]]. A journal ''Pedologiya'' ("Педология") was issued.  [[Lev Vygotsky]] was one of its prominent supporters. 

While many works of pedologists were of considerable value, the approach was severely criticized for over-enthusiastic but poorly grounded approach of [[Test (student assessment)|testing]] for predicting a child's mental development, in addition to estimating its status. 

It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] "On Pedological Perversions in the [[Narkompros]] System" on July 4, 1936 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031/Russian_Federation_in_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_History_of_Psychology_Pt_1 | title=Russian Federation | archive-date=4 June 2018 | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Post-Impressionism''' (also spelled '''Postimpressionism''') is a predominantly French [[art movement]] that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of [[Fauvism]]. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cloisonnism]], [[Pont-Aven School]], and [[Synthetism]], along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by [[Paul Cézanne]] (known as father of Post-impressionism), [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Timeline, Post-Impressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Post-Impressionism'' was first used by art critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="brettell"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=v5TcYXGDeI8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22the+term+Post-impressionism%22,+%221906%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqYXYo8DMAhVLuhQKHROHBYAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20term%20Post-impressionism%22%2C%20%221906%22&amp;f=false Richard R. Brettell, ''Modern Art, 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al"&gt;Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, William C. Agee, ''The Advent of Modernism. Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918'', High Museum of Art, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Frank Rutter]] in a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]] published in ''Art News'', 15 October 1910, described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen&gt;Bullen, J. B. ''Post-impressionists in England'', p.37. Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00216-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-00216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition, ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', defining it as the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. 

Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. [[Georges Seurat]] and his followers concerned themselves with [[Pointillism]], the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. [[Paul Cézanne]] set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to "make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums".&lt;ref&gt;Huyghe, Rene: ''Impressionism''. (1973). Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books Inc., p. 222. {{OCLC|153804642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] experimented with [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated [[Pointillism]], which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer [[Impressionism]] in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cogniat, Raymond (1975). Pissarro. New York: Crown, pp. 69–72. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173&amp;section_id=T068997#skipToContent Caroline Boyle-Turner, ''Post-Impressionism, History and application of the term'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as [[Fauvism]] and [[Cubism]], breaking from Post-Impressionism.

[[Image:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''Portrait of [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'', 1886, [[Tate Gallery]] [[London]]]]
The term was used in 1906,&lt;ref name="brettell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al" /&gt; and again in 1910 by [[Roger Fry]] in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', organized by Fry for the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/manetpostimpress00graf  ''Manet and the post-impressionists''; Nov. 8 to Jan. 15, 1910-11, Grafton Galleries, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Fry's show, art critic [[Frank Rutter]] had put the term ''Post-Impressionist'' in print in ''Art News'' of 15 October 1910, during a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen /&gt;

Most of the artists in Fry's exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: "For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence (2005). ''Facts on File Encyclopedia of Art'': 5. New York: Facts on File, p. 804. {{ISBN|0-8160-5802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rewald]] limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, ''History of Impressionism'', and pointed out that a "subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period":&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"&gt;Rewald, John: ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'', revised edition: Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse'', was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as [[van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Seurat]], and [[Odilon Redon|Redon]]. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* [[Neo-Impressionism]]: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as [[Pointillism]]; [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac|Signac]] would have preferred other terms: [[Divisionism]] for example
* [[Cloisonnism]]: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]], was to promote the work of [[Louis Anquetin]], and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]
* [[Synthetism]]: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889|Café Volpini]].
* [[Pont-Aven School]]: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Henri Rousseau]] "le Douanier", [[Les Nabis]] and [[Cézanne]] as well as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], the young [[Picasso]] and Gauguin's last trip to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.

===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that "the term 'Post-Impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one." Convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886.  Rewald's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to "let the sources speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"/&gt;

Rival terms like [[Modernism]] or [[Symbolism in art|Symbolism]] were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* [[Modernism]], thus, is now considered to be the central movement within ''international'' western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: [[The Nabis]] for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term 'Post-Impressionism' were challenged again: [[Alan Bowness]] and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of [[World War I]], but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

So, while a split may be seen between classical 'Impressionism' and 'Post-Impressionism' in 1886, the end and the extent of 'Post-Impressionism' remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, '[[Cubism]]' was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in Anglosaxonia. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called [[Abstract painting|abstract]] and [[Suprematism|suprematic]]—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, ''Post-Impressionism'' is a term best used within Rewald's definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of ''[[Impressionists|impressionist]]'' painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from [[Cloisonnism]] to [[Cubism]]. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a [[World War I|World War]]—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about "Post-Impressionism" works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of "Post-Impressionism" in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">'''''Profanum''''' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "profane".  The distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] was considered by [[Émile Durkheim]] to be central to the social reality of human [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile (1976). ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', p. 37. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin (originally published 1915, English translation 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred/profane==

The profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the ''[[Lebenswelt]]'' or lifeworld.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the sacred, or ''sacrum'' in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or [[numinous]] can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an [[amulet]] for example may be sacred yet little respected.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

[[Rites of passage]] represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.

==Profane progress==
Modernization and the [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]] project have led to a [[secularisation]] of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredric Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter reaction==

The advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. [[Modernism]] set out to bring [[Mythology|myth]] and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 180-2&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Wallace Stevens]] speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fundamentalism]] – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco. ''Turning Back the Clock'' (2007) pp. 218–20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology]] too has set out to protect the [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] of the individual self from profane intrusion,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''The Psychology of Human Destiny'' (1974) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; establishing ritual places for inward work&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (1991) p. 194 and p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, p. 77-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
[[Seamus Heaney]] considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.&lt;ref&gt;Denis O'Driscoll, ''Stepping Stones'' (2008) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudorealism''', also spelled '''pseudo-realism''', is a term used in a variety of discourses connoting [[art]]istic and dramatic techniques, or work of art, film and literature perceived as superficial, ''not-real'', or non-realistic.&lt;ref name="ELS-AM"&gt;Eric Loren Smoodin, Ann Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Fs0Vwa_nQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xaHOTtSkB8OViQKC6LXPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;f=false ''Hollywood quarterly: film culture in postwar America, 1945-1957.'' Page 235.] ''University of California Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the term is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="huxley"&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/  A Defence Of Paradise-Engineering.] ''BLTC Research'', 1998. ''Use of term: pseudo-realism.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term pseudo-realism has been used to describe a certain type of cultural commodities such as film productions and TV programmes which portray everyday life in excessively realistic detail in order to achieve greater impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture Industry Revisited: Theodor W. Adorno on Mass Culture |author=Prof. Deborah Cook |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UtwDwenWBwC&amp;q=pseudo-realism |pages=46, 100 |ISBN=0847681556}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the great shift towards expressionism in painting, André Bazin used the word ''pseudoreal'' in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, [[photorealist]]ic CGI animation and [[3D computer graphics]] used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the [[special effects]] augmenting feature film through photographic deception of the eye have gained an entirely different dimension.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Surman |url=https://www.academia.edu/168038/CGI_Animation_Pseudorealism_Perception_and_Possible_Worlds  |title=CGI Animation - Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=GameCareerGuide.com (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer generated imagery and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds.  
{{quote|We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms – a fundamental deception of the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a deception of the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they are the product of man-made parameters. — David Surman, "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" &lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens equates ''pseudo-realism'' with [[Socialist realism]] of the Stalinist era as exposed by Orwell.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GnOe11NJXUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=definition+of+pseudo-realism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4f_qyMo9cg&amp;sig=VUkTJ3B4EpDI3VQTv8Bu9cIqhsk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iprOToTmOYPKiALAnP28Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20pseudo-realism&amp;f=false  ''Why Orwell Matters''. Page 93.] ''Basic Books'', 2003. {{ISBN|0465030505}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, invoke the old pseudo-real traditions of Indian film with no negative characters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onedimensional.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/vivaah-movie-review/  Vivaah - Movie review, 2006.]

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Johnson}}
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A '''riometer''' (commonly ''r''elative ''i''onospheric ''o''pacity meter, although originally: '''R'''elative '''I'''onospheric '''O'''pacity '''M'''eter for '''E'''xtra-'''T'''errestrial '''E'''missions of '''R'''adio noise&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.G. | last=Little | first2=H. | last2=Leinbach |date=February 1959 | title=The Riometer - A Device for the Continuous Measurement of Ionospheric Absorption | journal=Proceedings of the IRE | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=315–320 | doi= 10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287299}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an instrument used to quantify the amount of electromagnetic-wave [[ionospheric absorption]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R.D | last=Hunsucker |author2=J.K Hargreaves | year=2003 | title=The High-Latitude Ionosphere and its Effects on Radio Propagation|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, a riometer measures the "opacity" of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In the absence of any ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a ''quiet-day curve.'' Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in [[decibels]]. Riometers are generally passive radio [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] operating in the [[VHF]] radio frequency range (~30-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic [[synchrotron radiation]] and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.

==Description==
The riometer was developed in the mid 1950s by scientists at the [[University of Alaska]] who were researching the radio propagation effects of [[aurorae]].&lt;ref name="little" /&gt; At times aurorae resulted in complete failure of long distance radio communication to planes in the Arctic - a matter of considerable concern to the US Air Force at a time of tension with the Soviet Union{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Riometers are still used today for ionospheric research and are typically located in polar and sub-polar areas.

Initially, riometers were single, wide-beam detectors and measured the cosmic noise absorption (CNA). Multi-beam riometers have also been developed, which have multiple narrow beams, typically formed by a Butler matrix on a phased antenna array. Each beam forms its own riometer and has its own quiet-day curve determination. These individual beams form [[pixels]] on the sky allowing simple images of cosmic noise absorption to be formed.&lt;ref name="HonaryMarple2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honary|first1=F.|last2=Marple|first2=S.R.|last3=Barratt|first3=K.|last4=Chapman|first4=P.|last5=Grill|first5=M.|last6=Nielsen|first6=E.|title=Invited Article: Digital beam-forming imaging riometer systems|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=82|issue=3|year=2011|pages=031301|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.3567309}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, interferometry has been used to provide all-sky, spatially-continuous imaging of CNA.&lt;ref name="McKayFallows2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Fallows|first2=R.A.|last3=Norden|first3=M.|display-authors=etal|title=All-sky interferometric riometry|journal=Radio Science|volume=50|issue=10|year=2015|pages=1050–1061|issn=0048-6604|doi=10.1002/2015RS005709}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use riometers to observe multiple frequencies (typically in the range 25-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). An inverse problem technique can be applied to the measurements to ascertain not just the absorption, but a model of the electron content as a function of sight distance.&lt;ref name="KeroVierinen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kero|first1=A.|display-authors=etal|title=Ionospheric electron density profiles inverted from a spectral riometer measurement|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=41|issue=15|year=2014|pages=5370–5375|issn=0094-8276|doi=10.1002/2014GL060986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality''''' is a book dealing with the [[Monogamy#Evolutionary and historical development in humans|evolution of monogamy in humans]] and [[Mating system#In humans|human mating systems]]. First published in 2010, it was co-authored by [[Christopher Ryan (author)|Christopher Ryan]] and Cacilda Jethá ({{IPA-pt|kɐˈsiɫðɐ ʒɨˈta}}). In opposition to what the authors see as the "standard narrative" of human sexual evolution, they contend that having multiple sexual partners was common and accepted in the [[environment of evolutionary adaptedness]]. Mobile self-contained groups of hunter gatherers are posited as the human norm before agriculture led to high population density. According to the authors, before agriculture, sex was relatively promiscuous, and paternity was not a concern, in a similar way to the mating system of [[Bonobo]]s. According to the book, sexual interactions strengthened the bond of trust in the groups; far from causing jealousy, social equilibrium and reciprocal obligation was strengthened by playful sexual interactions.

The book generated a great deal of publicity in the popular press, where it was met with generally positive reviews. A number of scholars from related academic disciplines such as anthropology, evolutionary psychology, primatology, biology, and sexology have commented on the book; most have been critical of the book's methodology and some of its conclusions, although some academics have praised the book.

==Summary==
The authors argue that human beings evolved in [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[hunter-gatherer]] bands in which sexual interaction was a shared resource, much like food, child care, and group defense.&lt;ref name=Barash/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellsworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wrapping /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humanist&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Barry F.|date=March–April 2011|title=Speaking of Sex|url=http://thehumanist.org/march-april-2011/speaking-of-sex/|publisher=Humanist Magazine|accessdate=7 February 2013|author2=Arnell Dowret }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They think that much of [[evolutionary psychology]] has been conducted with a [[bias]] regarding human sexuality. The authors argue that the public and many researchers are guilty of the "''[[Flintstones|Flintstonization]]''" of [[hunter-gatherer]] society; that is to say projecting modern assumptions and beliefs onto earlier societies. Thus they think that there has been a bias to assuming that our species is primarily [[monogamous]] despite what they argue to be evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt; They argue for example, that our [[sexual dimorphism]], [[testicle]] size, [[female copulatory vocalization]], appetite for sexual novelty, various cultural practices, and hidden female [[ovulation]], among other factors strongly suggest a [[non-monogamous]], non-[[polygynous]] history. The authors argue that mate selection was not the subject of much intragroup competition among pre-agricultural humans, as sex was neither scarce nor commodified; rather [[sperm competition]] was a more important paternity factor than [[sexual selection]]. This behaviour survives among certain existent hunter-forager groups that believe in [[partible paternity]].

The authors argue as a result that [[conventional wisdom]] regarding human nature, as well as what they call the ''standard narrative'' of [[evolutionary psychology]] is wrong.&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt; This "standard narrative" goes like this: Males and females assess one another’s mate value from perspectives based upon their differing reproductive agendas/capacities: "He looks for signs of youth, fertility, health, absence of previous sexual experience, and likelihood of future sexual fidelity. In other words, his assessment is skewed toward finding a fertile, healthy young mate with many childbearing years ahead and no current children to drain his resources. b) She looks for signs of wealth (or at least prospects of future wealth), social status, physical health, and likelihood that he will stick around to protect and provide for their children. Her guy must be willing and able to provide materially for her (especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding) and their children (known as male parental investment)." Assuming they meet each other's criteria, they mate and form a monogamous pair bond. Following this, "she will be sensitive to indications that he is considering leaving (vigilant toward signs of infidelity involving intimacy with other women that would threaten her access to his resources and protection)—while keeping an eye out (around ovulation, especially) for a quick fling with a man genetically superior to her husband. He will be sensitive to signs of her sexual infidelities (which would reduce his all-important paternity certainty)—while taking advantage of short-term sexual opportunities with other women (as his sperm are easily produced and plentiful)."&lt;ref name=inquisition&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Christopher|title=Inquisition|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|publisher=sexatdawn.com|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313045906/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|archivedate=13 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They clarify: "we don’t see [the elements of the narrative] as elements of human nature so much as adaptations to social conditions—many of which were introduced with the advent of agriculture no more than ten thousand years ago."&lt;ref name=inquisition/&gt;

The authors take a broad position that goes beyond sexual behavior, arguing that humans are generally more egalitarian and selfless than is often thought. In an interview Ryan said, "we’re not saying that sharing was so widespread because everyone was loving and sitting around the fire singing “Kumbaya” every night. The reason that sharing was so widespread—and, so they claim, continues to be in the remaining hunter-gatherer societies in existence—is because it’s simply the most efficient way of distributing risk among a group of people."&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt; However, with the [[Neolithic revolution|advent of agriculture]] people's lifestyle changed completely, leading to the advent of private property and the accumulation of power. This fundamentally changed the way people behave and has left the modern human being in a situation where their instincts are at odds with the society they live in.

The authors do not take an explicit position in the book regarding the morality or desirability of monogamy or alternative sexual behavior in modern society, but argue that people should be made aware of our behavioral history so that they can make better informed choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Ryan|author2=Cacilda Jethá, M.D.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Sex at Dawn|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|work=Sex at Dawn Official Website|accessdate=7 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123143934/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|archivedate=23 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Popular media reception===
About six weeks after publication, ''Sex at Dawn'' debuted on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] at #24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-08/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and last appeared there as #33 three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-29/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was praised by syndicated [[Sex columnist|sex-advice columnist]] [[Dan Savage]], who wrote: "''Sex At Dawn'' is the single most important book about human sexuality since [[Alfred Kinsey]] unleashed ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' on the American public in 1948."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=4396681|title=Sex at Dawn|last=Savage|first=Dan|date=July 8, 2010|publisher=Thestranger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patel |first=Khadija |url=http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-03-17-sex-at-dawn-shattering-the-monogamy-myth-and-more |title='Sex At Dawn': shattering the monogamy myth, and more |work=[[Daily Maverick]] |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427235641/http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-03-17-sex-at-dawn-shattering-the-monogamy-myth-and-more |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Newsweek|''Newsweek'''s]] Kate Daily wrote, "This book takes a swing at pretty much every big idea on human nature: that poverty is an inevitable consequence of life on earth, that mankind is by nature brutish, and, most important, that humans evolved to be monogamous. ... [''Sex at Dawn''] sets out to destroy almost each and every notion of the discipline, turning the field on its head and taking down a few big names in science in the process. ... Funny, witty, and light ... the book is a scandal in the best sense, one that will have you reading the best parts aloud and reassessing your ideas about humanity's basic urges well after the book is done... Ryan and Jethá do an admirable job of poking holes in the prevailing evo-psych theories and are more apt to turn to biological, rather than psychological, evidence. That doesn’t mean their thesis is bulletproof. But it does mean there’s a lot of value in reconsidering basic assumptions about our beginnings that we widely accept today as gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/we-read-it/2010/07/26/sex-at-dawn-the-prehistoric-origins-of-modern-sexuality.html|title=&amp;nbsp;'Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality'&amp;nbsp;|date=July 26, 2010|last=Dailey|first=Kate|publisher=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was chosen as [[National Public Radio|NPR]] host [[Peter Sagal]]'s favorite book of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagal|first=Peter|title=Favorite Books Of 2010: Peter Sagal On 'Sex At Dawn'|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/12/02/131727213/favorite-books-of-2010-peter-sagal-on-sex-at-dawn|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Megan McArdle]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' criticized the book on her blog. She stated: "it reads like an undergraduate thesis—cherry-picked evidence stretched far out of shape to support their theory.  The language is breathless rather than scientific, and they don't even attempt to paper over the enormous holes in their theory that people are naturally polyamorous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Monogamy Unnatural?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/is-monogamy-unnatural/62273/|accessdate=25 June 2014|date=30 August 2010|first=Megan|last=Mcardle|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] [[immunology]] graduate student and science blogger Kevin Bonham also responded favorably to the book. He called the argument of Ryan and Jethá that "pre-agrarian human societies were exceedingly promiscuous" a "convincing" and well-documented one. However, Bonham cautioned his readers that "I can’t be certain that the authors aren’t [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]] examples that support their conclusions."&lt;ref name="Bonham"&gt;Bonham, Kevin. (17 June 2011) [http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/06/17/lets-talk-about-sex-at-dawn/ Let’s talk about sex (at dawn)], ''We Beasties''. [[Science Blogs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarly reception===
A few scholars with established expertise in disciplines related to the book such as anthropology, primatology, biology, sexology, and evolutionary psychology have commented on the book, mostly in self-published blogs and reviews, a few articles in the popular press, and two reviews by the same academic in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Most have been critical of the book's methodology and some of its conclusions, although some academics have praised the book. Ryan originally tried to publish the book with academic publisher [[Oxford University Press]], but it was rejected for publication after 2 of 3 peer reviews were negative during the publisher's internal peer-review process.&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;{{cite podcast| url = http://feralaudio.com/21-special-sex-at-dawn-episode-b-response-to-criticism/| title = 21 – Special Sex at Dawn Episode (B): Response to Criticism| website = | publisher = Tangentially Speaking| host = Christopher Ryan| date = 14 March 2013| time = | accessdate = 14 March 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130910235235/http://feralaudio.com/21-special-sex-at-dawn-episode-b-response-to-criticism/| archivedate = 10 September 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received the 2011 Ira and Harriet Reiss Theory Award from the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ira and Harriet Reiss Theory Award|url=http://www.sexscience.org/honors/the_ira_and_harriet_reiss_theory_award/|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive critique====
Some reviews particularly praise the book for confronting some of the established theories of evolutionary psychology. For example, anthropology professor Barbara J. King wrote, "lapses do mar more than one passage in the book. Yet on balance, Sex at Dawn is a welcome marriage of data from social science, animal behavior, and neuroscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookslut.com/features/2010_08_016440.php|title=Sex at Dawn (and at Noon, Dusk, and Midnight)|website=Bookslut.com|first=Barbara|last=King|date=August 2010|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexuality scholar Emily Nagoski also  agreed with many of the book's criticisms of evolutionary psychology, and the book's proposal "that monogamy is not the innate sociosexual system of humans," but concluded that due to errors of reasoning and understanding of evolutionary science "they come to the wrong conclusion about the nature of human sexuality."&lt;ref name=nagoski&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagoski|first1=Emily|title=Book review: Sex at Dawn|url=http://www.thedirtynormal.com/blog/2013/02/22/book-review-sex-at-dawn/|website=The Dirty Normal|accessdate=6 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808123320/http://www.thedirtynormal.com/blog/2013/02/22/book-review-sex-at-dawn/|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagoski ultimately concluded the book was "sloppily reasoned, contemptuous, and ignorant."

Eric Michael Johnson, graduate student in the history of science and primatology, wrote that the authors' conclusion, far from being completely novel and unsupported, had been advocated for decades by a significant minority of leading psychologists and anthropologists. For instance, [[Sarah Hrdy]], an eminent American anthropologist and primatologist, "advocated a promiscuous mating system for humans in ''The Woman That Never Evolved''" in 1999. Additionally, psychologist David Barash and psychiatrist Judith Lipton presented similar arguments in 2001.&lt;ref name=sexy /&gt; Johnson credits Ryan and Jethá for advancing their argument using evidence not available to its previous advocates, and doing so using a "relaxed writing style and numerous examples from modern popular culture."&lt;ref name=sexy&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Eric Michael|title=Sexy Beasts|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/sexy_beasts/|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=[[Seed Magazine]]|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative critique====
The book was criticized for its alleged "biased reporting of data, theoretical and evidentiary shortcomings, and problematic assumptions" in a pair of book reviews by anthropologist Ryan Ellsworth&lt;ref name=Wrapping /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ryan Ellsworth|url=https://missouri.academia.edu/RyanEllsworth/CurriculumVitae|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Missouri]]. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', Ellsworth argues that the book misrepresents the state of current research on [[sexual behavior]]. Ellsworth argues that while promiscuity has certainly been part of human behavior, it is "doubtful that this is because we are promiscuous at heart (this may apply to the behavior of most women more than the desire of most men), shackled by the trappings of a post-agricultural dilemma of our own devices, unable to return to the ancestral days of sexual communism." Noting that he could find no previous academic reviews of ''Sex at Dawn'', Ellsworth suggests that the book's positive reception in popular media will project "a distorted portrayal of current theory and evidence on evolved human sexuality" to the general public.&lt;ref name=Ellsworth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan|title=The Human That Never Evolved|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|series=3|pages=325–335|doi=10.1177/147470491201000316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wrapping&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan|title=The myth of promiscuity: A review of Lynn Saxon, Sex at Dusk: Lifting the Shiny Wrapping from Sex at Dawn|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2012|volume=10|issue=3|series=3|pages=611–616|doi=10.1177/147470491201000316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsworth and colleagues also note that contrary to what is argued in ''Sex at Dawn'', "the existence of partible paternity in some societies does not prove that humans are naturally promiscuous any more so than the existence of monogamy in some societies proves that humans are naturally monogamous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan M.|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Hill|first3=Kim R.|last4=Hurtado|first4=A.

Ryan argues that although Ellsworth makes some valid points, he misunderstood his and Jethá's central argument. According to Ryan, they did not argue that human sexuality was the same as bonobo sexuality; but rather that coitus was more frequent than is generally acknowledged, and that a typical human being would have had multiple partners within relatively short periods of time (i.e. each estrus cycle of a female). He argues that the main point of the book is to discredit "the standard narrative." He thinks reviewers read too much into the book, which merely seeks to challenge monogamy, rather than categorically reject it in favor of an alternative relationship model.&lt;ref name=podcast/&gt;

Lynn Saxon's rebuttal, ''Sex at Dusk'', itemized misrepresented citations and research errors found throughout ''Sex at Dawn''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In an approving ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' review of ''Sex at Dusk,'' [[David Barash]], co-author of ''[[The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People]]'' wrote that Ryan and Jethá "ignore and/or misrepresent reams of anthropology and biology in their eagerness to make a brief for some sort of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]-ian sexual idyll that exists—and/or existed—only in their overheated libidinous imaginations."&lt;ref name=Barash&gt;{{cite web|last=Barash|first=David|title=Sex at Dusk|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/sex-at-dusk-2/50099|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barash favorably quotes Saxon's criticism of ''Sex at Dawn'' for being "almost all about sex and not much about children ... [even though evolution] is very much about reproduction—variation in reproductive success is evolution" and endorses Saxon's characterization of the book as an "intellectually myopic, ideologically driven, pseudo-scientific fraud."&lt;ref name=Barash/&gt;

[[Herbert Gintis]], economist and evolutionary scholar, wrote that although the authors' conclusions are "usually not far from the truth," "Ryan and Jethá justify their position mostly by deploying anecdotal and unsystematic anthropological evidence, and the authors have no anthropological credentials" in a book review on Amazon.com. Gintis critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage, "which would make us unlike any other species I can think of" and suggests that their characterization of prehistoric human warfare is incorrect.&lt;ref name=gintis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gintis|first1=Herbert|title=Much that is True, but Remember: Is does not Imply Ought|url=http://smile.amazon.com/review/RKVMPRH1FYL2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0061707805&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books#wasThisHelpful|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviews argue that Ryan and Jethá set up a [[strawman]] argument with the "standard narrative." Both Gintis and Nagoski argue there is no "standard narrative" in modern scientific literature.&lt;ref name="gintis"/&gt; Nagoski says, "At no point does the book even attempt to convince me that this is the narrative; it simply asserts that it is so and moves on. As a person who has read a great deal of the science they cite, I can tell you that among scientists, S@D’s narrative is not remotely 'standard.' I could buy the argument that it is a CULTURAL narrative, and if that were the claim the authors were making, a great deal of my struggles with the book would be resolved."&lt;ref name=nagoski/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] called the book "[[pseudoscience]]" in a tweet.&lt;ref name="Sex @ Dusk tweet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tweet: Sex @ Dusk by Lynn Saxon, a rebuttal to the pseudoscience of "Sex at Dawn"|url=https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/228888697771266048|website=Twitter|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=29 March 2016|first=Steven|last=Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Dixson, professor of biological sciences at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], also "took issue" with key arguments about monogamy in ''Sex at Dawn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/science/sex-wars/|title=Sex wars|first=Rebecca|last=Priestley|newspaper=The Listener|accessdate=12 August 2014|date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists Peter K. Jonason and Rhonda Nicole Balzarini criticize the book for committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]], getting the evolutionary history of humans wrong, ignoring selection occurring at the level of individuals/genes and instead assuming [[group selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonason|first1=Peter K.|last2=Balzarini|first2=Rhonda N.|title=Unweaving the Rainbow of Human Sexuality: A Review of One-Night Stands, Serious Romantic Relationships, and the Relationship Space in Between|journal=The Psychology of Love and Hate in Intimate Relationships|date=1 January 2016|pages=13–28|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-39277-6_2|language=en|isbn=978-3-319-39275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologist [[Diana Fleischman]] has critiqued the book for inaccurately portraying evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-216-diana-fleischman-on-being-a-transhumanist-evolutionar.html|title=Rationally Speaking {{!}} Official Podcast of New York City Skeptics - Current Episodes - RS 216 - Diana Fleischman on "Being a transhumanist evolutionary psychologist"|website=rationallyspeakingpodcast.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and social theory author William von Hippel characterized the central argument of the book as "bullshit" and later as questionable among him and his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PowerfulJRE|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1201 - William von Hippel|date=2018-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dtv8ibI1vk&amp;t=22m55s|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEB was developed by researchers from [[Sofia University]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]]. The purpose of the SEB website is to facilitate the community of practice. It is hoped that such a community will help reduce the sense of isolation felt by young special education teachers and other special education stakeholders in rural areas of Bulgaria. The community is also intended to support special education stakeholders who are separated from their support network across busy cities or by the requirements of daily living.

The '''spread eagle''' (also spelled '''spreadeagle'''  or '''spread-eagle''') is the position in which a person has their arms outstretched and legs apart, figuratively resembling an [[eagle]] with [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|wings spread]]. It is a style that appears commonly in nature and geometry. In human style it is represented by the letter "X".

A spreadeagle is a common position in various fields. It is commonly used in [[dance]] routines, especially at the conclusion, in [[Spread eagle (figure skating)|figure skating]] and at the beginning of [[sky diving]].

==Sex position==

The spread eagle may also be a [[sex position]] in which one partner lies on their back facing up ([[supine position|supine]]) or (less commonly) lying facing down ([[prone position|prone]]) with arms and legs spread wide apart. When the partner is lying face down, it is a variation of the [[doggy style]] position, and when they are lying face up it is a variation of the [[missionary position]]. Another variation is for the receiving partner's legs to be closed, and the penetrating partner's to be wide apart. This variation is said to be better for stimulating the [[G-spot]] and the [[prostate gland]] and is sometimes called the [[peace sign]] position. The face up versions of the position are popular for [[oral sex]] play or [[erotic massage]].

Another variation is to have a standing, vertical spread eagle.

These positions are classic ingredients in [[sexual roleplay]].

==BDSM==
The spread eagle position is also employed as a [[Bondage_(BDSM)|bondage]] position in [[BDSM]] play, sometimes upside down. A standing or hanging position can be achieved using equipment such as a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]] or [[spreader bar]]s but can also be achieved with ropes or chains attached to different endpoints. As a [[Erotic_humiliation|humiliation]] technique it is popular for forcing the subject to display their genitals and to provide unhindered access to the crotch, groin and sometimes anal region for sexual play and torture.

}}

The '''Stationers’ Register''' was a record book maintained by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in [[England]].  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of [[copyright]] law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries&amp;mdash;for the [[Elizabethan era]], the [[Jacobean era]], the [[Caroline era]], and especially for [[English Renaissance theatre]]&amp;mdash;the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 3, pp. 164-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and [[Nathaniel Butter]] claimed the right to print "A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde." (They paid sixpence.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' pp. 265 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the [[playing company|companies of actors]] appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' ''[[As You Like It]],'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' were registered, apparently for such a purpose ("to be stayed"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only ''As You Like It'' remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or [[Statute of Anne]] entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">'''Study of Environmental Arctic Change''' (SEARCH) is a collaborative program of Arctic researchers, funding agencies, and others that facilitates synthesis of Arctic science and communicates our current understanding to help society respond to a rapidly changing Arctic. 

SEARCH activities are supported by a collaborative grant from the National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs, Arctic Sciences Section to the International Arctic Research Center (IARC; PLR-1331100 ) and the [https://www.arcus.org/ Arctic Research Consortium of the US] (ARCUS; PLR-1331083). These resources have been further supplemented by recent contributions from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the Center for the Blue Economy (Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey) and the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. Other agencies have provided program support in the past and continue their intellectual engagement.

SEARCH currently focuses on how shrinking land ice, diminishing sea ice, and degrading permafrost impact Arctic and global systems.&lt;ref name="Wiggins"&gt;{{cite journal|title=SEARCH: Study of Environmental Arctic Change--A System-scale, Cross-disciplinary, Long-term Arctic Research Program|last=Wiggins|first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">An '''umbrella effect''' is the protection extended by the presence of an [[umbrella species]] to other [[species]] in the same [[habitat]].  

The umbrella species is often either a [[flagship species]] whose [[Conservation biology|conservation]] benefits other species&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, 2002, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[keystone species]] which may be targeted for conservation due to its impact on an [[ecosystem]].  
&lt;br /&gt;More generally, an umbrella species determines the area over which conservation occurs.  
They are often representative of other species in their habitat, being an easily observable and known species.

==Example==
A good example of an umbrella species and its impact is summed up by Kimberly Andrews, a University of Georgia doctoral student at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Protecting a species like the [[Canebrake Rattlesnake|canebrake]] has practical applications, as protection measures would have broad [[natural environment|environmental]] value because of an umbrella effect. That is, protecting the [[rattlesnakes]] would ensure protection of other [[wildlife]] species that use the same habitats but are less sensitive to [[overdevelopment|development]] or require fewer [[resources]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Uses this concept==
The concept of an umbrella species is further utilized to create [[wildlife corridor]]s with what are termed [[EDGE species#Focal species|focal species]]. These focal species are chosen for a number of reasons and fall into several types, generally measured by their potential for an umbrella effect. By carefully choosing species based on this criterion, a linked or networked habitat can be created from single-species corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Arizona University (Majka, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are determined with the assistance of [[geographic information system]]s on the larger scale. Regardless of the location or scale of conservation, the umbrella effect is a measurement of a species' impact on others and is an important part of determining an approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">The '''École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem''', commonly known as '''École Biblique''', is a French academic establishment in [[Jerusalem]], founded by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s, and specialising in [[archaeology]] and [[Bible|Biblical]] [[exegesis]].

The school is part of the Dominican St. Stephen's Priory, French: "Couvent de Saint-Étienne". All the teachers of the École Biblique are Dominican friars, and all members of the Dominican priory are involved in the work of the École.&lt;ref&gt;Aviva Bar-Am, ''St. Stephen’s Monastary [sic] - The brothers' work'', [[Jerusalem Post]], 14 September 2009 [http://www.jpost.com/Israel-Guide/Jerusalem-Area-Tours/St-Stephens-Monastary-The-brothers-work]&lt;/ref&gt;

The priory is centred around the modern [[Basilica of St Stephen, Jerusalem|Basilica of St Stephen]] ('''Saint-Étienne''') built over the ruins of an ancient predecessor, to which the supposed relics of [[Saint Stephen]] were transferred in 439, making the [[Byzantine period|Byzantine-period]] church the centre of the cult of this particular saint.

==Foundation==
The school was founded in 1890 under the name ''École pratique d’études bibliques'' by [[Marie-Joseph Lagrange]], a Dominican priest. In 1920, it took its current name, following its recognition, by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]], as a national archaeological school in France.

==Disciplines==
Since its creation, the school has been involved in the exegesis of biblical text, and has carried out archaeological research, in a complementary manner and without secrecy&lt;!--mistranslation from french article?--&gt;, in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the adjacent territories. Its principal disciplines are [[epigraphy]], the [[Semitic language]]s, [[Assyriology]], [[Egyptology]], other aspects of ancient history, [[geography]], and [[ethnography]].

It has the power to confer official doctorates in ''Holy Scripture''. It publishes the ''[[Revue Biblique]]'', which is a diverse collection of scholarship from its fields of excellence, and it also publishes material addressed to larger audiences, including a particular [[Bible translations (French)|French translation of the Bible]], known as the [[Jerusalem Bible]] (a work which strove both for critical translational rigour and for quality as a piece of literature).

Among its most illustrious members, in addition to Marie-Joseph Lagrange, are [[Marie-Emile Boismard]], [[Roland de Vaux]], [[Raymond-Jacques Tournay]], and [[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]].

===Qumrân discoveries===
Following the discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the scholars at the school have been heavily involved in the translation and interpretation of the texts.

==Relationship to the Vatican authorities==
The school and its founder were, for a long time, regarded as 'suspect' by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] authorities, as a consequence of the [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist Crisis]]. Lagrange himself, like other scholars involved in the 19th century renaissance of biblical studies, was suspected of being a Modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Montagnes, ''Marie-Joseph Lagrange'', éd. Cerf, 2004, pp. 204-205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=THCSMvmBQNkC&amp;hl=fr extraits en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt; The school was briefly closed.

In 1909, conflict between the Dominicans and the [[Jesuits]], common at the time, resulted in the Pope's creation of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], as a Jesuit rival to the school.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Montagnes, ''Les séquelles de la crise moderniste. L'Ecole biblique au lendemain de la Grande Guerre'', in ''Revue thomiste'', XCVIII&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year vol. XC, n°2, pp. 245-270, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between the Jesuits and the Dominicans (and their respective institutions) has gradually calmed down, particularly after the 1943 papal encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]''.
