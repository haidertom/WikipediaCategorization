'''Aline Bernstein''' (December 22, 1880 – September 7, 1955) was an American set designer and [[costume designer]]. She and [[Irene Lewisohn]] founded the [[Museum of Costume Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1944 |publisher=[[Playbill]] |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/68652.html |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |quote=Philanthropist Irene Lewisohn died today in New York City.

==Early life==
She was born in 1880 in New York City, the daughter of Rebecca (Goldsmith) and Joseph Frankau, an actor. Joseph was a cousin of London cigar importer [[Arthur Frankau]] and thus, by marriage, of novelist and art historian [[Julia Frankau|Frank Danby]], whom Aline recalled visiting as a child when Joseph Frankau was performing in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Aline (1941) ''An Actor's Daughter'', A. A. Knopf – Ch. 7 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernstein-aline&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she was 17, both of her parents had died and she was raised by her aunt, Rachel Goldsmith. Goldsmith had a theatrical boarding house on West 44th Street in New York City.

==Career==
[[File:Wish-To-Be-Alone-Grand-Hotel-1930.jpg|thumb|One of Bernstein's set designs for the original Broadway production of ''Grand Hotel'' (1930)]]
[[File:The-Children's-Hour-1935-1.jpg|thumb|Bernstein's setting for the original Broadway production of ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1934)]]
Between 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

Bernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name.

In 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer.&lt;ref name="Essin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Essin|first1=Christin|title=Stage Designers in Early Twentieth-Century America: Artists, Activists, Cultural Critics|date=2012|publisher=Publshr|location=Loc|page=43| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0M-cNuICBMoC&amp;pgn=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

In the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], a highly respected publisher at that time.&lt;ref name="Essin" /&gt; She was personal friends with [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.|Arthur]] and [[Blanche Knopf]].&lt;ref name="marshall 229"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauldin |first=Joanne Marshall |year=2007 |title=Thomas Wolfe: When Do the Atrocities Begin? |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |isbn=1-57233-494-0 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book, ''Three Blue Suits'', helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears – or drags (the jacket on the floor) – his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively.&lt;ref name= "Essin" /&gt;

Some of her publications include:
* "Three Blue Suits" (collection of short stories), 1933
* ''The Journey Down'' (over her relationship with Wolfe), Knopf, 1938
* ''Miss Condon'', Knopf, 1947
* ''An Actor's Daughter'' (memoir), 1940
* ''The Martha Washington Doll Book'', 1945
* ''Masterpieces of Women's Costume of the 18th and 19th Centuries'', 1959 (published posthumously)

In 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the [[opera]] ''Regina''. The music and [[libretto]] were written [[Marc Blitzstein]] but based on the play ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]], a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grout|first =Donald Jay|authorlink = Donald Jay Grout|author2=Hermine Weigel Williams|title=A Short History of Opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11958-5|page=742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBDB" /&gt; Although that production of ''Regina'' (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a [[Tony Award|Tony]] for her costume design in 1950.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aline Bernstein|url=http://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/Aline-Bernstein-24670|website=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League, Inc.|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aline married Theodore F. Bernstein, a Wall Street broker, on November 19, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CfGHM9KU7aEC&amp;pg=PA74 Biography of Bernstein] in ''Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary, Volume 4'', edited by Barbara Sicherman, Carol Hurd Green on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein and her husband had two children: Theodore Frankau Bernstein (1904–1949), and Edla Cusick (1906–1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 12, 1949 |title=T.

Wolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', ''[[The Web and the Rock]]'', and ''[[You Can't Go Home Again]]''.

'''''Amistad''''' is a 1997 American [[Historical period drama|historical drama]] film directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], based on the true story of the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship ''[[La Amistad]]'', during which [[Mende people|Mende]] tribesmen abducted for the slave trade managed to gain control of their captors' ship off the coast of [[Cuba]], and the international [[United States v. The Amistad|legal battle]] that followed their capture by the ''[[Washington (1837)|Washington]]'', a U.S. [[revenue cutter]]. The case was ultimately [[United States v. The Amistad|resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841]].

[[Morgan Freeman]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]] had starring roles. [[David Franzoni]]'s screenplay was based on the book ''[[Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy]]'' (1987), by the historian Howard Jones.

==Plot==
''La Amistad'' is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the United States in 1839. It is carrying African slaves as its cargo. As the ship is crossing from Cuba to the United States, [[Joseph Cinqué|Cinqué]], a leader of the Africans, leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead, the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail north to the east coast of the United States, where the ship is stopped by the American Navy, and the living Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves.

In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English, the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. District Attorney [[William S. Holabird]] brings charges of piracy and murder. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]], on behalf of President [[Martin Van Buren]] (who is campaigning for re-election), represents the claim of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] that the Africans are slaves and are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers,  Thomas R. Gedney, and Richard W. Meade, claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators, Pedro Montez and Jose Ruiz,  produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], hired by the abolitionist [[Lewis Tappan]] and his black associate Theodore Joadson, decides to defend the Africans.

Baldwin argues that the Africans had been captured in Africa to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard ''La Amistad'' that the African people were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship, the ''[[Tecora]]''. Therefore, the Africans were free citizens of another country and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence, the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin, who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced. Consequently, seeking to make the case more personal, on the advice of former American president (and lawyer) [[John Quincy Adams]], Baldwin and Joadson find [[James Covey]], a former slave who speaks both Mende and English. Cinque tells his story at trial: Cinque was kidnapped by slave traders outside his village, and held in the slave fortress of [[Lomboko]], where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard. Cinque and many others were then sold to the ''Tecora'', where they were held in the brig of the ship. The captives were beaten and whipped, and at times, were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other's faces. One day, 50 captives were thrown overboard. Later on, the ship arrived in Havana, Cuba. Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to ''La Amistad''.

District Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqué's "tale" of being captured and kept in the slave fortress, and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard. However, the [[Royal Navy]]'s fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the [[West Africa Squadron]] backs up Cinqué's account. Baldwin shows from the ''Tecora''{{'}}s inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by 50. Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime. But in the ''Tecora''{{'}}s case, they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey. As the tension rises, Cinqué stands up from his seat and repeatedly cries, "Give us, us free!"

Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans. After pressure from Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] on President Van Buren, the case is appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented, Adams agrees to assist with the case. At the Supreme Court, he makes an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release, and is successful.

The [[Lomboko|Lomboko slave fortress]] is liberated by the [[Royal Marines]] under the command of Captain Fitzgerald. After all the slaves were hurried out of the fortress, Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy it. He then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that he was right—the slave fortress doesn't exist.

Because of the release of the Africans, Van Buren loses his re-election campaign, and tension builds between the North and the South, which would eventually culminate in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

==Production==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Actress and director [[Debbie Allen]] had run across some books about the mutiny on ''[[La Amistad]]'' and brought the subject to [[HBO films]], which chose to make a film adaptation of the subject. She later presented the project to [[DreamWorks SKG]] to release the film, which agreed. Steven Spielberg, who wanted to stretch his artistic wings after making ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997), was interested in directing it for DreamWorks, which he also co-founded, as well.

Filming of the exterior and interior court scenes took place at the Old Colony House in Newport, RI, and then moved to Sonalyst Studios. The opening scene was filmed on a sound stage in [[Universal Studios]]. Production then went to Puerto Rico for the scenes set in Africa, including those with the slave fortress.

Post-production was done rarely with Spielberg, due to his commitment to another DreamWorks film, ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.

==Historical accuracy==
Many academics, including [[Columbia University]] professor [[Eric Foner]], have criticized ''Amistad'' for historical inaccuracy and the misleading characterizations of the ''Amistad'' case as a "turning point" in the American perspective on slavery.
&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric. [http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/74/ "The Amistad Case in Fact and Film"], History Matters. Accessed December 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Foner wrote:
{{quote|In fact, the ''Amistad'' case revolved around the Atlantic slave trade — by 1840 outlawed by international treaty — and had nothing whatsoever to do with slavery as a domestic institution. Incongruous as it may seem, it was perfectly possible in the nineteenth century to condemn the importation of slaves from Africa while simultaneously defending slavery and the flourishing slave trade within the United States.}}
{{quote|''Amistad''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s problems go far deeper than such anachronisms as President Martin Van Buren campaigning for re-election on a whistle-stop train tour (in 1840, candidates did not campaign), or people constantly talking about the impending [[American Civil War|Civil War]], which lay twenty years in the future.}}

Other reported inaccuracies include:

* Despite what the film suggests, the actual Supreme Court decision reversed District and Circuit decrees regarding the Africans' conveyance back to Africa; they were to be deemed free, but the U.S. government could not take them back to Africa, as they had arrived on American soil as free people.&lt;ref&gt;Story, Joseph.

Ed. 826 (January 1841 Term), Cornell University Law School. Accessed December 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film version of Adams' closing speech before the Supreme Court and the court's decision as read by Justice Joseph Story bear no resemblance to the much longer historical versions; they are not even fair summaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/amistad/AMI_SCT2.HTM "The United States, Appellants, v.

* During the scene depicting the destruction of the [[Lomboko]] slave fortress by a [[Royal Navy]] [[schooner]], the vessel's captain refers to another officer as "[[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]". This rank has never been used by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;British Royal Navy ranks (including relevant time period) [http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm "Officer Ranks in the Royal Navy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015812/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm |date=2014-10-11 }}, Royal Naval Museum.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Amistad'' received mainly positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film receives an approval rating of 77% based on reviews from 64 critics, with an average score of 6.9/10. its consensus reads: "Heartfelt without resorting to preachiness, ''Amistad'' tells an important story with engaging sensitivity and absorbing skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Susan Wloszczyna of ''[[USA Today]]'' summed up the feelings of many reviewers when she wrote: "as Spielberg vehicles go, ''Amistad'' — part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy — lands between the disturbing lyricism of ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and the storybook artificiality of ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Wloszczyna, Susan. "''Amistad'' review", ''USA Today''. Accessed December 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: 
{{blockquote|"Amistad," like Spielberg's "Schindler's List," is [...] about the ways good men try to work realistically within an evil system to spare a few of its victims. [...] "Schindler's List" works better as narrative because it is about a risky deception, while "Amistad" is about the search for a truth that, if found, will be small consolation to the millions of existing slaves. As a result, the movie doesn't have the emotional charge of Spielberg's earlier film — or of "The Color Purple," which moved me to tears. [...] What is most valuable about "Amistad" is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 09.jpg|thumb|250px|right| This image of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] was chosen as the most famous picture by an anonymous photographer by ''The Photograph Book'' (1997) ({{ISBN|0-7148-3937-X}}), a book of 500 photographs by 500 famous photographers]]
'''Anonymous works''' are works, such as [[art]] or [[literature]], that have an [[Anonymity|anonymous]], undisclosed, or unknown creator or author. In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. There are a number of reasons anonymous works arise.

== Description ==
In the [[United States]], anonymous work is legally defined as "a work on the copies or [[phonorecord]]s of which no [[natural person]] is identified as [[author]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|title=Selected Sections of the Copyright Act|date=1997-12-17|accessdate=2008-06-22|work=UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185159/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|archivedate=11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. In such cases the author is often referred to as [[Wikt:anonymus|Anonymus]], the [[Latin]]  form of "anonymous". In other cases, the creator's name is intentionally kept secret. The author's reasons may vary from fear of [[persecution]] to protection of his or her reputation.  Legal reasons may also bar an author from self-identifying, as in 2007, when ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article by an anonymous author—who would have preferred to be named—describing the use of [[national security letters]] by the [[FBI]].{{cn|date=August 2013}}

'''''Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco''''' is a book about the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO) of [[RJR Nabisco]], written by [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] [[Bryan Burrough]] and [[John Helyar]]. The book is based upon a series of articles written by the authors for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The book was later made into a [[made-for-TV movie]] by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], also called ''[[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|Barbarians at the Gate]]''. The book centers on [[F. Ross Johnson]], the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of RJR Nabisco, who planned to buy out the rest of the Nabisco [[shareholder]]s.

==Summary==
Those opposed to Johnson's bid for the company, [[Henry Kravis]] and his cousin [[George R. Roberts]], were among the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO). Kravis was the first person Johnson talked to about doing the LBO and feels betrayed after learning that Johnson wants to do the deal with another firm, [[American Express]]'s former [[Lehman Brothers|Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division. [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]] buyout firm also played a prominent role.

After Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences, a bidding war takes place which Johnson will eventually lose. The unfortunate side effect of the augmented buyout price to the shareholders is the creation of a worrying level of [[debt]] for the company.

The title of the book comes from a statement by Forstmann, in which he calls Kravis' money "phoney [[junk bond]] crap" and declares him and his cousin as "real people with real money," also stating that to stop raiders like Kravis: "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

==Important personalities==

*[[Edward A. Horrigan, Jr.|Ed Horrigan]], president and chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division of RJR Nabisco

*[[George R. Roberts]], senior partner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
*[[James D. Robinson III|Jim Robinson]], chairman and chief executive, [[American Express]]

==Film adaptation==
The book was adapted by [[Larry Gelbart]] for a [[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|1993 television movie of the same name]] directed by [[Glenn Jordan]].

==Publishing information and reception==
In 2008, [[Harper Collins]] re-released ''Barbarians'' to mark the two-decade anniversary of the RJR deal. Media columnist Jon Friedman at [[MarketWatch]] opined on the occasion that it was "the best business book ever." Friedman spoke with the authors about the two-decade history of the book and of their ensuing careers (the two undertook no further joint projects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/barbarians-gate-authors-reflect-wall/story.aspx?guid={96E5F741-4FA2-4D8B-97F2-493F07358505}&amp;dist=msr_15 "'Barbarians at the Gate' authors reflect"] by Jon Friedman, ''MarketWatch'', 11-21-08. Retrieved 2-7-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Business reporter [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote in his book ''[[Too Big to Fail (book)|Too Big to Fail]]'' that this is his favourite business book of all time.

'''Baroque architecture''' is the building style of the [[Baroque]] era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] vocabulary of [[Renaissance architecture]] and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the [[Catholic Church]]. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.  Common features of Baroque architecture included gigantism of proportions; a large open central space where everyone could see the altar;  twisting columns, theatrical effects, including light coming from a cupola above;  dramatic interior effects created with bronze and gilding; clusters of sculpted angels and other figures high overhead;  and an extensive use of [[trompe-l'oeil]], also called "quadratura,"  with painted architectural details and figures on the walls and ceiling, to increase the dramatic and theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Renaissance drew on the wealth and power of the Italian courts and was a blend of secular and religious forces, the Baroque was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) is usually given as the beginning of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque architecture and its embellishments were on the one hand more accessible to the emotions and on the other hand, a visible statement of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church. The new style manifested itself in particular in the context of the new religious orders, like the [[Theatines]] and the [[Jesuits]] who aimed to improve popular piety.

[[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]], such as the example of [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] (1726-1743), developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the High Roman Baroque can be assigned to the papal reigns of [[Urban VIII]], [[Innocent X]] and [[Alexander VII]], spanning from 1623 to 1667. The three principal architects of this period were the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Francesco Borromini]] and the painter [[Pietro da Cortona]] and each evolved his own distinctively individual architectural expression.

Dissemination of Baroque architecture to the south of Italy resulted in regional variations such as [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture or that of [[Naples]] and [[Lecce]]. To the north, the Theatine architect [[Camillo-Guarino Guarini]], [[Bernardo Vittone]] and Sicilian born [[Filippo Juvarra]] contributed Baroque buildings to the city of [[Turin]] and the [[Piedmont]] region.

A synthesis of Bernini, Borromini and Cortona’s architecture can be seen in the late Baroque architecture of northern Europe which paved the way for the more decorative [[Rococo]] style.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Baroque style had found its secular expression in the form of grand palaces, first in France—with the [[Château de Maisons]] (1642) near Paris by [[François Mansart]]—and then throughout Europe.

During the 17th century, Baroque architecture spread through Europe and Latin America, where it was particularly promoted by the Jesuits.

== Precursors and features of Baroque architecture ==
[[Michelangelo]]'s late Roman buildings, particularly [[St. Peter's Basilica]], may be considered precursors to Baroque architecture. His pupil [[Giacomo della Porta]] continued this work in Rome, particularly in the façade of the Jesuit church [[Il Gesù]], which leads directly to the most important church façade of the early Baroque, [[Santa Susanna]] (1603), by [[Carlo Maderno]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Maderno’s facade, see Wittkower R., ''Art &amp; Architecture in Italy 1600–1750'', 1985 edn, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive features of Baroque architecture can include:
* 	in churches, broader naves and sometimes given oval forms
*	fragmentary or deliberately incomplete architectural elements
*	dramatic use of light; either strong light-and-shade contrasts (''[[chiaroscuro]]'' effects) as at the church of [[Weltenburg Abbey]], or uniform lighting by means of several windows (e.g. church of [[Weingarten Abbey]])
*	opulent use of colour and ornaments (''putti'' or figures made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing)
*	large-scale ceiling frescoes
*	an external façade often characterized by a dramatic central projection
*	the interior is a shell for painting, sculpture and stucco (especially in the late Baroque)
*	illusory effects like [[trompe l'oeil]] (an art technique involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions.) and the blending of [[painting]] and [[architecture]]
*	pear-shaped domes in the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Czech Baroque architecture|Czech]], [[Baroque in Poland|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]
*	Ornate detail is key in identifying Baroque architecture ex, [[Palace of Versailles]]

=== Baroque and colonialism ===
[[File:Church of Immaculate Conception, Panjim 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|During the Portuguese colonization of [[Goa]], India brought about many churches with baroque architecture ([[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]]).]]

Though the tendency has been to see Baroque architecture as a European phenomenon, it coincided with, and is integrally enmeshed with, the rise of European [[colonialism]]. Colonialism required the development of centralized and powerful governments with Spain and France, the first to move in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;Though there is a vast literature on the subject, a succinct overview can be found in: Francis Ching, [[Mark Jarzombek]], Vikram Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'', Wiley Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialism brought in huge amounts of wealth, not only in the silver that was extracted from the mines in Bolivia, Mexico and elsewhere, but also in the resultant trade in commodities, such as sugar and tobacco. The need to control trade routes, monopolies, and slavery, which lay primarily in the hands of the French during the 17th century, created an almost endless cycle of wars between the colonial powers: the [[French religious wars]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 and 1648), [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco–Spanish War]] (1653), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), and so on. The initial mismanagement of colonial wealth by the Spaniards bankrupted them in the 16th century (1557 and 1560), recovering only slowly in the following century. This explains why the Baroque style, though enthusiastically developed throughout the [[Spanish Empire]], was to a large extent, in Spain, an architecture of surfaces and façades, unlike in France and Austria where we see the construction of numerous huge palaces and monasteries. In contrast to Spain, the French, under [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619–1683), the minister of finance, had begun to industrialize their economy, and thus, were able to become, initially at least, the benefactors of the flow of wealth. While this was good for the building industries and the arts, the new wealth created an inflation, the likes of which had never been experienced before. Rome was known just as much for its new sumptuous churches as for its vagabonds.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pater. ''Renaissance Rome''.  (University of California Press, 1976) pp.70–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
{{Main article|Italian Baroque|Italian Baroque architecture}}

=== Rome and Southern Italy ===
{{See also|Sicilian Baroque}} A number of ecclesiastical buildings of the Baroque period in Rome had plans based on the Italian paradigm of the basilica with a crossed dome and nave, but the treatment of the architecture was very different from what had been carried out previously. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in the Gesù, was the church of Santa Susanna, designed by Carlo Maderno. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, but it still maintains rigor.

The same concerns with plasticity, massing, dramatic effects and shadow and light is evident in the architectural work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by his design of [[Santi Luca e Martina]] (construction began in 1635) with what was probably the first curved Baroque church façade in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', 1979, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are even more evident in his reworking of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656–68). The façade with its [[chiaroscuro]] half-domed portico and concave side wings, closely resembles a theatrical stage set and the church façade projects forward so that it substantially fills the tiny trapezoidal piazza. Other Roman ensembles of the Baroque and Late Baroque period are likewise suffused with theatricality and, as urban theatres, provide points of focus within their locality in the surrounding cityscape.

Probably the most well known example of such an approach is [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The piazza, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is formed principally by two colonnades of free standing columns centred on an Egyptian [[obelisk]]. Bernini's own favourite design was his oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] decorated with polychome marbles and an ornate gold dome. His secular architecture included the [[Palazzo Barberini]] based on plans by Maderno and the [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] by [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's rival, the architect [[Francesco Borromini]], produced designs that deviated dramatically from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance. His building plans were based on complex geometric figures, his architectural forms were unusual and inventive and he employed multi-layered symbolism in his architectural designs. Borromini's architectural spaces seem to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of Michelangelo. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a complicated plan arrangement that is partly oval and partly a cross and so has complex convex-concave wall rhythms. A later work, the church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same playful inventiveness and antipathy to the flat surface, epitomized by an unusual "corkscrew" lantern above the dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in Rome. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]. Fontana's academic approach, though lacking the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects he trained, who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to Paris. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome—[[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727)—had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Basilica di Superga]] near [[Turin]] by [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]

The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober and classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

=== Northern Italy ===
In the north of Italy, the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects&amp;mdash;[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]], and [[Bernardo Vittone]]&amp;mdash;to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[solid geometry|stereometry]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details, and the airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roof-line and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. The rustic ambiance encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini, none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

[[File:Wignacourt Arch 2016-05-08.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Wignacourt Arch]], one of the earliest Baroque structures in Malta]]

The Baroque style was introduced in Malta in the early 17th century, possibly by the Bolognese architect and engineer [[Bontadino de Bontadini]], who was responsible for the construction of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] between 1612 and 1615. The earliest Baroque structures in Malta were the decorative elements within the aqueduct, such as the [[Wignacourt Arch]] and [[Wignacourt Aqueduct#Fountains|several fountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello|title=Histories of Malta – Convictions and Conjectures|date=2003|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9789993210276|pages=44–61|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Histories_of_Malta.html?id=SB4jAQAAIAAJ|chapter=Bontadino de Bontadini – The Murder of the First Baroque Architect in Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hauptaltar der St. John’s Co-Cathedral.JPG|thumb|left|The High Baroque altar of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]]]]

Baroque architecture became popular after [[Francesco Bounamici]] designed the [[Church of the Jesuits]] in [[Valletta]] in 1635. In the subsequent decades, many churches, public buildings, city gates, palaces and other structures were constructed or rebuilt in this style. New churches were built in the Baroque style, while older ones were rebuilt or redecorated.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baroque Architecture|url=http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|website=Culture Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630172716/http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|archivedate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the interior of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], which was completely redesigned by [[Mattia Preti]] in the 1660s, and the [[Our Lady of Victories Church, Valletta|Church of Our Lady of Victories]], which had its façade rebuilt in 1752.

The architect [[Lorenzo Gafà]] designed many Baroque churches between the 1660s and the 1700s, including the [[Saint Lawrence's Church, Vittoriosa|Church of St. Lawrence]] in [[Birgu]] (1681–97), [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Mdina]] (1696–1705) and the [[Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in [[Victoria, Gozo]] (1697–1711).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. II G-Z|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auberge de Castille.jpeg|thumb|[[Auberge de Castille]]]]

The most monumental Baroque building in Malta is [[Auberge de Castille]], which was rebuilt in 1741–45 by [[Andrea Belli]].&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt; Other examples of secular Baroque architecture in Malta include [[Hostel de Verdelin]] ({{circa}} 1650s), parts of [[Fort Manoel]] (1723–33), the [[Mdina Gate]] (1724) and the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] (1757–60).

The Baroque style remained popular in Malta until the late 18th and early 19th century, when the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style was introduced. However, traditional Maltese architecture continued to have significant Baroque influences.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt;

[[File:La Granja Palacio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso|Royal Palace of La Granja]]]]
As Italian Baroque influences penetrated across the [[Pyrenees]], they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of [[Juan de Herrera]], which had been in vogue since the late 16th century. As early as 1667, the façades of [[Granada Cathedral]] (by [[Alonso Cano]]) and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén Cathedral]] (by [[Eufrasio López de Rojas]]) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom.
[[File:Santiago GDFL catedral 050318 43.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The most impressive display of Churrigueresque spatial decoration may be found in the west façade of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]).]]
In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The [[Churriguera]] family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herreresque classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the [[Churrigueresque]]. Within half a century, they transformed [[Salamanca]] into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. Among the highlights of the style, the interiors of the [[Granada Charterhouse]] offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking [[chiaroscuro]] effects in his ''Transparente'' for the [[Toledo Cathedral]].
[[File:Universidad de Valladolid. Fachada.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|[[Facade of the University of Valladolid]] (1716-1718).]]
The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]'s blend of [[Solomonic column]]s and [[composite order]], known as the "supreme order". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety.

Two of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic façades of the [[University of Valladolid]] (Diego Tomé, 1716-1718) and [[Hospicio de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald [[Antonio Gaudí]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. The focus of the florid ornamentation is an elaborately sculptured surround to a main doorway. If we remove the intricate maze of broken pediments, undulating cornices, stucco shells, inverted tapers, and garlands from the rather plain wall it is set against, the building's form would not be affected in the slightest.

{{main article|New Spanish Baroque|Andean Baroque|Churrigueresque}}
[[File:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]], [[Mexico City]], started in 1573]]
The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin-towered façades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when a Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in [[Cusco]] was built. Even then, the new style hardly affected the structure of churches.

To the north, the richest province of 18th-century [[New Spain]]&amp;mdash;Mexico&amp;mdash;produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as Mexican Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the [[Sagrario Metropolitano]] in [[Mexico City]]. Other fine examples of the style may be found in remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at [[Ocotlán, Tlaxcala|Ocotlán]] (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.emory.edu/culpeper/BAKEWELL/images/ocotlan-ch.jpg Exterior] and [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/bevans/Art454L-58-Tlaxcala/F00006.JPG Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Augustine Church - Paoay, Ilocos Norte.jpg|thumb|[[Paoay Church]] in the Philippines is a fine example of [[Earthquake Baroque]].]]
The true capital of Mexican Baroque is [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], where a ready supply of hand-painted ceramics ([[talavera (pottery)|talavera]]) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian flavour. There are about sixty churches whose façades and domes display glazed tiles of many colours, often arranged in Arabic designs. The interiors are densely saturated with elaborate gold leaf ornamentation. In the 18th century, local artisans developed a distinctive brand of white stucco decoration, named "alfenique" after a Pueblan candy made from egg whites and sugar.

The Peruvian Baroque was particularly lavish, as evidenced by the [[Monastery of San Francisco, Lima|monastery of San Francisco]] at [[Lima]] (1673). While the rural Baroque of the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]], followed the model of Il Gesu, provincial "mestizo" (crossbred) styles emerged in [[Arequipa]], [[Potosí]], and [[La Paz]]. In the 18th century, architects of the region turned for inspiration to the [[Mudéjar]] art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian façade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of La Merced in Lima. Similarly, the Church of La Compañia in [[Quito]] suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted façade and a surfeit of spiral [[salomónica]].

Earthquake Baroque is a style of Baroque architecture found in the [[Philippines]], which suffered destructive [[earthquake]]s during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], were rebuilt in a [[Baroque]] style. Similar events led to the [[Pombaline Downtown|Pombaline]] architecture in [[Lisbon]] following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and [[Sicilian Baroque]] in [[Sicily]] following the [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693 earthquake]].

Nothwithstanding a prodigality of sensually rich surface decoration associated with Baroque architecture of the Iberian Peninsula, the royal courts of [[Madrid]] and [[Lisbon]] generally favoured a more sober architectural vocabulary distilled from 17th-century Italy. The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|royal palaces of Madrid]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and [[Convent of Mafra|Mafra]] were designed by architects under strong influence of Bernini and Juvarra. In the realm of church architecture, Guarini's design for Santa Maria della Divina Providenza in Lisbon was a pace-setter for structural audacity in the region (even though it was never built).

In Portugal, the first fully Baroque church was the [[Church of Santa Engrácia]], in Lisbon, designed by royal architect [[João Antunes]], which has a Greek cross floorplan and curved facades. Antunes also designed churches in which the inner space is rectangular but with curved corners (like the Menino de Deus Church in Lisbon), a scheme that is found in several 18th-century churches in Portugal and Brazil. The court of John V, on the other hand, favoured Roman baroque models, as attested by the work of royal architect [[Ludovice]], a German who designed the [[Convent of Mafra|Royal Palace of Mafra]], built after 1715.

By the mid-18th century, northern Portuguese architects had absorbed the concepts of Italian Baroque to revel in the plasticity of local granite in such projects as the surging 75-metre-high [[Torre dos Clérigos]] in [[Porto]]. The foremost centre of the national Baroque tradition was [[Braga]], whose buildings encompass virtually every important feature of Portuguese architecture and design. The Baroque shrines and palaces of Braga are noted for polychrome ornamental patterns, undulating roof-lines, and irregularly shaped window surrounds.

Brazilian architects also explored plasticity in form and decoration, though they rarely surpassed their continental peers in ostentation. The churches of Mariana and the Rosario at Ouro Preto are based on Borromini's vision of interlocking elliptical spaces. At São Pedro dos Clérigos, Recife), a conventional stucco-and-stone façade is enlivened by "a high scrolled gable squeezed tightly between the towers".

Even after the Baroque conventions passed out of fashion in Europe, the style was long practised in Brazil by [[Aleijadinho]], a brilliant and prolific architect in whose designs hints of Rococo could be discerned. His church of Bom Jesus de Matozinhos at Congonhas is distinguished by a picturesque silhouette and dark ornamental detail on a light stuccoed façade. Although Aleijadinho was originally commissioned to design São Francisco de Assis at São João del Rei, his designs were rejected, and were displaced to the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|church of São Francisco]] in Ouro Preto instead.

[[File:Gyoribencestemplom.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Széchenyi Square of [[Győr]], [[Hungary]]]]
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the first great Baroque building was the Jesuit Church of [[Trnava]] (today in [[Slovakia]]) built by Pietro Spozzo in 1629–37, modelling the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome. [[Jesuits]] were the main propagators of the new style with their churches in [[Győr]] (1634–1641), [[Košice]] (1671–1684), [[Eger]] (1731–1733) and [[Székesfehérvár]] (1745–1751). The reconstruction of the territories devastated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] was carried out in Baroque style in the 18th century. Intact Baroque townscapes can be found in [[Győr]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Eger]], [[Veszprém]], [[Esztergom]] and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]] of [[Buda]]. The most important Baroque palaces in Hungary were the [[Buda Castle|Royal Palace]] in Buda, [[Grassalkovich Palace]] in [[Gödöllő]], and [[Eszterháza|Esterházy Palace]] in [[Fertőd]]. Smaller Baroque edifices of the Hungarian aristocracy are scattered all over the country. Hungarian Baroque shows the double influence of Austrian and Italian artistic tendencies as many German and Italian architects worked in the country. The main characteristics of the local version of the style were modesty, lack of excessive decoration, and some "rural" flavour, especially in the works of the local masters. Important architects of the Hungarian Baroque were Andreas Mayerhoffer, Ignác Oraschek and Márton Wittwer. Franz Anton Pilgram also worked in the Kingdom of Hungary, for example on the great [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of [[Jászó|Jasov]] (today in [[Slovakia]]). In the last decades of the 18th century Neo-Classical tendencies became dominant. The two most important architects of that period were Melchior Hefele and [[Jakab Fellner]].

By the time Hungarian varieties of Baroque architecture appeared with several types of forms, shapes and decorations. Those that have become famous and nice, have been copied. That's why the Hungarian baroque edifices make groups based on similarities. The major kinds of buildings are the following: Eszterháza-type, Széchenyi-type, Gödöllő-type, religious (ecclesiastical) baroque, houses, and others (castles, peasant houses).

[[File:Château de Maisons-Laffitte 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Château de Maisons]] near Paris by [[François Mansart]] (1642)]]

The centre of Baroque secular architecture was France, where the open three-wing layout of the palace was established as the canonical solution as early as the 16th century. But it was the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] that determined the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take. For the first time, the [[corps de logis]] was emphasized as the representative main part of the building, while the side wings were treated as hierarchically inferior and appropriately scaled down. The medieval tower has been completely replaced by the central projection in the shape of a monumental three-storey gateway.

De Brosse's melding of traditional French elements (e.g. lofty [[mansard roof]]s and a complex roof-line) with extensive Italianate quotations (e.g. ubiquitous rustication, derived from [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]]) came to characterize the [[Louis XIII style]]. Probably the most accomplished formulator of the new manner was [[François Mansart]], a tireless perfectionist credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. In his design for [[Château de Maisons]] (1642), Mansart succeeded in reconciling academic and Baroque approaches, while demonstrating respect for the gothic-inherited idiosyncrasies of the French tradition.

[[File:Versailles Chapel - July 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Versailles's chapel as seen from the ''tribune royale'', an outstanding example of French Baroque&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Château of Maisons demonstrates the ongoing transition from the post-medieval [[chateau]]x of the 16th century to the villa-like country houses of the 18th. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each storey, mostly in [[pilaster]] form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation.

The next step in the development of European residential architecture involved the integration of the gardens in the composition of the palace, as is exemplified by [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]), where the architect [[Louis Le Vau]], the designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the gardener [[André Le Nôtre]] complemented one another. From the main cornice to a low plinth, the miniature palace is clothed in the so-called "colossal order", which makes the structure look more impressive. The creative collaboration of Le Vau and Le Nôtre marked the arrival of the "Magnificent Manner" which allowed to extend Baroque architecture outside the palace walls and transform the surrounding landscape into an immaculate mosaic of expansive vistas.

[[File:Les Invalides in Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Les Invalides]] in Paris by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1676)]]

The same three artists scaled this concept to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later main [[Palace of Versailles|residence at Versailles]]. On a far grander scale, the palace is an exaggerated and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century. [[Mannheim]], [[Nordkirchen]] and [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] were among many foreign residences for which Versailles provided a model.

The final expansion of Versailles was superintended by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], whose key design is the [[Dome des Invalides]], generally regarded as the most important French church of the century. Hardouin-Mansart profited from his uncle's instruction and plans to instill the edifice with an imperial grandeur unprecedented in the countries north of Italy. The majestic hemispherical dome balances the vigorous vertical thrust of the orders, which do not accurately convey the structure of the interior. The younger architect not only revived the harmony and balance associated with the work of the elder Mansart but also set the tone for Late Baroque French architecture, with its grand ponderousness and increasing concessions to [[academicism]].

The reign of [[Louis XV]] saw a reaction against the official [[Louis XIV Style]] in the shape of a more delicate and intimate manner, known as [[Rococo]]. The style was pioneered by [[Nicolas Pineau]], who collaborated with Hardouin-Mansart on the interiors of the royal [[Château de Marly]]. Further elaborated by [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Le Pautre]] and [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]], the "''genre pittoresque''" culminated in the interiors of the [[Château de Chantilly|Petit Château at Chantilly]] (c. 1722) and [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris (c. 1732), where a fashionable emphasis on the curvilinear went beyond all reasonable measure, while sculpture, paintings, furniture, and porcelain tended to overshadow architectural divisions of the interior.

==The Low Countries==

===Flanders and Belgium===
[[File:Leuven Sint-Michielskerk.jpg|thumb|Church of St. Michel in [[Leuven]], Belgium by [[Willem Hesius]] (1650)]]

Baroque architecture in the south, [[Flanders and Belgium]] developed rather differently from in the Protestant . After the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the Southern Netherlands remained in Catholic hands, ruled by the Spanish [[Habsburg]] Kings. Important architectural projects were set up in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In them, florid decorative detailing was more tightly knit to the structure, thus precluding concerns of superfluity. A remarkable convergence of Spanish, French, and Dutch Baroque aesthetics may be seen in the [[Abbey of Averbode]] (1667). Another characteristic example is the Church of St. Michel at [[Leuven|Louvain]], with its exuberant two-storey façade, clusters of half-columns, and the complex aggregation of French-inspired sculptural detailing.

Six decades later, a [[Flanders|Flemish]] architect, Jaime Borty Milia, was the first to introduce [[Rococo]] to Spain ([[Cathedral of Murcia]], west façade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, [[Ventura Rodríguez]], responsible for the dazzling interior of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] in [[Zaragoza]] (1750).

Some Flemish architects such as [[Wenceslas Cobergher]] were trained in Italy and their works were inspired by architects such as [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Cobergher's most major project was the Basilica of Our Lady of [[Scherpenheuvel-Zichem|Scherpenheuvel]] which he designed as the center of a new town in the form of a [[heptagon]].

The influence of the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on architecture was very important. With his book "I [[Palazzi di Genova]]" he introduced novel Italian models for the conception of profane buildings and decoration in the Southern Netherlands. The courtyard and portico of his own house in Antwerp ([[Rubenshuis]]) are good examples of his architectural activity. He also took part in the decoration of the Antwerp Jesuit Church (now [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]]) where he introduced a lavish Baroque decoration, integrating sculpture and painting in the architectural program.

===Northern Netherlands===
{{main article|Dutch Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam City Hall]] by [[Jacob van Campen]] (1646)]]
There is little Baroque about Dutch architecture of the 17th century. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch [[Palladianism]] is marked by sobriety and restraint. Two leading architects, [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]], used such eclectic elements as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples in a coherent combination that anticipated Wren's Classicism.

The most ambitious constructions of the period included the [[town hall|seats of self-government]] in [[Amsterdam]] (1646) and [[Maastricht]] (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the [[House of Orange]] are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, [[Huis ten Bosch]] and [[Mauritshuis]], are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the Stadholder's summer residence of [[Het Loo]].

The [[Dutch Republic]] was one of the [[great powers]] of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch colonial architecture, once flourishing in the [[Hudson River]] Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]].

== England ==
{{Main article|English Baroque|Edwardian Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Greenwich Hospital from Thames.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]] by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] (1694)]]

Baroque aesthetics, whose influence was so potent in mid-17th-century France, made little impact in England during [[the Protectorate]] and the first [[English Restoration|Restoration years]]. For a decade between the death of [[Inigo Jones]] in 1652 and [[Christopher Wren]]'s visit to Paris in 1665 there was no English architect of the accepted premier class. Unsurprisingly, general interest in European architectural developments was slight.

It was Wren who presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner, which differed from the continental models by a clarity of design and a subtle taste for classicism. Following the [[Great Fire of London]], Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches, where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views. His most ambitious work was [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France. In this majestically proportioned edifice, the [[Palladian]] tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium. Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture (e.g. by [[Thomas Archer]] in [[St. John's, Smith Square]], 1728).
[[File:England1 144.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]]]]

Although Wren was also active in secular architecture, the first truly Baroque [[English country houses|country house]] in England was built to a design by [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], starting in 1687. The culmination of Baroque architectural forms comes with Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. Each was capable of a fully developed architectural statement, yet they preferred to work in tandem, most notably at [[Castle Howard]] (1699) and [[Blenheim Palace]] (1705).

Although these two palaces may appear somewhat ponderous or turgid to Italian eyes, their heavy embellishment and overpowering mass captivated the British public, albeit for a short while. Castle Howard is a flamboyant assembly of restless masses dominated by a cylindrical domed tower which would not be out of place in [[Dresden]] or [[Munich]]. Blenheim is a more solid construction, where the massed stone of the arched gates and the huge solid portico becomes the main ornament. Vanbrugh's final work was [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724, the style had lost currency in Britain.

== Holy Roman Empire ==
{{Main article|Czech Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] in [[Berlin]]]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Baroque period began somewhat later. Although the [[Augsburg]] architect [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) and some theoretists, including [[Joseph Furttenbach the Elder]] already practiced the Baroque style, they remained without successors due to the ravages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. From about 1650 on, construction work resumed, and secular and ecclesiastical architecture were of equal importance. During an initial phase, master-masons from southern Switzerland and northern Italy, the so-called ''magistri Grigioni'' and the Lombard master-masons, particularly the [[Carlone]] family from Val d'Intelvi, dominated the field. However, Austria came soon to develop its own characteristic Baroque style during the last third of the 17th century. [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]] was impressed by [[Bernini]]. He forged a new ''Imperial'' style by compiling architectural motifs from the entire history, most prominently seen in his [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna. [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] also had an Italian training. He developed a highly decorative style, particularly in façade architecture, which exerted strong influences on southern Germany.

[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|right|250|[[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
Frequently, the Southern German Baroque is distinguished from the Northern German Baroque, which is more properly the distinction between the Catholic and the Protestant Baroque. In the Catholic South, the Jesuit church of [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]] was the first to bring Italian style across the Alps. However, its influence on the further development of church architecture was rather limited. A much more practical and more adaptable model of church architecture was provided by the Jesuit church in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]]): the wall-pillar church, a [[barrel-vault]]ed nave accompanied by large open chapels separated by wall-pillars. As opposed to St. Michael's in Munich, the chapels almost reach the height of the nave in the wall-pillar church, and their vault (usually transverse barrel-vaults) springs from the same level as the main vault of the nave. The chapels provide ample lighting; seen from the entrance of the church, the wall-pillars form a theatrical setting for the side altars. The wall-pillar church was further developed by the [[Vorarlberg]] school, as well as the master-masons of [[Bavaria]]. This new church also integrated well with the [[hall church]] model of the German late Gothic age. The wall-pillar church continued to be used throughout the 18th century (e.g. even in the early neo-classical church of [[Rot an der Rot Abbey]]), and early wall-pillar churches could easily be refurbished by re-decoration without any structural changes, such as the church at Dillingen.

[[File:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Interior of [[Vierzehnheiligen]] church in [[Bavaria]]]]
However, the Catholic South also received influences from other sources, such as the so-called ''radical Baroque'' of [[Bohemia]]. The radical Baroque of [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]], both residing at [[Prague]], was inspired by examples from northern Italy, particularly by the works of [[Guarino Guarini]]. It is characterized by the curvature of walls and intersection of oval spaces. While some Bohemian influence is visible in Bavaria's most prominent architect of the period, [[Johann Michael Fischer]] (the curved balconies of some of his earlier wall-pillar churches), the works of [[Balthasar Neumann]], in particular the [[Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen]], are generally considered to be the final synthesis of Bohemian and German traditions.

In the [[Slovene Lands]], especially in [[Carniola]], Baroque arrived in the first half of the 17th century mostly through Italian influences. [[Ljubljana]] emerged as an important regional center of Baroque architecture in the early 18th century, mostly with the work of northern Italian artists such as [[Andrea Pozzo]], [[Francesco Robba]], [[Carlo Martinuzzi]] and [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]]. Their work in the today's [[Slovenia]]'s capital incoporated many northern, especially Bohemian and Austrian elements, yet Slovenian baroque maintains a recognizably Italian touch to it.
[[Lower Styria]] was more influenced by various Austrian schools, especially [[Joseph Hueber]] and his pupils who built a number of manors in what is now eastern Slovenia.

[[File:Praha 2005-09-15 St Nicholas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[St. Nicholas Church (Prague)|Church of St Nicholas]], [[Lesser Town]], the most famous Baroque church in [[Prague]]]]
Protestant sacred architecture was of lesser importance during the Baroque, and produced only a few works of prime importance, particularly the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Dresden]]. Architectural theory was more lively in the north than in the south of Germany, with [[Leonhard Christoph Sturm]]'s edition of [[Nikolaus Goldmann]], but Sturm's theoretical considerations (e.g. on Protestant church architecture) never really made it to practical application. In the south, theory essentially reduced to the use of buildings and elements from illustrated books and engravings as a prototype.

Palace architecture was equally important both in the Catholic South and the Protestant North. After an initial phase when Italian architects and influences dominated ([[Vienna]], [[Rastatt]]), French influence prevailed from the second decade of the 18th century onwards. The French model is characterized by the horseshoe-like layout enclosing a cour d'honneur (courtyard) on the town side (chateau entre cour et jardin), whereas the Italian (and also Austrian) scheme presents a block-like villa. The principal achievements of German Palace architecture, often worked out in close collaboration of several architects, provide a synthesis of Austro-Italian and French models. The most outstanding palace which blends Austro-Italian and French influences into a completely new type of building is the [[Würzburg Residence]]. While its general layout is the horseshoe-like French plan, it encloses interior courtyards. Its façades combine Lucas von Hildebrandt's love of decoration with French-style classical orders in two superimposed stories; its interior features the famous Austrian "imperial staircase", but also a French-type [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms on the garden side, inspired by the "apartement semi-double" layout of French castles.

[[Ukrainian Baroque]] is an architectural style that emerged in Ukraine during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] era, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ukrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. One of the unique features of the Ukrainian baroque, were [[Onion dome|bud and pear-shaped domes]], that were later borrowed by the similar [[Naryshkin baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Власов В.Г.

[http://cih.ru/ae/af41.html  Нарышкинский стиль]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ukrainian Baroque buildings have been preserved, including several buildings in [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] and the [[Vydubychi Monastery]].
The best examples of [[Baroque painting]] are the church paintings in the [[Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra)|Holy Trinity Church]] of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of [[symbol]]ism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation.

In Russia, Baroque architecture passed through three stages—the early [[Naryshkin Baroque|Moscow Baroque]], with elegant white decorations on red-brick walls of rather traditional churches, the mature [[Petrine Baroque]], mostly imported from the Low Countries, and the late [[Rastrelli|Rastrelliesque Baroque]], which was, in the words of William Brumfield, "extravagant in design and execution, yet ordered by the rhythmic insistence of massed columns and Baroque statuary."

The first baroque churches were built in the estates of the [[Naryshkin]] family of Moscow [[boyar]]s. It was the family of [[Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina|Natalia Naryshkina]], [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s mother. Most notable in this category of small suburban churches were the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession in Fili]] (1693–96), the Holy Tritity church in Troitse-Lykovo (1690–1695) and the Saviour in Ubory (1694–97). They were built in red [[brick]] with profuse detailed decoration in white stone. The [[Bell tower|belfry]] was not any more placed beside the church as was common in the 17th century, but on the [[facade]] itself, usually surmounting the octagonal central church and producing daring vertical compositions. As the style gradually spread around [[Russia]], many monasteries were remodeled after the latest fashion. The most delightful of these were the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow, as well as [[Krutitsy]] [[metochion]] and Solotcha Cloister near [[Riazan]]. Civic architecture also sought to conform to the baroque aesthetics, e.g., the [[Sukharev Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and there is also a neo-form of this style like the [[State Historical Museum|Principal Medicine Store]] on [[Red Square]]. The most important architects associated with the Naryshkin Baroque were [[Yakov Bukhvostov]] and [[Peter Potapov]].

[[Petrine Baroque]] is a name applied by art historians to a style of Baroque architecture and decoration favoured by [[Peter the Great]] and employed to design buildings in the newly founded Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], under this monarch and his immediate successors. Unlike contemporaneous [[Naryshkin Baroque]], favoured in [[Moscow]], the Petrine Baroque represented a drastic rupture with Byzantine traditions that had dominated [[Russian architecture]] for almost a millennium. Its chief practitioners—[[Domenico Trezzini]], [[Andreas Schlüter]], and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]]—drew inspiration from a rather modest Dutch, Danish, and Swedish architecture of the time. Extant examples of the style in St Petersburg are the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], the [[Twelve Colleges]], the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Kikin Hall]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].The Petrine Baroque structures outside St Petersburg are scarce; they include the [[Menshikov Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Kadriorg Palace]] in [[Tallinn]].

[[File:Copenhagen amalienborg seen from opera house.jpg|thumb|[[Amalienborg Palace]], a Baroque quarter in the center of [[Copenhagen]]]]

During the golden age of the [[Swedish Empire]], the architecture of Nordic countries was dominated by the Swedish court architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] and his son [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger]]. Their aesthetic was readily adopted across the Baltic, in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].

Born in Germany, Tessin the Elder endowed Sweden with a truly national style, a well-balanced mixture of contemporary French and medieval Hanseatic elements. His designs for the royal manor of [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] seasoned French prototypes with Italian elements, while retaining some peculiarly Nordic features, such as the [[hip roof|hipped roof]] (''säteritak'').

Tessin the Younger shared his father's enthusiasm for discrete palace façades. His design for the [[Stockholm Palace]] draws so heavily on Bernini's unexecuted plans for the [[Louvre]] that one could well imagine it standing in Naples, Vienna, or Saint Petersburg. Another example of the so-called International Baroque, based on Roman models with little concern for national specifics, is the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The same approach is manifested is Tessin's polychrome domeless [[:File:Kalmarer Dom aussen.jpg|Kalmar Cathedral]], a skillful pastiche of early Italian Baroque, clothed in a giant order of paired Ionic pilasters.

It was not until the mid-18th century that Danish and Russian architecture were emancipated from Swedish influence. A milestone of this late period is [[Nicolai Eigtved]]'s design for a new district of [[Copenhagen]] centred on the [[Amalienborg Palace]]. The palace is composed of four rectangular mansions, originally owned by four of Denmark's greatest noble families, arranged across the angles of an octagonal square. The restrained façades of the mansions hark back to French antecedents, while their interiors contain some of the finest Rococo decoration in Northern Europe. Amalienborg Palace has served as the residence of the [[Danish royal family]] since the late 18th century.

[[Istanbul]], once the capital of the Ottoman Empire, hosts many different varieties of Baroque architecture.
As reforms and innovations to modernize the country came out in 18th and 19th century, various architecture styles were used in Turkey, one of them was the Baroque Style. As [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish architecture]] (which is also a combination of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]) combined with Baroque, a new style called Ottoman Baroque appeared.
Baroque architecture is mostly seen in mosques and palaces built in this centuries. The [[Ortaköy Mosque]], is one of the best examples of the Ottoman Baroque architecture.

The [[Tanzimat]] Era caused more architectural development. The architectural change continued with [[Sultan Mahmud II]], one of the most reformist sultans in Turkish History. One of his sons, [[Sultan Abdülmecid]] and his family left the [[Topkapı Palace]] and moved to the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which is the first European-style palace in the country.

Baroque architecture in Istanbul was mostly used in palaces near the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Golden Horn]]. [[Beyoğlu]] was one of the places that Baroque and other European style architecture buildings were largely used. The famous streets called [[Istiklal Avenue]], [[Nişantaşı]], [[Bankalar Caddesi]] consist of these architecture style apartments.
The Ottoman flavour gives it its unique atmosphere, which also distinguishes it from the later "colonial" Baroque styles, largely used in the Middle East, especially [[Lebanon]].
Later and more mature Baroque forms in Istanbul can be found in the gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which also has a very "eastern" flavour, combining Baroque, Romantic, and Oriental architecture.

It also includes the native [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] pictorial expression on modern Chilean territory.

==Pre-Columbian art==

{{Main article|Pre-Columbian art}}
[[File:MUseo LP 060 Valles Calchaquíes.JPG|thumb|Ceramics were the greatest artistic contribution of the northern peoples. These examples of [[Diaguita]] ceramics show this people’s fascination with geometric figures.]]
Prehistoric painting in Chile, also called pre-Columbian Chilean painting, refers to any type of painting or painting technique used to represent objects or people during the period before the Spanish conquest. Developed prior to the existence of written sources, study of this period is based on the material remains and vestiges of the cultures that developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/history346.html Artistic Cultures of Asia and the Americas - Pre-Columbian Art] www.all-art.org Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of pre-Columbian art in Chile coincided with the appearance of indigenous cultures in the territory, and ended around the start of the Spanish conquest of Chile around 1500AD. After this period, indigenous art was virtually eliminated by the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic]] community as part of the process of converting native people.
(see also: [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery]], [[Spanish missions in South America]]).

Prehistoric art is closely related to the [[cave painting]]s and [[petroglyph]]s developed
during the [[Pre-Columbian era|prehispanic]] period, especially in the extreme [[Norte Grande|North of Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precolombino.cl/recursos-educativos/arte-rupestre Recursos Educativos - Arte Rupestre] wwww.precolombino.cl Retrieved 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

Art historian [[:es:Luis Álvarez Urquieta|Luis Álvarez Urquieta]] was one of the first authors to raise the issue of pre-Columbian art in his book "Pintura en Chile" (Painting in Chile). The author explains that most of the painting developed before the arrival of the Spanish was done by the [[Atacama people|Atacameño]] and [[Mapuche|Araucano]] cultures, and also identified [[Diaguita]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] influences.
[[File:Selknam.jpg|thumb|left|Painted bodies of the [[Selknam people]], also called the Ona. You can see that in spite of the geographical distance between two different cultures (European and American), the reasons for creating art were the same: religious or social.]]

The use of art in this time could be aesthetic, practical, ritual or religious, depending on the culture and the resources available. Animal figures and symbols abound but images of people did not appear unless they were important or had some magical significance for the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rupestreweb.info/incacusco.html “Pinturas rupestres de posible afiliación inca, en el departamento del Cusco, Perú.”] Hostnig, Rainer. En www.rupestreweb.info/pinturarupestreinca.html, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Petroglifo atacama.jpg|thumb| Petroglyphs south of Atacama, Chile, near to the facilities of La Silla Observatory, [[Atacama Region]], northern Chile.]]
The cultural references varied depending on the area where the people lived.  Northern cultures, like the [[Diaguita]], preferred geometric figures and used pottery and [[petroglyph]]s extensively. The [[Mapuche]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingindigenous.org/index.php/es/territorio-mapuche/arte Arte Mapuche] www.beingindigenous.org Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; people, based in the centre of the modern Chilean territory, were more focused on the rituals performed by the [[machi (shaman)|machi]] (the Mapuche shamans), as well as their gods and deities. They developed colourful ritual textiles, used by the machi, and pottery specifically designed for use in burials.  Their designs did also include some northern influences.

In the far south, there is some evidence of petroglyph art but less than in the north. Notable among the southern cultures was the artwork of the [[Selknam people]], also known as Ona, who decorated their bodies as part of a religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter54/text-Fuego/Ona/text-Ona.htm The Ona (Selk'nam) People by George Weber] www.andaman.org George Weber, Last change March 1, 2007 Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingindigenous.org/index.php/en/other-regions/selknam-region/people Selk'nam People] www.beingindigenous.org Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, prehistoric native art throughout the [[Americas]] was almost entirely destroyed by the Spanish conquerors, and Chile did not escape this. Some remains were preserved in the north, where, thanks to the preservative qualities of the arid [[Atacama Desert]], certain objects of pictorial heritage value have survived preserved in time.

==Colonial art==

Chilean colonial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=26 Arte colonial en Chile] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; art refers to art produced in the Chilean colonial period that extended from 1598 AD to 1810 AD. The period saw a mixing of European techniques with native cultural heritage.

Artistically, the period began around the mid-17th century and was led at first by the [[Society of Jesus|Spanish Jesuits]] and by working artisans who lacked specialized artistic training. It was directly influenced by European artistic trends such as [[Mannerism]] and [[Baroque]], but, like all other Chilean culture that developed during this period, it was also influenced by native art and culture, creating a new style.
Art was seen as vital for the education and religious conversion of the indigenous people and played an important role in the transmission of Spanish dominance and Catholic world vision.
[[File:Anónimo - Inmaculada Concepción, c. 1680.JPG|thumb|left| The Immaculate Conception (Anonymous), produced about 1680. Currently the “Day of the Immaculate Conception” is celebrated on December 8 in Chile. It is noteworthy that the first paintings in Chile were almost entirely related to religion, with painting seen as a tool for educating and evangelizing the indigenous people.]]

===History===

Colonial painting developed in a time when South American countries were not politically or geographically grouped as they are today and had not yet formed national identities, art and cultural individuality. Just as it is difficult for historians to define the indigenous art of each country, because there were no geographical demarcations or pictorial characteristics endemic to the modern territories, it is also difficult to speak precisely of Peruvian, Argentinian or Chilean colonial art.
Some countries, like Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, had their own art schools where local artists could work and study. Chile did not, however, because it did not represent a major interest for the Spanish government, so it relied on importing pieces from foreign art schools.

Overall, colonial painting in Chile and across all Latin America was influenced by Spanish art, which taught the anatomical study of bodies, the [[chiaroscuro]] style, and subjects clothed in aristocratic attire. For the Spanish conquerors, craft and artisan work was seen as demeaning and antithetical to nobility, so they chose to leave this work to the “[[mestizo]]s” and native peoples, instead importing and admiring European art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldandsold.com/articles22/spanish-painting-2.shtml Characteristics Of Spanish Painting] www.oldandsold.com Originally Published 1917 Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to art historian [[:es:Luis Álvarez Urquieta|Luis Álvarez Urquieta]], Spanish painting of the time incorporated Asian influences as a result of Spanish trade with the far east. It is from here, he claims, that Spanish painting inherited its color palette, the expressionless faces of its subjects, and the profusion of golden shades. The same author also emphasizes the influence of indigenous people on Chilean art, which can be seen in the simplicity of the composition of religious scenes, as well as local traditions, customs and mannerisms represented in the paintings.
[[File:Virgen dolorosa.jpg|thumb|The Virgin of Sorrow. The collector and art historian Luis Álvarez Urquieta, believed that this painting was the first made by any artist in Chilean territory. The influence of the Quito school is noticeable, it shows the abnormal distribution of forms and the artist's lack of knowledge of perspective. This is partly because most of the painters of the time were not professional but amateur.]]

In the opinion of Álvarez Urquieta, technical skill was somewhat neglected in early colonial painting, with more importance given to the objects being painted and their educational use. Most American colonial painting shows a lack of study of light and shade and poor use of perspective and proportion, though it has been praised for its liveliness and use of colour, as well as its documentary value in representing the social integration of the Spanish and American peoples.

Art historians Ivelíc and Galaz &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0014654 “La Pintura en Chile Desde la Colonia hasta 1981” Gaspar Galaz and Milan Ivelić] www.memoriachilena.cl&lt;/ref&gt; agree that painting in the early Americas lost some of the academic rigor and technique of Europe in the process of mixing with native styles, as Álvarez Urquieta has also claimed.

===Main influences===

;Jesuit influences

[[File:Gaspar Miguel de Berrío - Patrocinio de San José, 1744.jpg|thumb|left|There are not many colonial art museums, because of the small number of works produced during these years. However, the Society of Jesus, faithful to their artistic tradition, stored some old pictures on the walls of their monasteries, churches and convents.]]

Chilean artists primarily focused on religious themes, which were most in demand and therefore more lucrative. Religious paintings tended to be displayed in churches, cloisters and convents - their logical destination, considering that the majority were commissioned by members of the church or as donations to the church. They are known for their lack of facial expression and proportion in their portrayal of human figures, and the lack of interest they show for subjects like landscape or nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000216 THE JESUITS IN COLONIAL AMERICA: 1565–1767] www.larramendi.es Nicolas P. Cushner, Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society of Jesus|Compañía de Jesús]] (Jesuits) were one of the most influential religious groups, contributing to the expansion of the fine arts throughout Latin America as well as the monastic educational tradition.
The Jesuits were among the first to teach the native peoples European artistic techniques and worked to preserve the symbolism of the Christian artistic legacy. They also provided excellent conditions for the preservation of artwork (in churches,
cloisters, etc.), until they were [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelled from the Latin American territories]] by the Spanish authorities.&lt;ref name=Lacoste&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-23762004000200005&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es La vid y el vino en América del Sur: el desplazamiento de los polos vitivinícolas (siglos XVI al XX)] www.scielo.cl ©       	 2013 Instituto de Estudios Humanísticos "Juan Ignacio Molina" Universidad de Talca, Retrieved March 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuits promoted and developed skills such as clock making, [[carpentry]], [[silversmith]]ing, sculpture and portrait painting. One such skilled Jesuit was [[:es:Ignacio Andía y Varela|Ignacio Andía y Varela]], who would later sculpt the Spanish coat of arms that now sits upon [[Santa Lucía Hill|Cerro Santa Lucía]] hill in Santiago, among other works.

Many of the colonial artworks preserved until present day by the Jesuits are found in their churches, such as the high altar at the [[San Francisco Church, Santiago de Chile]] which holds the ''Virgen Dolorosa''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Chile/Region_Metropolitana_de_Santiago/Santiago-1558248/Things_To_Do-Santiago-Iglesia_De_San_Francisco-BR-1.html Iglesia De San Francisco, Santiago] www.virtualtourist.com Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (Virgin of Sorrow, 1576), one of the first colonial paintings ever produced in Chile.

San Francisco Church also holds another of the most important paintings of the period, the ''Genealogía de los Franciscanos'' (Genealogy of the [[Franciscan]]s), an oil of over four meters length and width. The canvas has 644 small portraits, crowned by the Virgin Mary, and reads: "For the honour and glory of our Lord and the Holy Mother Church, this tree of the religion is dedicated to the parents of the order." The artist who produced the work is anonymous, as decreed by the Jesuit code of humility, with only the date the work was finished included in the signature. Another notable Jesuit painting is the ''Mesa de la Cena'' (Supper Table, 1652), five meters high by three meters wide, which was formerly hung in the sacristy of [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago|Santiago Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biografiadechile.cl/detalle.php?IdContenido=1179&amp;IdCategoria=16&amp;IdArea=290&amp;status=S&amp;TituloPagina=Historia%20de%20Chile&amp;pos=5 Franciscanos, Historia de Chile: La Colonia. Dominicos, Franciscanos y Jesuitas] biografiadechile.cl Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One important Jesuit artist was the Bavarian monk [[:es:Carlos Haymhausen|Carlos Haymhausen]], who arrived in Chile in the mid-18th century. The monk was a great lover of the arts and, along with Ambrosio Santelices and Fermin Morales, he is one of the first professional painters recorded in the former Chilean territory. The historian Uriqueta viewed Haymhausen as a model for future generations of painters because, in addition his own talent as an artist, he brought with him other foreign artists who would pave the future of Chile’s national art.
 [[File:Pintura colonial.jpg|thumb|left| The Casa del Arte gallery in Concepción keeps examples Chilean of colonial painting. Note that the paintings are anonymous according to the custom of the Society of Jesus.]]
;Quito School
The “Escuela Quiteña”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/arte-quiteno-colonial--0/html/00281534-82b2-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_19.html#I_0_ Arte Quiteño Colonial] www.cervantesvirtual.com José María Vargas Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Quito School]]) was also influential in the colonial period. Ever since the conquest of the Americas, [[Quito]], Ecuador had attracted a large number of artists from Europe, contributing to the founding of an important school that would influence art across Latin America, including Chile.

The school was founded by Franciscan monks in Quito and was deeply religious. The most important painter from this school is [[:es:Miguel de Santiago|Miguel de Santiago]], considered one of the most noteworthy painters of the entire colonial period. Miguel de Santiago raised Latin American painting to a higher level, leaving behind a great number of fine paintings.
[[File:Virgen alada del Apocalípsis Miguel de Santiago.jpg|thumb| ''Winged Virgin of the Apocalypse'' by [[:es:Miguel de Santiago|Miguel de Santiago]], one of the leading exponents of the [[Quito School]] of the seventeenth century, and an important influence on the Chilean art of the time.]]
[[File:Retrato de una señora principal con su negra esclava por Vicente Albán.jpg|thumb|left|Quito lady, portrayed with her black slave. [[Vicente Alban]], 18th century.]]

However, the greatest Quito pieces tended to be kept by the artistic patrons of Ecuador and Peru and few filtered through to Chile. According to the historian Álvarez Uriqueta, Chile’s Spanish rulers did not have the resources to spend on art, preoccupied as they were with Chile’s extreme geography and defiant [[Mapuche]] people, who continued to fight the conquistadors throughout the colonial period. Because of this, while the influence of Quito school is undeniable in Chile, it is not as strong as in other Latin American countries.

;European influences
During the government of [[Isabella I of Castile]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctspanish.com/legends/isabella1.htm Queen Isabella I] ctspanish.com Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/historia-de-la-vida-y-hechos-del-emperador-carlos-v--2/html/ Historia de la vida y hechos del emperador Carlos V] www.cervantesvirtual.com Carlos Seco Serrano Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in Spain, art was considered a vital tool for the religious conversion and education of the people in Spain’s conquered territories in the Americas. The prevailing artistic style at the time was the [[Mannerism]], which represented the Christian ideals of the age.

However, as wealthy Europeans began to commission portraits of themselves and their families, reducing their donations to the church, this decreased the production of religious art in Europe and its Latin American territories during the 18th century. Painting of aristocratic origin stopped being a tool for social change and education and started to become a symbol of wealth.

[[Flemish painting|The Flemish School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/209989/Flemish-art |title=Flemish art|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|website= www.britannica.com|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its use of [[Chiaroscuro]], also influenced colonial art in Chile. Among its exponents were the Italian painters [[Angelino Medoro]], [[Bernardo Bitti]] and [[Mateo Perez de Alessio]] who brought the first engravings and religious prints to Chile.

===Legacy===

The colonial period marked a profound change in Chilean art from the previous pre-Columbian period, with a concerted effort to eliminate the vestiges of the pagan culture that existed prior to the conquest. However,  pre-Columbian painting survived due to the process of integration that occurred during this period, whereby the symbols and customs found expression in colonial work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profesorenlinea.cl/artes/Arte_colonial_en_Chile.htm Arte colonial en Chile] www.profesorenlinea.cl Retrieved March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, the colonial period is considered to end with the appearance of [[José Gil de Castro]], an important painter of Peruvian origin, which began the tradition of the traveling painters in Chile.

The paintings and sketches created by these artists were, and continue to be, important in helping to understand, in a didactical way, the early years of republican existence, and are a graphic documentation of the battles that occurred during the country's independence and conflicts with neighbouring countries.
[[File:Escudo de Chile.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean Coat of Arms, designed by [[Charles Wood Taylor.]]]]
According to the authors Ivelíc and Galaz, this artistic period should not be referred to as a "generation" or a "movement" as the precursors of Chilean painting did not form a group. They are related only in a chronological sense as they arrived in the country in close succession of one another.

;History

The beginning of the independence revolution forced Chilean art into the background for a short period. However, soon after the process of independence began, various foreign artists came to Chile on scientific expeditions and to make documentaries, bringing with them their tastes and thematic frameworks, that would go on to influence the future direction of Chilean painting.

This process created the initial signs of Chilean nationality and the consequent ideas of Chilean style. However, this originality would not be clearly recognisable in Chile until well into the 19th century.
The concept of “Pintores viajeros del siglo XIX” (Traveller-Artists of the 19th century)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrimoniochileno.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=389:origenes-de-las-artes-plasticas-en-chile&amp;catid=44:pintura&amp;Itemid=37 Orígenes de las Artes Plásticas en Chile] www.patrimoniochileno.net Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was created by historian Luis Álvarez Urquieta, referring to the group of painters who arrived independently of one another in Chile towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century. There is a big difference between the style and themes of colonial art and those of this particular period, which lasted until approximately the 19th century. The latter was more varied and rich, ranging from portraits of famous people by artists such as [[José Gil de Castro]] and [[Raymond Monvoisin]] to the representation of folkloric scenes of independence by the Chilean [[Manuel Antonio Caro]] and the German [[Johann Moritz Rugendas|Mauricio Rugendas]], [C1] to scientific and bibliographic representation of plants, animals and cities by [[Claude Gay|Claudio Gay]], [[Charles Thorold Wood]] and the scientist [[Charles Darwin]].
[[File:Abdicación de O´higgins.jpg|thumb|left| The Abdication of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] by [[Manuel Antonio Caro]]. The work represents the moment when O'Higgins was forced to resign his office]]

Painting in the previous period was characterised by its functionality in the task of evangelisation and education. The new trend, however, appreciated art for its intrinsic aesthetic importance, and in this way, painting was no longer regarded as a complement to other arts and science and gained its own value.

Chilean art suffered through the civil conflict, and it is very difficult to identify a particular trend or style from that era. During the period of the traveller-artists, [[realism (arts)|realism]], [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]] coexisted without overshadowing one another, except in some cases where certain styles prevailed but for short periods only.

Chronologically speaking, this was a period of profound upheaval in Chilean art. While at the beginning artists maintained a [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] Italian style, at the end of the fight for independence, [[romanticism]] became more popular as a technique among the patriotic and wealthy circles, which then give way to realism, a style that would prevail until 1840.

==Foreign Precursors of Chilean painting==
[[File:Carga de O'Higgins.jpg|thumb|right|The Charge of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] at the Battle of Rancagua, by [[Pedro Subercaseaux]].]]
Among historians, it is established that the beginning of the arrival of foreign artists to Chile is marked by the arrival of the [[Peru]]vian artist [[José Gil de Castro]]. The popular painter was dedicated to painting portraits of the leaders of the revolution against the Spanish, such as [[Ramón Freire]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Isabel Riquelme]], [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolivar]]. His technique largely resembles the [[Cuzco School]] so his portrayal of faces was not particularly accurate, appearing flat and lacking in expression. Regardless of his skill as a portrait painter, the decorative details of his work are appreciated by [[Ricardo Bindis]] in his book ''History of Chilean Painting'', who praises the way the artist treated the medals and other details present on the [[Caudillos]] and Revolution leaders’ outfits.
 [[File:Antonio Smith, Crepúsculo marino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Smith (artist)|Antonio Smith]], Crepúsculo marino (Ocean Twilight)]]
Another foreign painter of great importance to the newly formed nation was [[Charles Thorold Wood|Charles Wood]], an English painter who specialised in nautical scenes and contributed a large collection of paintings of remarkable historical value. Among his most famous works are ''Naufragio del Arethusa'' (Shipwreck of Arethusa) ''Toma de la fragata Esmeralda por la Escuadra de Chile de Lord Cochrane'' (The Capture of the [[Esmeralda (1791)|Frigate Emerald]] by the Chilean Fleet of [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]]) and ''El General Baquedano en Campaña'' (General Baquedano on Campaign). According to literature, Charles Wood personally witnessed the capture of the Esmeralda frigate and he later created several reproductions of this scene. He is also credited with the design of the national coat of arms of Chile, an important contribution to the Chilean Republic.

Both the German artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas|Mauricio Rugendas]] and the French artist [[:es:Ernesto Charton de Treville|Ernesto Charton de Treville]] had an important role in portraying the typical customs of the country. Their travel through Chile produced many pictorial scenes of the birth of the newly formed republic. Among the most popular works of these artists, we find ''Fiesta campestre'' (Country Festival), ''La Batalla de Maipu'' (Battle of Maipu), and ''El huaso y la lavandera'' ([[Huaso]] and the Laundress) from Rugendas; and ''Plaza de Armas de Santiago'' (Central Square of Santiago) and ''La Casa de la Moneda'' ([[La Moneda Palace|House of La Moneda]]) from Charton. Both artists are examples of travelling painters who documented what they saw.
[[File:Valparaíso Charton de Treville.jpg|thumb|right|Valparaíso, by [[:es:Ernesto Charton de Treville|Ernesto Charton de Treville]]]]
One of the most renowned painters in Chile was French artist [[Raymond Monvoisin]], the pioneer of the portrait in Chile. His work focused on the representation of the top aristocrats of his time, most notably ''Carmen Alcalde y Velasco Cazotte'', General and President [[Manuel Bulnes]], [[Mariano Egaña]] and Venezuelan politician [[Andrés Bello]] who became a Chilean national. The French artist popularised portrait painting within the Chilean elite; his direct disciples were [[Francisco Javier Mandiola]] and [[Jose Manuel Ramirez Rosales]] who inherited much of his technique and his colour schemes as well as a fascination with French culture. Mandiola, unlike Rosales and Monvoisin, preferred to portray peasants, children and homeless people, depicting the lower Chilean classes. Monvoisin was asked several times to assume the role of Director at the Academy of Fine Arts which the government looked to found but the artist had refused on several occasions previously, before [[:es: Alejandro Ciccarelli|Alejandro Ciccarelli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=374 Alejandro Ciccarelli Biography] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  finally took the position.

==Chilean Precursors of Chilean painting==

[[File:Arturo Prat por Manuel Antonio Caro.jpg|thumb| right| [[Arturo Prat]], Chilean lawyer and navy officer, by [[Manuel Antonio Caro]]]]

The Chilean precursors of Chilean painting were, like their foreign contemporaries working in Chile, influenced by European art. The Chilean painters of this generation, like their predecessors, did not share a particular style but were active during the same period. However, they were all instrumental in introducing a new era of Chilean art with the creation of the Chilean Academy of Painting. Galaz and Ivaelic wrote that “they share the proximity of their painting with the soil, men and costumes of Chile”.
; Some of the Chilean painters forming part of this movement:
*[[Manuel Antonio Caro]] = Considered the most remarkable Chilean painter of this period, his style was realistic and portrayed customs and folkloric scenes. Among his most famous paintings are “La [[Zamacueca]]” and “The Abdication of O’Higgins”. Caro would also become a member of the new academy.

===Legacy===

During this period, the aristocracy developed a taste for fine art, leaving behind the lack of technical precision in art which had defined colonial times.
The national artists still did not gain their own clear identity during this period, however, as painting remained dedicated predominantly to portraits, nature and representing the most important historical events. Historians Galaz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=849 Gaspar Galaz Biography] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Ivelic wrote that while Europe discovered America during the 15th century, America did not look at Europe until the beginning of the 19th century, explaining the Americans’ fascination with European art in this period.

The end of this artistic era was marked by the founding of the new Chilean Academy of Painting in 1849, which allowed artists to study in Chile for the first time rather than having to travel to Europe. Although the Chilean Academy did not see the fruits of its labour until well into the 19th century, its importance for Chilean art become noticeable in the generation labelled by [[:es: Antonio Rodríguez Romera|Antonio Romera]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=900 Antonio Romera Biography (1908–1975)] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as the "Generación del medio siglo" (mid-century generation).

==Chilean Academy of Painting==
[[File:Vista Santiago desde Peñalolén.jpg|thumb | right| Vista de [[Santiago]] desde [[Peñalolén]] (View of Santiago from Peñalolen) by [[:es: Alejandro Ciccarelli|Alejandro Ciccarelli]], the first director of the Chilean Academy of Painting]]

The Chilean Academy of Painting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=27 Academia de Pintura] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was the first institution to teach art professionally in Chile. It opened on 17 March 1849 and was sponsored by the government of [[Manuel Bulnes]] as part of a state plan to promote fine art and other intellectual activities to the young Chilean population. In this period, the [[University of Chile]] (1842) was also founded along with the School of Arts and Crafts (1849), the Conservatory of Music (1850) and architecture and sculpture classes at the University of Chile, under the direction of French architect François Brunet Debaines and French sculptor Auguste François respectively.  The academy was originally located in the building belonging to the San Felipe University, in what is today the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]]. Various changes led the academy to merge with the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes ([[Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts]]) in 1910, and then later to hand its administration over to the University of Chile in 1932.
[[File:Paisaje, óleo del pintor chileno Antonio Smith.jpg|thumb|left|Landscape in oil by the Chilean [[:es: Antonio Smith|Antonio Smith]]]]
The academy would produce the country’s first national artists. It would be the starting point for some of the most prominent Chilean painters, including the four great masters of Chilean painting (Pedro Lira, Juan Francisco González, Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma and Alberto Valenzuela Llanos), their pupils, and also the future “[[Generación del 13]]” (13 Generation). The academy’s first directors were the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] artist [[:es: Alejandro Ciccarelli|Alejandro Ciccarelli]]; the German artist [[Ernesto Kirchbach]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Juan Mochi]]; [[Cosme San Martín]], the first Chilean to hold this position; and the Chilean sculptor [[:es: Virginio Arias|Virginio Arias]].
[[File:"Escena de playa con figura".jpg|thumb|right|''Escena de playa con figura'' (Beach Scene with Figure) by Pedro Lira]]
With the establishment of the Academy of Painting, under the direction of Ciccarelli, came the first attempt at the unification and creation of a unique national style, with the academy promoting a neoclassical style. In Europe, academies focused on uniformity, establishing fixed and strict rules to ensure “the true art” followed a straight path. The Chilean academies tried to implement this idea using French methodology.
To begin with, courses consisted of three classes. The first class was “Studies of heads, extremities and the human form”, the second was “Sculpture”, and the third, “Life drawing, natural attire and anatomy”. Later, after the Academy joined forces with the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera|National Institute]], courses were extended and more teachers were taken on due to the growing number of students.

===Critics of the Academy===

Despite the significance of the Academy, some art historians criticised this period as one of the dullest in the history of Chilean art. These authors based their criticism on Ciccarelli’s attempt to copy the European model of teaching. In Europe, teachers were plentiful and the continent had vast art collections and plentiful patrons to draw upon. In contrast, Chile had only recently began its foray in the art world and was a country with almost no native art movement or established national identity, as well as a very modest national art collection, with people unable to afford fine art. The attempt to bring the European model to Chile by replicating its techniques has been seen as a failure in terms of the number of artists produced, especially for Ciccarelli, who presided over the academy for over 20 years.
[[File:Laguna+de+aculeo+onofre+jarpa.jpg|thumb| left|Laguna de acúleo (Acúleo Lagoon) by [[:es:Onofre Jarpa|Onofre Jarpa]]]]

In the words of the art historian [[:es: Antonio Rodríguez Romera|Antonio Romera]], Ciccarelli was:
"A dogmatic master, inflexible in defence of his aesthetic ideal, lacking the necessary ductility and eclecticism to allow students to follow their own path: that marked out by their own sensibility; by vocation; their intimate stimulation..."
The same author states that Ciccarelli was unable to create the following and discipleship of his teachings that he wished for. Instead, his most successful students, such as [[Pedro Lira]] and [[Antonio Smith (artist)|Antonio Smith]], did not care for his teachings and migrated towards other styles and workshops of their own.

Pedro Lira also agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=307 www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; that with these criticisms of Ciccarelli. In the mid-19th century, the Chilean aristocrat possessed little artistic knowledge inherited from the “Precursors of Chilean painting". The complicated nature of his teaching, his over-ambitious neoclassical pretensions, and his lack of flexibility earned him criticism from several of his students, but it also created a new appetite for [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painting in Chile.

===Students of Ciccarrelli (1849–1869)===

The outdated neoclassical style developed by Ciccarelli and imposed on his students is manifested in themes which had never been seen before in Chilean painting, like mythology, ancient history and the [[Classics]].
Some of his students resisted his teachings, the most prominent being Pedro Lira and Antonio Smith, who, independent of their studies at the academy, developed their own style and gained great recognition.
The following are some of the most noteworthy of Ciccarelli’s students:
[[File:Río Cachapoal.jpg|thumb|"Rio Cachapoal" (Cachapoal River), by Antonio Smith. Smith, disappointed with Ciccarelli’s academic rigidity, decided to form his own art workshop to teach landscape painting. Outstanding Chilean artists like Valenzuela Puelma, Lira, Orrego Luco and Pedro León Carmona studied simultaneously with Smith and Ciccarelli, demonstrating that the Academy was not the only place able to teach art in Chile.]]

Lira is the first and best-known of the four great masters of Chilean painting. Historians like Romera consider him part of the "mid-century generation."

In 1859, under the direction of Ciccarelli, the Academy became the School of Fine Arts at the University of Chile, merging with the architecture and sculpture classes already on offer there. During the same year, a new government decree reorganised and divided the sculpture course into two different sections, statues and monuments. In 1869, after 20 years, the Italian finally left his position, leaving the door open for the German [[:de:Ernst Kirchbach|Ernesto Kirchbach]]. Kirchbach imposed a very strict academic teaching style and a new style for his pupils - [[romanticism]].

===Legacy===

During this period, everything that had given Chilean art its identity before the establishment of the Academy - pre-Columbian art; the educational and socially unifying efforts of colonial art; and the eclecticism of the period of the travelling artists - was lost.

The academy, and therefore painting and sculpture, became a privilege for the upper classes, with pictures that could only be understood by having already seen the work of the European masters.

For historians, this meant that while the early years of the academy saw the first effort made in Chile to improve the quality of the arts, they were also a springboard for several independent artists who tired of academic dogmatism and started to look elsewhere for new styles, techniques and inspiration.

The Academy left a legacy of students who awoke in society an intellectual interest in Chilean art, with groups like "The 13 Generation" and "The Great Chilean Masters" formed mostly by Academy students. Many of the works produced at the academy are now in the hands of private collectors, but are also displayed in Chilean museums and public spaces throughout the country.

==The Great Chilean Masters==

 [[File:Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma - Coquetería.jpg|thumb|right|''Coquetería'' (Coquetry) by Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma]]

The art historian Antonio Romera highlights the four most prominent and important painters in the development of Chilean art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries:

*[[Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=389 Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma Biography in spanish] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pedro Lira]]
*[[Alberto Valenzuela Llanos]]
*[[Juan Francisco González]]

First generation students of the Academy, the four refined their artistic technique in France and took on the role of ‘master’ for other art students. At some point they all moved away from the academy in order to adopt new trends. Despite having deep aesthetic and stylistic differences, they were contemporaries of one another and would have known each other.

While the work of [[Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma]] and [[Pedro Lira]] can be classified as [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalist]], [[Alberto Valenzuela Llanos]] and [[Juan Francisco González]] adopted new modern trends. Some historians, such as Gaspar and Ivelic, also chose to add the artist Alfredo Helsby to the list of the Masters, but there is no absolute consensus on this.

The [[Generación del 13|13 Generation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=29 Generacion del 13] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl retrieved July 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was Chile’s first true artistic group or movement. They got their name from a joint exhibition held in 1913 in the offices of the Chilean newspaper [[El Mercurio]]. The group was characterised by a fascination with pre-Columbian art and customs, social critique and the portrayal of a group of people never seen before in Chilean painting: the working class.
As with the founders of Romanticism, they were bohemian but engaged in work of a more social nature. With most of them coming from humble beginnings, they made little money from painting and mostly lived in poverty, causing many to die young from diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

The 13 Generation emerged from the country's poorest neighbourhoods. Initially, its members studied with Pedro Lira and were influenced by the Spaniard [[Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza|Álvarez de Sotomayor]], who, in turn, inherited a similar style to [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]].

This group is also known as the “Centenary Generation” or “Centenary Group” because some of its members unveiled their paintings at the International Exposition of 1910. They were also sometimes called “The Tragic Generation” because of the bohemian and miserable life that led many to a very early grave. [[Pablo Neruda]] called them a “heroic captaincy of painters” in recognition of the effort to portray the life of the working classes and the customs of the [[Mapuche]] people.

== The Montparnasse Group ==

The Montparnasse Group was a Chilean art collective, formed in 1922 by artists strongly influenced by the European trends of [[Post-Impressionism]], especially the works of Paul Cézanne, and [[Fauvism]].

The group took their name from a visit to France, where they stayed in the Parisian neighbourhood of [[Montparnasse]], a social hub for the art avant-garde. During this visit, they met the Spanish artist [[Juan Gris]] (José Victoriano González-Pérez) and took part in the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1920.

Apart from Post-Impressionism and Fauvism trends, the group were also influenced by other styles such as expressionism and cubism, but these had a lesser effect on their style. The group expressed their opposition to academic art and romantic ''[[Criollismo]]'' imposed in Chile at that time.

==The 40 Generation==

The group of artists who graduated in 1940 became known by this name&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=63 Generacion del cuarenta (40 Generation)] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; after the exhibition at the ''Salón oficial'' (The Official Salon) in 1941. The exhibition was a contest organised by the executive committee of the Museum of Fine Arts, and was open to both Chilean and foreign artists, as long as their pieces were created in Chile. This contest began on 15 November each year during the Chilean spring.

The group is characterised by their affinity with [[Impressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and their command of drawing and harmonious composition. They are also known for remaining disassociated from the political agitation affecting the country during this period and instead focusing exclusively on art.

Members of this generation included: Augusto Barcia, Ana Cortés, Ximena Cristi, Manuel Gómez Hassan, Sergio Montecino, Fernando Morales Jordán, Eduardo Ossandón, Francisco Otta, Arturo Pacheco Altamirano, Carlos Pedraza, Tole Peralta, Maruja Pinedo, Aída Poblete, Inés Puyo, Israel Roa, Reinaldo Villaseñor and Hardy Wistuba.

==Grupo Signo (Sign Group)==

This group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=68 Grupo Signo (Sign Group)] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was formed by Alberto Pérez, Gracia Barrios, José Balmes and Eduardo Martínez Bonati with the motto “create a casual and instinctive art”. They introduced a new form of art which focused on achieving a new visual style, giving importance to the artistic materials themselves, disregarding the representation and portrayal of subjects, and expanding the concept of painting. This resulted in the abandonment of the traditional [[Easel|easel painting]]. The four artists were selected, along with Patricio Valenzuela and Carlos Ortúzar, to participate in the Second Youth Biennial of Paris in 1961, and they consolidated as a group in 1962, when they took part in the Darro Gallery exhibition in Madrid under the name “Sign Group”.

==Escena de avanzada (Vanguard Scene)==

This name was given by the art critic and theorist [[Nelly Richard]] to a diverse group of artists from various disciplines, whose main characteristic and aim was to modify the artistic dialogue of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=69 Escena de avanzada (A Vanguard Scene)] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This scene, or movement, produced artists who, from 1977 to 1982, were against the institutions imposed by the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|military government]] at the time.

They shared a desire to create new visual languages (as had the Sign Group) under the tenets of conceptual art and a questioning attitude to the media and to other contemporary groups. Artists forming part of the Vanguard Scene included: Carlos Altamirano, Juan Castillo, Eugenio Dittborn, Diamela Eltit, Carlos Gallardo, Carlos Leppe, Gonzalo Mezza, Ximena Prieto, Lotty Rosenfeld, Francisco Smythe and the poet Raúl Zurita.

==CADA Group==

CADA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=72 CADA Group] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is an acronym which stands for ''Colectivo Acción de Arte'' (Collective Art Action). They made bold public interventions in the late 70s and early 80s. The group was formed by the writer [[Diamela Eltit]], the poet [[Raúl Zurita]], the sociologist Fernando Balcells and the visual artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo and reacted artistically to the institutions of the time. According to the American critic Robert Neustatt, CADA represented the political opposition of the time and became critics of the media.

==Promoción 80 (80s Prom)==

 [[File:Declaration of Love.jpg|thumb|left|''Declaracion de Amor'' (Declaration of Love)]]

''Promoción 80'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/generacion.aspx?itmid=73 Promoción 80 (80s Prom)] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or Eighties Prom, was a group of artists from varied backgrounds and schools whose work was introduced onto the national scene during the 1980s. It was characterised by the search for new artistic languages and was linked with the German [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] trend.

The group mainly included students who graduated from the [[University of Chile]]’s School of Art in 1979. They held a joint exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 1980, entitled ''Promotion 80'', under the curatorship of Milan Ivelic. The following artists took part in the exposition: Jorge Tacla, [[Samy Benmayor]], Omar Gatica, Ismael Frigerio, Rodrigo Pascal, Victoria Calleja, Mamy Ussui and Álvaro Cortés.

Other artists considered exponents of this generation are: Patricia Figueroa, [[Carlos Maturana |Carlos Maturana (Bororo)]], Carlos Bogni and Eva Lefever. There were also other artists who were not from the University of Chile’s School of Art - like the self-taught Pablo Domínguez and Gonzalo Ilabaca, the sculptor and architect Ivan Daiber, and the painter Ignacio Valdés from Catholic University of Santiago - who were also considered members of this group.

==The 90s==

Unlike their predecessors, the artists of this decade seemed to lack identity, or at least a common identity. There is no unifying element such as an aesthetic or political orientation that brings them together under one theme.

Their works can be classified as [[Neo-Pop]], [[Realism (arts)|realistic]], [[Abstract art|abstract]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], ethnic and graphic, capturing multiple, loosely connected themes.

In 2004, an exhibition called ''The Lost Generation: Decade of the 90s'' brought together some of the artists that represented the decade. The exhibition was organized by the painter Jorge Gonzales Lohse and was held in a shopping mall in the south of Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=1246 Agustín Abarca Biography] www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales Lohse, who also curated the exhibition, highlighted three main reasons for the diverse or eclectic identity of Chilean art in the 90s: the return to democracy; the emerging art market; and the opening of new art schools in recently created universities. "The 90s saw the emergence of an art with a commercial purpose within a highly structured system," Gonzalez Lohse is quoted as saying in the PortaldeArte.cl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portaldearte.cl/agenda/mixta/2004/pintura_chilena2.htm "The Lost Generation: Decade of the 90s"] www.portaldearte.cl Amigos del arte 2004, Retrieved April 04, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claës Fredrik Hornstedt''' (12 February 1758 [[Linköping]] – May 1809 [[Helsinki]]) was a Swedish naturalist, taxonomist, botanical illustrator and a protégé of [[Carl Peter Thunberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://balticworlds.com/in-the-spirit-of-linnaeus-and-the-footsteps-of-thunberg-the-last-research-voyage/ Baltic Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornstedt received a thorough education in natural history at the [[University of Uppsala]]. His 1781 dissertation dealt with plants collected in Japan by his teacher and mentor, Thunberg. At the invitation of Thunberg he set off in 1783 for [[Jakarta|Batavia]], capital of the Dutch colonial empire, from Göteborg, boarding the “Sophia Magdalena”, a ship belonging to the [[Swedish East India Company]]. Supported by the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, he began collecting natural history specimens, mounted expeditions to the interior and neighbouring islands, and learnt the [[Malay language]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. His letters show a growing disaffection with the European way of life and its prodigality. He wore Chinese clothing, ate Chinese food and frequented the Chinese quarter.

Hornstedt left [[Java]] in August 1784, suffering the after-effects of malaria and jaundice, but even so managed to return with an impressive collection of natural history and ethnological objects. His collection also contained a set of medical drawings based on a Japanese medical text. These drawings were given to him by [[Isaac Titsingh]] who had come back to Batavia after his second trip to the East India Company's Station at [[Dejima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostindiskakompaniet.se/personbeskrivning/hornstedt-fredrik-claes/ Swedish East India Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

After brief visits to the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Denmark]] in 1786, he studied for a degree in medicine at the German [[University of Greifswald]]. Once back in Sweden he was appointed counselor and lecturer in Natural History at the museum in Linköping in 1787. He enlisted in the Swedish navy in 1796, and became a prisoner of war in the [[Finnish War|Swedish-Russian War]] of 1808. He then became head physician at a Russian [[lazaret]] on [[Suomenlinna]] fortress.

|colspan=6|Coxeter notation expresses [[Coxeter group]]s as a list of branch orders of a [[Coxeter diagram]], like the [[polyhedral groups]], {{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}} = [p,q]. [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral groups]], {{CDD|node|2|node|n|node}}, can be expressed a product [ ]×[n] or in a single symbol with an explicit order 2 branch, [2,n].

In [[geometry]], '''Coxeter notation''' (also '''Coxeter symbol''') is a system of classifying [[symmetry group]]s, describing the angles between fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]] in a bracketed notation expressing the structure of a [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]], with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and has been more comprehensively defined by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]].

== Reflectional groups==
{{Further information|Point group}}

For [[Coxeter group]]s, defined by pure reflections, there is a direct correspondence between the bracket notation and [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The numbers in the bracket notation represent the mirror reflection orders in the branches of the Coxeter diagram. It uses the same simplification, suppressing 2s between orthogonal mirrors.

The Coxeter notation is simplified with exponents to represent the number of branches in a row for linear diagram. So the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; group is represented by [3&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;], to imply ''n'' nodes connected by ''n-1'' order-3 branches. Example ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents diagrams {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}}.

Coxeter initially represented bifurcating diagrams with vertical positioning of numbers, but later abbreviated with an exponent notation, like [...,3&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;p,q,r&lt;/sup&gt;], starting with [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node|splitsplit1|branch3|node}} or  {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|nodes}} as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Coxeter allowed for zeros as special cases to fit the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; family, like ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2,2&lt;/sup&gt;], like {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node|3|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3a|nodea|3a|nodea}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3ab|nodes}}.

Coxeter groups formed by cyclic diagrams are represented by parenthesese inside of brackets, like [(p,q,r)] = {{CDD|pqr}} for the [[triangle group]] (p q r). If the branch orders are equal, they can be grouped as an exponent as the length the cycle in brackets, like [(3,3,3,3)] = [3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}} or {{CDD|branch|3ab|branch}}. {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|branch}} can be represented as [3,(3,3,3)] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

More complicated looping diagrams can also be expressed with care. The [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram#Ranks 4.E2.80.9310|paracompact Coxeter group]] {{CDD|node|split1|branch|split2|node}} can be represented by Coxeter notation [(3,3,(3),3,3)], with nested/overlapping parentheses showing two adjacent [(3,3,3)] loops, and is also represented more compactly as [3&lt;sup&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing the [[rhombus|rhombic symmetry]] of the Coxeter diagram. The paracompact complete graph diagram {{CDD|tet}} or  {{CDD|branch|splitcross|branch}}, is represented as [3&lt;sup&gt;[3,3]&lt;/sup&gt;] with the superscript [3,3] as the symmetry of its [[regular tetrahedron]] coxeter diagram.

The Coxeter diagram usually leaves order-2 branches undrawn, but the bracket notation includes an explicit '''2''' to connect the subgraphs. So the Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|3|node|2|node|3|node}} = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented by [3]×[3] = [3]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [3,2,3]. Sometimes explicit 2-branches may be included either with a 2 label, or with a line with a gap: {{CDD|node|3|node|2x|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|3|2|3|node|3|node}}, as an identical presentation as [3,2,3].

For the affine and hyperbolic groups, the subscript is one less than the number of nodes in each case, since each of these groups was obtained by adding a node to a finite group's diagram.

== Subgroups ==
Coxeter's notation represents rotational/translational symmetry by adding a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator outside the brackets, [X]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which cuts the order of the group [X] in half, thus a index 2 subgroup. This operator implies an even number of operators must be applied, replacing reflections with rotations (or translations). When applied to a Coxeter group, this is called a '''direct subgroup''' because what remains are only direct isometries without reflective symmetry.

The '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators can also be applied inside of the brackets, like [X,Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [X,(Y,Z)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and creates '''"semidirect" subgroups''' that may include both reflective and nonreflective generators. Semidirect subgroups can only apply to Coxeter group subgroups that have even order branches adjacent to it. Elements by parentheses inside of a Coxeter group can be give a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator, having the effect of dividing adjacent ordered branches into half order, thus is usually only applied with even numbers. For example, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [4,(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}). 

If applied with adjacent odd branch, it doesn't create a subgroup of index 2, but instead creates overlapping fundamental domains, like [5,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [5/2], which can define doubly wrapped polygons like a [[pentagram]], {5/2}, and [5,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] relates to [[Schwarz triangle]] [5/2,3,3], [[polytope density|density]] 2.

Groups without neighboring '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements can be seen in ringed nodes Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for [[uniform polytope]]s and honeycomb are related to ''hole'' nodes around the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements, empty circles with the alternated nodes removed. So the [[snub cube]], {{CDD|node_h|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and the [[snub tetrahedron]], {{CDD|node|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and a [[demicube]], h{4,3} = {3,3} ({{CDD|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node_1|3|node|3|node}}) has symmetry [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3] ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node_h0|4|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|nodes|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}).

Note: [[Pyritohedral symmetry]] {{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} can be written as {{CDD|node|4|2|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, separating the graph with gaps for clarity, with the generators {0,1,2} from the Coxeter group {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, producing pyritohedral generators {0,12}, a reflection and 3-fold rotation. And chiral tetrahedral symmetry can be written as  {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} or  {{CDD|node_h2|2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {12,0120}.

Johnson extends the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operator to work with a placeholder 1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nodes, which removes mirrors, doubling the size of the fundamental domain and cuts the group order in half.&lt;ref name="subgroups2"&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 255, halving subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; In general this operation only applies to individual mirrors bounded by even-order branches. The '''1''' represents a mirror so [2p] can be seen as [2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p], or [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], like diagram {{CDD|node|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|2x|p|node_c3}}, with 2 mirrors related by an order-2p dihedral angle. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c3}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c3}}, or in bracket notation:[1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p, &lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [p].

Each of these mirrors can be removed so h[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1] = [1,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p], a reflective subgroup index 2. This can be shown in a Coxeter diagram by adding a &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symbol above the node: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node}} = {{CDD|node|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch}}.

If both mirrors are removed, a quarter subgroup is generated, with the branch order becoming a gyration point of half the order: 
:q[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a rotational subgroup of index 4. {{CDD|node_h2|2|2x|p|2|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h0}} =  {{CDD|labelp|branch_h2h2}}.

For example, (with p=2): [4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] = [2] = [&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;], order 4. [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 2.

The opposite to halving is doubling&lt;ref name="subgroups"/&gt; which adds a mirror, bisecting a fundamental domain, and doubling the group order.
: {{Brackets|p}} = [2p]

Halving operations apply for higher rank groups, like [[tetrahedral symmetry]] is a half group of [[octahedral group]]: h[4,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3], removing half the mirrors at the 4-branch. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate all connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c1|3|node_c2}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c1|split2|node_c2}}, h[2p,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,3] = [(p,3,3)].

If nodes are indexed, half subgroups can be labeled with new mirrors as composites. Like {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}, generators {0,1} has subgroup {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, generators {1,010}, where mirror 0 is removed, and replaced by a copy of mirror 1 reflected across mirror 0. Also given {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2}, it has half group {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node_n1|3|node_n2|3|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0}}, generators {1,2,010}.

Doubling by adding a mirror also applies in reversing the halving operation: {{Brackets|3,3}} = [4,3], or more generally {{Brackets|(q,q,p)}} = [2p,q].

=== Radical subgroups ===
[[File:43-radial subgroups.png|thumb|A radical subgroup is similar to an alternation, but removes the rotational generators.]]
Johnson also added an [[asterisk]] or star '''*''' operator for "radical" subgroups&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 259, radical subgroup&lt;/ref&gt;, that acts similar to the &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; operator, but removes rotational symmetry. The index of the radical subgroup is the order of the removed element.  For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2]. The removed [3] subgroup is order 6 so [2,2] is an index 6 subgroup of [4,3].

The radical subgroups represent the inverse operation to an [[#Extended symmetry|extended symmetry]] operation. For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], and in reverse [2,2] can be extended as [3[2,2]] ≅ [4,3]. The subgroups can be expressed as a Coxeter diagram: {{CDD|node_c1|4|node|3s|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|4|node_x|3|node_x}} ≅ {{CDD|nodeab_c1|2|node_c1}}. The removed node (mirror) causes adjacent mirror virtual mirrors to become real mirrors.

If [4,3] has generators {0,1,2}, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], index 2, has generators {0,12}; [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] ≅ [3,3], index 2 has generators {010,1,2}; while radical subgroup [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], index 6, has generators {01210, 2, (012)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}; and finally [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3*], index 12 has generators {0(12)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;0, (012)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;01}.

A '''trionic subgroup''' is an index 3 subgroups. There are many
Johnson defines a ''trionic subgroup'' with operator ⅄, index 3. For rank 2 Coxeter groups, [3], the trionic subgroup, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] is [ ], a single mirror. And for [3''p''], the trionic subgroup is [3''p'']&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [''p'']. Given {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_n1}}, with generators {0,1}, has 3 trionic subgroups. They can be differentiated by putting the ⅄ symbol next to the mirror generator to be removed, or on a branch for both: [3''p'',1&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_trionic}} = {{CDD|node_n0|p|3_n1|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0|2_n1}},  {{CDD|node_trionic|3x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, and [3''p''&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|3trionic|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|3_n1|node_n0|2_n1}} with generators {0,10101}, {01010,1}, or {101,010}.

[[#Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry|Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry]]: [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], relating the symmetry of the [[regular tetrahedron]] and [[tetragonal disphenoid]].

For rank 3 Coxeter groups, [''p'',3], there is a trionic subgroup [''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [''p''/2,''p''], or {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|3trionic|node_n2}} = {{CDD|2_n2|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n2|p|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}. For example the finite group [4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [2,4], and Euclidean group [6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [3,6], and hyperbolic group [8,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [4,8]. 

An odd-order adjacent branch, ''p'', will not lower the group order, but create overlapping fundamental domains. The group order stays the same, while the [[density (polytope)|density]] increases. For example the [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3], of the regular polyhedra [[icosahedron]] becomes [5/2,5], the symmetry of 2 regular star polyhedra. It also relates the hyperbolic tilings {p,3}, and [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Hyperbolic_star-tilings|star hyperbolic tilings]] {p/2,p} 

For rank 4, [''q'',2''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2''p'',((p,q,q))], {{CDD|node|q|node|2x|p|node|3trionic|node}} = {{CDD|labelq|branch|split2-pq|node|2x|p|node}}. 

For example [3,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,3,3], or {{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2|3trionic|node_n3}} = {{CDD|2_n3|2_n2|node_n1|3_n2|3_n3|3|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2,3} in [3,4,3] with the trionic subgroup [4,3,3] generators {0,1,2,32123}. For hyperbolic groups, [3,6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [6,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;], and [4,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,4,4].

[[File:33-trionic subgroups.png|thumb|Trionic relations of [3,3]]]
Johnson identified two specific '''trionic subgroups'''&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 258, trionic subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; of [3,3], first an index 3 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], with [3,3] ({{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}} = {{CDD|node|split1|branch|label2}}) generators {0,1,2}. It can also be written as [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)] ({{CDD|node|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}) as a reminder of its generators {02,1}. This symmetry reduction is the relationship between the regular [[tetrahedron]] and the [[tetragonal disphenoid]], represent a stretching of a tetrahedron perpendicular to two opposite edges.

Secondly he identifies a related index 6 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; or [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}), index 3 from [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {02,1021}, from [3,3] and its generators {0,1,2}.

These subgroups also apply within larger Coxeter groups with [3,3] subgroup with neighboring branches all even order.
[[File:334 trionic subgroups2.png|thumb|Trionic subgroup relations of [3,3,4]]]
For example, [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4], and [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] are subgroups of [3,3,4], index 2, 3 and 6 respectively. The generators of [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2,4}} ≅ [8,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,8], order 128, are {02,1,3} from [3,3,4] generators {0,1,2,3}. And [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4}}, order 64, has generators {02,1021,3}. As well, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4].

Also related [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] has trionic subgroups: [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], order 64, and 1=[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [[4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 32.

=== Central inversion===
[[File:Point Reflection.png|thumb|A 2D central inversion is a 180 degree rotation, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
A [[central inversion]], order 2, is operationally differently by dimension. The group [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents ''n'' orthogonal mirrors in n-dimensional space, or an [[n-flat]] subspace of a higher dimensional space. The mirrors of the group [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] are numbered {{tmath|0 \dots n-1}}. The order of the mirrors doesn't matter in the case of an inversion. The matrix of a central inversion is {{tmath|-I}}, the Identity matrix with negative one on the diagonal.

From that basis, the central inversion has a generator as the product of all the orthogonal mirrors. In Coxeter notation this inversion group is expressed by adding an alternation &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to each 2 branch. The alternation symmetry is marked on Coxeter diagram nodes as open nodes.

A [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] can be marked up with explicit 2 branches defining a linear sequence of mirrors, open-nodes, and shared double-open nodes to show the chaining of the reflection generators.

For example, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] and [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are subgroups index 2 of [2,2], {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}, and are represented as {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2|node}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|node}}) and {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}) with generators {01,2} and {0,12} respectively. Their common subgroup index 4 is [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and is represented by {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}), with the double-open {{CDD|node_h4}} marking a shared node in the two alternations, and a single [[rotoreflection]] generator {012}.

=== Rotations and rotary reflections ===
Rotations and [[rotary reflection]]s are constructed by a single single-generator product of all the reflections of a prismatic group, [2''p'']×[2''q'']×... where [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'',...)=1, they are isomorphic to the abstract [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''n''=2''pq''.

The 4-dimensional double rotations, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), which include a central group, and are expressed by Conway as ±[C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2003, p.46, Table 4.2 Chiral groups II&lt;/ref&gt;, order 2''pq''. From Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|2|node_n2|2x|q|node_n3}}, generators {0,1,2,3}, the single generator of [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}} is {0123}. The half group, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or cyclc graph, [(2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)], {{CDD|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h4|2x}} expressed by Conway is [C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;], order ''pq'', with generator {01230123}.

If there is a common factor ''f'', the double rotation can be written as {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), generator {0123}, order 2''pqf''. For example, ''p''=''q''=1, ''f''=2, {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is order 4. And {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, generator {01230123}, is order ''pqf''. For example {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is order 2, a [[central inversion]].

=== Commutator subgroups ===
Simple groups with only odd-order branch elements have only a single rotational/translational subgroup of order 2, which is also the [[commutator subgroup]], examples [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. For other Coxeter groups with even-order branches, the commutator subgroup has index 2&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where c is the number of disconnected subgraphs when all the even-order branches are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter and Moser, 1980, Sec 9.5 Commutator subgroup, p. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [4,4] has three independent nodes in the Coxeter diagram when the '''4'''s are removed, so its commutator subgroup is index 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and can have different representations, all with three '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or [(4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)]. A general notation can be used with +''c'' as a group exponent, like [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Example subgroups ===

==== Rank 2 example subgroups ====
[[Dihedral symmetry]] groups with even-orders have a number of subgroups. This example shows two generator mirrors of [4] in red and green, and looks at all subgroups by halfing, rank-reduction, and their direct subgroups. The group [4], {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1}} has two mirror generators 0, and 1. Each generate two virtual mirrors 101 and 010 by reflection across the other.

==== Rank 3 Euclidean example subgroups ====
The [4,4] group has 15 small index subgroups. This table shows them all, with a yellow fundamental domain for pure reflective groups, and alternating white and blue domains which are paired up to make rotational domains. Cyan, red, and green mirror lines correspond to the same colored nodes in the Coxeter diagram. Subgroup generators can be expressed as products of the original 3 mirrors of the fundamental domain, {0,1,2}, corresponding to the 3 nodes of the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}. A product of two intersecting reflection lines makes a rotation, like {012}, {12}, or {02}. Removing a mirror causes two copies of neighboring mirrors, across the removed mirror, like {010}, and {212}. Two rotations in series cut the rotation order in half, like {0101} or {(01)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}, {1212} or {(02)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}. A product of all three mirrors creates a [[transreflection]], like {012} or {120}.

{{See also|Goursat tetrahedron#Extended symmetry}}

Coxeter's notation includes double square bracket notation, {{Brackets|X}} to express [[automorphism|automorphic]] symmetry within a Coxeter diagram. Johnson added alternative of angled-bracket &lt;[X]&gt; or {{langle}}[X]{{rangle}} option as equivalent to square brackets for doubling to distinguish diagram symmetry through the nodes versus through the branches. Johnson also added a prefix symmetry modifier [Y[X]], where Y can either represent symmetry of the Coxeter diagram of [X], or symmetry of the fundamental domain of [X].

For example, in 3D these equivalent [[rectangle]] and [[Rhombus|rhombic]] geometry diagrams of &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt;: {{CDD|branch|3ab|3ab|branch}} and {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}}, the first doubled with square brackets, {{Brackets|3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;}} or twice doubled as [2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with [2], order 4 higher symmetry. To differentiate the second, angled brackets are used for doubling, {{langle}}[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}} and twice doubled as {{langle}}2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}}, also with a different [2], order 4 symmetry. Finally a full symmetry where all 4 nodes are equivalent can be represented by [4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with the order 8, [4] symmetry of the [[Square (geometry)|square]]. But by considering the [[tetragonal disphenoid]] fundamental domain the [4] extended symmetry of the square graph can be marked more explicitly as [(2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4)[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]].

Further symmetry exists in the cyclic &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; and branching &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; diagrams. &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; has order 2''n'' symmetry of a regular ''n''-gon, {''n''}, and is represented by [''n''[3&lt;sup&gt;[''n'']&lt;/sup&gt;]]. &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt; are represented by [3[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3] and [3[3&lt;sup&gt;2,2,2&lt;/sup&gt;]] respectively while &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; by [(3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,3,4,3], with the diagram containing the order 24 symmetry of the regular [[tetrahedron]], {3,3}. The paracompact hyperbolic group &lt;math&gt;{\bar{L}}_5&lt;/math&gt; = [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node|branch3|splitsplit2|node|split1|nodes}}, contains the symmetry of a [[5-cell]], {3,3,3}, and thus is represented by [(3,3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3,3,3].

An [[asterisk]] * superscript is effectively an inverse operation, creating ''radical subgroups'' removing connected of odd-ordered mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Norman W. Johnson, Asia Ivić Weiss, ''Quaternionic modular groups'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 295, Issues 1–3, 1 July 1999, Pages 159–189 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002437959900107X]&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at generators, the double symmetry is seen as adding a new operator that maps symmetric positions in the Coxeter diagram, making some original generators redundant. For 3D [[space group]]s, and 4D point groups, Coxeter defines an index two subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}, {{Brackets|X|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which he defines as the product of the original generators of [X] by the doubling generator. This looks similar to {{Brackets|X}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the chiral subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}. So for example the 3D space groups {{Brackets|4,3,4}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (I432, 211) and {{Brackets|4,3,4|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} (Pm{{overline|3}}n, 
223) are distinct subgroups of {{Brackets|4,3,4}} (Im{{overline|3}}m, 229).

== Computation with reflection matrices as symmetry generators ==

A Coxeter group, represented by [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|q|node_n2}}, is given Coxeter notation [p,q] for the branch orders. Each node in the Coxeter diagram represents a mirror, by convention called ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The ''generators'' of this group [p,q] are reflections: ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotational subsymmetry is given as products of reflections: By convention, σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/p, and σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a rotation of angle π/q, and σ&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/2.

[p,q]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|3|q|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, is an index 2 subgroup represented by two rotation generators, each a products of two reflections: σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and representing rotations of π/''p'', and π/''q'' angles respectively.

With one even branch, [''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2x|q|node_n2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2|2x|q|node_n2}}, is another subgroup of index 2, represented by rotation generator σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, and reflectional ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

With even branches, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}}, is a subgroup of index 4 with two generators, constructed as a product of all three reflection matrices: By convention as: ψ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;1,2,0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are [[rotary reflection]]s, representing a reflection and rotation or reflection.

In the case of affine Coxeter groups like {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, or {{CDD|node_n0|infin|node_n1}}, one mirror, usually the last, is translated off the origin. A [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] generator τ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix T&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) is constructed as the product of two (or an even number of) reflections, including the affine reflection. A [[transreflection]] (reflection plus a translation) can be the product of an odd number of reflections φ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;), like the index 4 subgroup {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|4|node_h4|4|node_h2}}.

Another composite generator, by convention as ζ (and matrix Z), represents the [[Inversion in a point|inversion]], mapping a point to its inverse. For [4,3] and [5,3], ζ = (ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;h/2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h'' is 6 and 10 respectively, the [[Coxeter number]] for each family. For 3D Coxeter group [p,q] ({{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}}), this subgroup is a rotary reflection [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

Coxeter groups are categorized by their rank, being the number of nodes in its [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The structure of the groups are also given with their abstract group types: In this article, the abstract [[dihedral group]]s are represented as ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[cyclic group]]s are represented by ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 2 ===
Example, in 2D, the Coxeter group [p] ({{CDD|node|p|node}}) is represented by two reflection matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, The cyclic symmetry [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) is represented by rotation generator of matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 3 ===
The finite rank 3 Coxeter groups are [1,''p''], [2,''p''], [3,3], [3,4], and [3,5].

To reflect a point through a plane &lt;math&gt;ax + by + cz = 0&lt;/math&gt; (which goes through the origin), one can use &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}-2\mathbf{NN}^T &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the 3x3 identity matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the three-dimensional [[unit vector]] for the vector normal of the plane.  If the [[L2 norm]] of &lt;math&gt;a, b,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is unity, the transformation matrix can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \left [\begin{smallmatrix} 1 - 2 a^2  &amp; - 2 a b &amp; - 2 a c \\ - 2 a b  &amp; 1 - 2 b^2 &amp; - 2 b c  \\ - 2 a c &amp; - 2 b c &amp; 1 - 2c^2 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

==== Dihedral symmetry====
The reducible 3-dimensional finite reflective group is [[dihedral symmetry]], [''p'',2], order 4''p'', {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|2|node_n2}}. The reflection generators are matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Identity. [''p'',2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2|2x|node_h2}}) is generated by 2 of 3 rotations: S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt;. An order ''p'' [[rotoreflection]] is generated by V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, the product of all 3 reflections.

The simplest irreducible 3-dimensional finite reflective group is [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [3,3], order 24, {{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|3|node_n2}}. The reflection generators, from a D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; construction, are matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Rank one groups==
{{Further information|One-dimensional symmetry group}}
In one dimension, the ''bilateral group'' [&amp;nbsp;] represents a single mirror symmetry, abstract ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2. It is represented as a [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] with a single node, {{CDD|node}}. The ''[[identity group]]'' is the direct subgroup [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry order 1. The '''+''' superscript simply implies that alternate mirror reflections are ignored, leaving the identity group in this simplest case. Coxeter used a single open node to represent an alternation, {{CDD|node_h2}}.

[[File:Regular hexagon symmetries2.png|400px|thumb|A regular [[hexagon]], with markings on edges and vertices has 8 symmetries: [6], [3], [2], [1], [6]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with [3] and [1] existing in two forms, depending whether the mirrors are on the edges or vertices.]]
In two dimensions, the ''[[rectangle|rectangular]] group'' [2], abstract ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ], being the product of two bilateral groups, represents two orthogonal mirrors, with Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node}}, with [[Order (group theory)|order]] 4. The '''2''' in [2] comes from linearization of the orthogonal subgraphs in the Coxeter diagram, as {{CDD|node|2x|node}} with explicit branch order 2. The ''rhombic group'', [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), half of the rectangular group, the [[point reflection]] symmetry, Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, order 2.

Coxeter notation to allow a '''1''' place-holder for lower rank groups, so [1] is the same as [ ], and [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as [ ]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h2}}.

The ''full p-gonal group'' [p], abstract ''[[dihedral group]]'' D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, ([[Nonabelian group|nonabelian]] for p&gt;2), of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2''p'', is generated by two mirrors at angle ''π''/''p'', represented by Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|p|node}}. The ''p-gonal'' subgroup [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[cyclic group]]'' ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''p'', generated by a rotation angle of&amp;nbsp;''&amp;pi;''/''p''.

Coxeter notation uses double-bracking to represent an [[automorphism|automorphic]] ''doubling'' of symmetry by adding a bisecting mirror to the [[fundamental domain]]. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[p]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; adds a bisecting mirror to [p], and is isomorphic to [2p].

In the limit, going down to one dimensions, the ''full [[apeirogon]]al group'' is obtained when the angle goes to zero, so [∞], abstractly the [[infinite dihedral group]] D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, represents two parallel mirrors and has a Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|infin|node}}. The ''[[One-dimensional symmetry group#Translational symmetry|apeirogonal group]]'' [∞]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|infin|node_h2}}, abstractly the infinite [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the ''additive group'' of the [[integers]], is generated by a single nonzero translation.

In the hyperbolic plane, there is a ''full [[pseudogon]]al group'' [''iπ/λ''], and ''pseudogonal subgroup'' [''iπ/λ'']&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|ultra|node_h2}}. These groups exist in regular infinite-sided polygons, with edge length λ. The mirrors are all orthogonal to a single line.

In three dimensions, the ''full orthorhombic group'' or ''orthorectangular'' [2,2], abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Order (group theory)|order]] 8, represents three orthogonal mirrors, (also represented by Coxeter diagram as three separate dots {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}). It can also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ]×[ ], but the [2,2] expression allows subgroups to be defined:

First there is a "semidirect" subgroup, the ''orthorhombic group'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4.  When the '''+''' superscript is given inside of the brackets, it means reflections generated only from the adjacent mirrors (as defined by the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}) are alternated. In general, the branch orders neighboring the '''+''' node must be even. In this case [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] represent two isomorphic subgroups that are geometrically distinct. The other subgroups are the ''pararhombic group'' [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), also order 4, and finally the ''[[Point reflection|central group]]'' [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}) of order 2.

Next there is the ''full ortho-''p''-gonal group'', [2,p] ({{CDD|node|2|node|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4p, representing two mirrors at a [[dihedral angle]] π/''p'', and both are orthogonal to a third mirror. It is also represented by Coxeter diagram as {{CDD|node|p|node|2|node}}.

The direct subgroup is called the para-''p''-gonal group, [2,p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2p, and another subgroup is [2,p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, also of order 2p.

The ''full gyro-p-gonal group'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4''p''. The gyro-''p''-gonal group, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2''p'' is a subgroup of both [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] and [2,2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

The [[polyhedral group]]s are based on the symmetry of [[platonic solid]]s: the [[tetrahedron]], [[octahedron]], [[cube]], [[icosahedron]], and [[dodecahedron]], with [[Schläfli symbol]]s {3,3}, {3,4}, {4,3}, {3,5}, and {5,3} respectively. The Coxeter groups for these are: [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}}), [3,5] ({{CDD|node|3|node|5|node}}) called full [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [[octahedral symmetry]], and [[icosahedral symmetry]], with orders of 24, 48, and 120.
[[File:Pyritohedral in icosahedral symmetry.png|thumb|[[Pyritohedral symmetry]], [3+,4] is an index 5 subgroup of [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3].]]
In all these symmetries, alternate reflections can be removed producing the rotational tetrahedral [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), octahedral [3,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h2}}), and icosahedral [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|5|node_h2}}) groups of order 12, 24, and 60. The octahedral group also has a unique index 2 subgroup called the [[pyritohedral symmetry]] group, [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|node}}), of order 12, with a mixture of rotational and reflectional symmetry. Pyritohedral symmetry is also an index 5 subgroup of icosahedral symmetry: {{CDD|node_n0|5|node_n1|3|node_n2}} --&gt; {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|4|node_h2|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, with virtual mirror '''1''' across '''0''', {010}, and 3-fold rotation {12}.

The tetrahedral group, [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), has a doubling {{Brackets|3,3}} (which can be represented by colored nodes {{CDD|node_c1|3|node_c2|3|node_c1}}), mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, and this produces the [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_c2|3|node_c1|4|node}}) group. The subgroup [3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|3|node|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3], and [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{See|List of planar symmetry groups}}

In the Euclidean plane there's 3 fundamental reflective groups generated by 3 mirrors, represented by Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|node|4|node|4|node}}, {{CDD|node|6|node|3|node}}, and {{CDD|node|split1|branch}}, and are given Coxeter notation as [4,4], [6,3], and [(3,3,3)]. The parentheses of the last group imply the diagram cycle, and also has a shorthand notation [3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

{{Brackets|4,4}} as a doubling of the [4,4] group produced the same symmetry rotated π/4 from the original set of mirrors.

Direct subgroups of rotational symmetry are: [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [6,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [(3,3,3)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] and [6,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are semidirect subgroups.

== Complex reflections==
[[File:Rank2_shephard_subgroups3.png|thumb|All subgroup relations on rank 2 Shephard groups.]]
Coxeter notation has been extended to [[Complex vector space|Complex space]], C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where nodes are [[unitary reflection]]s of period greater than 2. Nodes are labeled by an index, assumed to be 2 for ordinary real reflection if suppressed. [[Complex reflection group]]s are called [[Shephard group]]s rather than [[Coxeter group]]s, and can be used to construct [[complex polytope]]s.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^1&lt;/math&gt;, a rank 1 shephard group {{CDD|pnode}}, order ''p'', is represented as &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[], []&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; or ]&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[. It has a single generator, representing a 2''&amp;pi;''/''p'' radian rotation in the [[Complex plane]]: &lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Coxeter writes the rank 2 complex group, &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; represents [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|pnode|3|q|3|rnode}}. The ''p'' and ''r'' should only be suppressed if both are 2, which is the real case [''q'']. The order of a rank 2 group &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;g = 8/q(1/p+2/q+1/r-1)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, 9.7 Two-generator subgroups reflections. pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' is 2,3,4,...), &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[8]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[5]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[10]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|pnode|4|node}}, {{CDD|3node|3|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|6|node}}, {{CDD|3node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|4node|3|4node}}, {{CDD|3node|8|node}}, {{CDD|4node|6|node}}, {{CDD|4node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|5|3node}}, {{CDD|5node|3|5node}}, {{CDD|3node|10|node}}, {{CDD|5node|6|node}}, {{CDD|5node|4|3node}}.

{{Jesus |expanded=in culture}}

No useful description of the physical appearance of Jesus is given in the [[New Testament]] and the '''depiction of Jesus''' in pictorial form was [[Aniconism in Christianity|controversial]] in the [[early Church]].&lt;ref name=Irenaeus1&gt;Philip Schaff commenting on Irenaeus, wrote, 'This censure of images as a Gnostic peculiarity, and as a heathenish corruption, should be noted'. Footnote 300 on Contr. Her. .I.XXV.6. ANF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elvira36&gt;[[Synod of Elvira]], 'Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration', AD 306, Canon 36&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of him in art took several centuries to reach a conventional standardized form for his physical appearance, which has subsequently remained largely stable since that time. Most images of [[Jesus]] have in common a number of traits which are now almost universally associated with Jesus, although variants are seen.

The conventional image of a fully bearded Jesus with long hair emerged around 300 AD, but did not become established until the 6th century in [[Eastern Christianity]], and much later in the West.  It has always had the advantage of being easily recognizable, and distinguishing Jesus from other figures shown around him, which the use of a [[cruciform halo]] also achieves.  Earlier images were much more varied.

Images of Jesus tend to show ethnic characteristics similar to those of the culture in which the image has been created. Beliefs that certain images are historically authentic, or have acquired an authoritative status from Church tradition, remain powerful among some of the faithful, in Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and Roman Catholicism. The [[Shroud of Turin]] is now the best-known example, though the [[Image of Edessa]] and the [[Veil of Veronica]] were better known in medieval times.{{Citation needed lead|date=April 2012}}

=== Before Constantine ===
No physical description of Jesus is contained in any of the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[Gospel]]s.  In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Jesus is said to have manifested as a "light from heaven" that temporarily blinded the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], but no specific form is given. In the [[Book of Revelation]] there is [[John's vision of the Son of Man|a vision the author had]] of "someone like a [[Son of Man]]" in spirit form: "dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. The hair on his head were white like wool, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like  burnt bronze glowing in a furnace (...) His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance" (Revelation 1:12–16, [[New International Version|NIV]]). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form's resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.

[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|right|Jesus in the Catacombs of Rome. Third-century fresco from the [[Catacomb of Callixtus]] of Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].]]

Exodus 20:4–6 "[[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image]]" is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] and except for minor exceptions made Jewish depictions of first-century individuals a scarcity. But attitudes towards the interpretation of this Commandment changed through the centuries, in that while first-century rabbis in [[Judea]] objected violently to the depiction of human figures and placement of statues in Temples, third-century Babylonian Jews had different views; and while no figural art from first-century [[Roman Judea]] exists, the art on the [[Dura synagogue]] walls developed with no objection from the Rabbis early in the third century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold W. Attridge]], Gohei Hata, et al. ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism''. Wayne, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1992. pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire]], Christian art was necessarily furtive and ambiguous, and there was hostility to [[Cult image|idols]] in a group still with a large component of members with Jewish origins, surrounded by, and polemicising against, sophisticated pagan images of gods.  [[Irenaeus]] (d. c. 202), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (d. 215), [[Lactantius]] (c. 240 – c. 320) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (d. c. 339) disapproved of portrayals in images of Jesus. The 36th canon of the non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] in 306 AD reads, "It has been decreed that no pictures be had in the churches, and that which is worshipped or adored be not painted on the walls",&lt;ref name=Elvira2&gt;English translation found at Catholic University of America, accessed 5 September 2012 [https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been interpreted by [[John Calvin]] and other [[Protestants]] as an interdiction of the making of images of Christ.&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;John Calvin ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' Book 1, Chapter V. Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue remained the subject of controversy until the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, pp. 3–6, and Cartlidge and Elliott, 61 (Eusebius quotation) and ''passim''. Clement approved the use of symbolic pictograms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of tombs belonging, most likely, to wealthy&lt;ref&gt;''The Second Church: Popular Christianity A.D. 200–400'' by Ramsay MacMullen, The Society of Biblical Literature, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Christians in the [[catacombs of Rome]], although from literary evidence there may well have been panel [[icon]]s which, like almost all [[classical painting]], have disappeared.

[[File:Dura-europos-paralytic.jpg|left|thumb|230px|The Healing of the Paralytic – one of the oldest possible depictions of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKay |first=John|last2=Hill|first2=Bennett |title=A History of World Societies, Combined Volume |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BM0BrBDztzgC&amp;pg=PA166 |edition=9|accessdate=5 August 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Macmillan |location=United States of America |isbn=978-0-312-66691-0 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Syrian city of [[Dura Europos]], dating from about 235]]

Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by [[pictogram]] symbols such as the [[ichthys]] (fish), the [[peacock]], or an anchor (the [[Labarum]] or Chi-Rho was a later development). The [[staurogram]] seems to have been a very early representation of the crucified Jesus within the sacred texts. Later personified symbols were used, including [[Jonah]], whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between Christ's death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion's den; or [[Orpheus]] charming the animals.&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus as a symbol for [[David]] was already found in hellenized Jewish art. Hall, 66&lt;/ref&gt; The image of "[[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|The Good Shepherd]]", a [[beard]]less youth in [[pastoral]] scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 21-3&lt;/ref&gt; It continues the classical [[Kriophoros]] ("ram-bearer" figure), and in some cases may also represent [[the Shepherd of Hermas]], a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge and Elliott, 53–55. See also ''The Two Faces of Jesus'' by Robin M. Jensen, ''Bible Review'', 17.8, October 2002, and ''Understanding Early Christian Art'' by Robin M. Jensen, Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest depictions clearly intended to directly represent Jesus himself are many showing him as a baby, usually held by his mother, especially in the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'', seen as the first [[theophany]], or display of the [[Incarnation|incarnate]] Christ to the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known portrait of Jesus, found in [[Syria Palaestina|Syria]] and dated to about 235, shows him as a beardless young man of authoritative and dignified bearing. He is depicted dressed in the style of a young philosopher, with close-cropped hair and wearing a tunic and [[pallium]] – signs of good breeding in Greco-Roman society. From this, it is evident that some early Christians paid no heed to the historical context of Jesus being a Jew and visualised him solely in terms of their own social context, as a quasi-heroic figure, without supernatural attributes such as a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] (a fourth-century innovation).&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, S.G.F, "Christ in verbal and depicted imagery". Neusner, Jacob (ed.): ''Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: Studies for Morton Smith at sixty. Part Two: Early Christianity'', pp. 166–167. BRILL, 1975. {{ISBN|978-90-04-04215-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of Jesus had some theological implications. While some Christians thought Jesus should have the beautiful appearance of a young classical hero,&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 299&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gnostic]]s tended to think he could change his appearance at will, for which they cited the [[Meeting at Emmaus]] as evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Every, George; ''Christian Mythology'', p. 65, Hamlyn 1988 (1970 1st edn.) {{ISBN|0-600-34290-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; others including the [[Church Father]]s [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] (d. 165) and [[Tertullian]] (d. 220) believed, following [[Isaiah]]:[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1053.htm 53:2], that Christ's appearance was unremarkable:&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 92&lt;/ref&gt; "he had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him." But when the pagan [[Celsus]] ridiculed the Christian religion for having an ugly God in about 180, [[Origen]] (d. 248) cited [[Psalm]] 45:3: "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, mighty one, with thy beauty and fairness"&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge and Elliott, 53 – this is Psalm 44 in the Latin [[Vulgate]]; English bible translations prefer "glory" and "majesty"&lt;/ref&gt; Later the emphasis of leading Christian thinkers changed; [[Jerome]] (d. 420) and [[Augustine of Hippo]] (d. 430) argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was "beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven."

=== After Constantine ===

Such works "first present us with the fully formed image of [[Christ in Majesty]] that will so dominate Byzantine art"&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 302.&lt;/ref&gt; For detail of Christ, see [[:File:ChristPeterPaul detail.jpg|This File]].]]
[[File:Apsis mosaic, Santa Pudenziana, Rome W3.JPG|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] in a [[Roman mosaic]] in the church of [[Santa Pudenziana]], Rome, c. 400–410 AD during the [[Western Roman Empire]]]]

From the 3rd century onwards, the first narrative scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' to be clearly seen are the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', painted in a catacomb in about 200,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I 132. The image comes from the crypt of [[Lucina (saint)|Lucina]] in the [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of San Callisto|Catacombs_of_San_Callisto]]. There are a number of other 3rd-century images.&lt;/ref&gt; and the miracle of the ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Painted over 40 times in the catacombs of Rome, from the early 3rd century on, and also on sarcophagii. As with the ''Baptism'', some early examples are from [[Gaul]].  Schiller, I, 181&lt;/ref&gt; both of which can be clearly identified by the inclusion of the dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] in ''Baptisms'', and the vertical, shroud-wrapped body of Lazarus.  Other scenes remain ambiguous – an ''[[agape feast]]'' may be intended as a ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'', but before the development of a recognised physical appearance for Christ, and attributes such as the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], it is impossible to tell, as ''tituli'' or captions are rarely used.  There are some surviving scenes from Christ's ''Works'' of about 235 from the [[Dura Europos church]] on the Persian frontier of the Empire.  During the 4th century a much greater number of scenes came to be depicted,&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 94-5&lt;/ref&gt; usually showing Christ as youthful, beardless and with short hair that does not reach his shoulders, although there is considerable variation.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 92-3, [https://archive.is/20120708110958/http://campus.belmont.edu/honors/CatPix/CatPix.html Catacomb images]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is sometimes shown performing miracles by means of a wand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12294b.htm | title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Portraits of the Apostles | accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]] in Rome (430–32).  He uses the [[wand]] to [[Marriage at Cana|change water to wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|multiply the bread and fishes]], and raise [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge and Elliott, 60&lt;/ref&gt; When pictured healing, he only [[laying on of hands|lays on hands]]. The wand is thought to be a symbol of power. The bare-faced youth with the wand may indicate that Jesus was thought of as a user of magic or wonder worker by some of the early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;'' The Two Faces of Jesus'' by Robin M. Jensen, ''Bible Review, 17.8, Oct 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia: Portraits of the Apostles''&lt;/ref&gt; No art has been found picturing Jesus with a wand before the 2nd century. Some scholars suggest that the [[Gospel of Mark]], the [[Secret Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of John]] (the so-called [[Signs Gospel]]), portray such a wonder worker, user of magic, a magician or a Divine man.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus, the Magician'' by Morton Smith, Harper &amp; Row, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Apostle Peter is also depicted in ancient art with a wand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Another depiction, seen from the late 3rd century or early 4th century onwards, showed Jesus with a beard, and within a few decades can be very close to the conventional type that later emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 302&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction has been said to draw variously on Imperial imagery, the type of the classical philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 300–303, who is rather dismissive of other origins for the type&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[Zeus]], leader of the Greek gods, or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], his Roman equivalent,&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 93&lt;/ref&gt; and the protector of Rome. According to art historian Paul Zanker, the bearded type has long hair from the start, and a relatively long beard (contrasting with the short "classical" beard and hair always given to St Peter, and most other apostles);&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge and Elliott, 56–57. St Paul often has a long beard, but short hair, as in the catacomb fresco illustrated. St [[John the Baptist]] also often has long hair and a beard, and often retains in later art the thick shaggy or wavy long hair seen on some of the earliest depictions of Jesus, and in images of philosophers of the Charismatic type.&lt;/ref&gt; this depiction is specifically associated with "Charismatic" philosophers like [[Euphrates the Stoic]], [[Dio of Prusa]] and [[Apollonius of Tyana]], some of whom were claimed to perform miracles.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 257–266 on the charismatics; 299–306 on the type used for Christ&lt;/ref&gt;

After the very earliest examples of c. 300, this depiction is mostly used for hieratic images of Jesus, and scenes from his life are more likely to use a beardless, youthful type.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 299, note 48, and 300.  [http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft3f59n8b0&amp;chunk.id=nsd0e5616&amp;toc.id=endnotes&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=eschol;query=Monza&amp;anchor.id=d0e6396#X]. See also Cartlidge and Elliott, 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tendency of older scholars such as Talbot Rice to see the beardless Jesus as associated with a "classical" artistic style and the bearded one as representing an "Eastern" one drawing from ancient Syria, [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]] seems impossible to sustain, and does not feature in more recent analyses.  Equally attempts to relate on a consistent basis the explanation for the type chosen in a particular work to the differing theological views of the time have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 119&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 3rd century on, some Christian leaders, such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] had recommended the wearing of beards by Christian men.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 290&lt;/ref&gt; The centre parting was also seen from early on, and was also associated with long-haired philosophers.
[[File:Christ treading the beasts - Chapel of Saint Andrew - Ravenna 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Christ as Emperor, wearing military dress, and crushing the serpent representing [[Satan]]. "I am the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6) reads the inscription.  [[Ravenna]], after 500]]

From the middle of the 4th century, after Christianity was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, and gained Imperial favour, there was a new range of images of [[Christ the King]],&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 92-7, though images of Christ the King are found in the previous century also – Hellemo, 6&lt;/ref&gt; using either of the two physical types described above, but adopting the costume and often the poses of Imperial [[iconography]].  These developed into the various forms of  [[Christ in Majesty]].  Some scholars reject the connection between the political events and developments in iconography, seeing the change as a purely theological one, resulting from the shift of the concept and title of [[Pantocrator]] ("Ruler of all") from [[God the Father]] (still not portrayed in art) to Christ, which was a development of the same period, perhaps led by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (d. 373).&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 7–14, citing K. Berger in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another depiction drew from classical images of philosophers, often shown as a youthful "intellectual [[wunderkind]]" in Roman sarcophagii; the ''[[Traditio Legis]]'' image initially uses this type.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, 299.  Zanker has a full account of the development of the image of Christ at pp 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually Jesus became shown as older, and during the 5th century the image with a beard and long hair, now with a cruciform [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], came to dominate, especially in the [[Eastern Empire]].  In the earliest large [[New Testament]] [[mosaic]] cycle, in [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], [[Ravenna]] (ca. 520), Jesus is beardless though the period of his ministry until the scenes of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], after which he is shown with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;The two parts of the cycle are on opposite walls of the nave; Talbot Rice, 157.  [http://www.bridgemanart.com/search.aspx?key=Ravenna%20Apollinare%20nuovo&amp;filter=CBPOIHV#2|CBPOIHV|15|x150 Bridgeman Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Good Shepherd, now clearly identified as Christ, with halo and often rich robes, is still depicted, as on the [[apse]] [[mosaic]] in the church of [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] in Rome, where the [[twelve apostles]] are depicted as twelve sheep below the imperial Jesus, or in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] at Ravenna.
[[File:AberdeenBestiaryFolio004vChristInMajesty (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Christ in majesty]], still with no beard, from an English 12th-century [[illuminated manuscript]].]]

Once the bearded, long-haired Jesus became the conventional representation of Jesus, his facial features slowly began to be standardised, although this process took until at least the 6th century in the [[Eastern Church]], and much longer in the West, where clean-shaven Jesuses are common until the 12th century, despite the influence of [[Byzantine art]].  But by the late Middle Ages the beard became almost universal and when [[Michelangelo]] showed a clean-shaven Apollo-like Christ in his [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''Last Judgment'']] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1534–41) he came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] climate of Rome for this, as well as other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/high-ren-florence-rome/michelangelo/a/michelangelo-last-judgment "Last Judgment"], Esperanca Camara, Khan Academy; [[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450–1600'', 112-114, 118-1191940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0198810504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French scholar Paul Vignon has listed fifteen similarities ("marks", like [[tilaka]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQcBJx0ryjcC&amp;q=marks#v=snippet&amp;q=marks&amp;f=false ''The Shroud of Christ'' ("marks")] by Paul Vignon, Paul Tice, (2002 – {{ISBN|1-885395-96-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; between most of the icons of Jesus after this point, particularly in the icons of "Christ Pantocrator" ("The all-powerful Messiah"). He claims that these are due to the availability of the [[Image of Edessa]] (which he claims to be identical to the [[Shroud of Turin]], via Constantinople)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQcBJx0ryjcC&amp;q=Constantinople#v=snippet&amp;q=Constantinople&amp;f=false ''The Shroud of Christ'' ("Constantinople")] by Paul Vignon, Paul Tice, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; to the artists.  Certainly images believed to have miraculous origins, or the [[Hodegetria]], believed to be a portrait of Mary from the life by [[Saint Luke]], were widely regarded as authoritative by the [[Early Medieval]] period and greatly influenced depictions.  In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the form of images was, and largely is, regarded as revealed truth, with a status almost equal to scripture, and the aim of artists is to copy earlier images without originality, although the style and content of images does in fact change slightly over time.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the historical appearance of Jesus, in one possible translation of the apostle Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], Paul urges Christian men of first-century [[Corinth#Roman era|Corinth]] not to have long hair.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-28592b alternate NIV translation of 1 Corinthians 11:7], and in agreement with modern interpretations of the New Testament, Walvoord and Zuck note, "The alternate translation in the NIV margin, which interprets the man's covering as long hair, is largely based on the view that verse 15 equated the covering with long hair. It is unlikely, however, that this was the point of verse 4." John F. Walvoord and Roy B. Zuck, eds., ''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament'', "1 Corinthians 11:4", (Wheaton: Victor Books, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; An early commentary by [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]] (ca. AD 354 – ca. AD 420/440) says, "Paul was complaining because men were fussing about their hair and women were flaunting their locks in church. Not only was this dishonoring to them, but it was also an incitement to fornication."&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Classical Christian Studies (ICCS) and Thomas Oden, eds., ''The Ancient Christian Commentary Series'', "1 Corinthians 1:4", (Westmont: Inter-Varsity Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-8308-2492-8}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=OiHKpKh0cVMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=0830824928&amp;pg=PA104  Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=March 2013}} have speculated that Paul was a [[Nazirite#Nazirites in the New Testament|Nazirite]] who kept his hair long{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} even though such speculation is at odds with Paul's statement in I Corinthians 11:14 that long hair for men was shameful at the time.

== Later periods ==
[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Christ Carrying the Cross]]'', 1580, by [[El Greco]], whose art reflects both his roots in Greek Orthodox traditions and the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]]]
By the 5th century depictions of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] began to appear, perhaps reflecting a change in the theological focus of the early Church.&lt;ref name=Benedetto51&gt;''The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History'' by Robert Benedetto 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} pages 51-53&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th-century [[Rabbula Gospels]] includes some of the earliest surviving images of the crucifixion and resurrection.&lt;ref name= Benedetto51 /&gt; By the 6th century the bearded depiction of Jesus had become standard in the [[Eastern Church|East]], though the [[Western Church|West]], especially in northern Europe, continued to mix bearded and unbearded depictions for several centuries. The depiction with a longish face, long straight brown hair parted in the middle, and almond shaped eyes shows consistency from the 6th century to the present. Various legends developed which were believed to authenticate the historical accuracy of the standard depiction, such as the [[image of Edessa]] and later the [[Veil of Veronica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Robin M. |last=Jensen |title=Jesus in Christian art|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Companion to Jesus|editor-first=Delbert|editor-last= Burkett|year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-4443-5175-0 |pages= 477–502 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly to aid recognition of the scenes, narrative depictions of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] focused increasingly on the events celebrated in the major feasts of the [[church calendar]], and the events of the Passion, neglecting the miracles and other events of Jesus' public ministry, except for the [[raising of Lazarus]], where the mummy-like wrapped body was shown standing upright, giving an unmistakable visual signature.&lt;ref name="Schiller181"&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'' by G. Schiller 1971 Lund Humphries, London. figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} pages 181–184&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cruciform halo]] was worn only by Jesus (and the other persons of the Trinity), while plain halos distinguished Mary, the Apostles and other saints, helping the viewer to read increasingly populated scenes.&lt;ref name="Schiller181" /&gt;

The period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the 9th century art was permitted again. The [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] was a major theme in the East and every [[Eastern Orthodox]] monk who had trained in [[icon]] painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon of the Transfiguration.&lt;ref name=Bigham226&gt;''The image of God the Father in Orthodox theology and iconography'' by Steven Bigham 1995 {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} pages 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Western depictions increasingly aimed at [[realism (visual art)|realism]], in Eastern icons a low regard for perspective and alterations in the size and proportion of an image aim to reach beyond earthly reality to a spitual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archimandrite]] Vasileios of [[Stavronikita]], "Icons as Liturgical Analogies" in ''Hymn of entry: liturgy and life in the Orthodox church'' 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-88141-026-6}} pages 81-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th century witnessed a turning point in the portrayal of the powerful [[Kyrios]] image of Jesus as a [[Miracles of Jesus|wonder worker]] in the [[Western Church|West]], as the [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscans]] began to emphasize the humility of Jesus both at his birth and his death via the nativity scene as well as the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Brooke&gt;''The image of St Francis'' by Rosalind B. Brooke 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-78291-0}} pages 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raab&gt;''The tradition of Catholic prayer'' by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan, St. Meinrad Archabbey 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-3184-3}} pages 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GFinger&gt;''The vitality of the Christian tradition'' by George Finger Thomas 1944 {{ISBN|0-8369-2378-2}} page 110-112&lt;/ref&gt; The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions and as the joys of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] of were added to the agony of crucifixion a whole new range of emotions were ushered in, with wide-ranging cultural impact on the image of Jesus for centuries thereafter.&lt;ref name=Brooke /&gt;&lt;ref name=GFinger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La vida sacra: contemporary Hispanic sacramental theology'' by James L. Empereur, Eduardo Fernández 2006 {{ISBN|0-7425-5157-1}} pages 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philippines'' by Lily Rose R. Tope, Detch P. Nonan-Mercado 2005 {{ISBN|0-7614-1475-4}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Giotto]], [[Fra Angelico]] and others systematically developed uncluttered images that focused on the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', arguably the first [[High Renaissance]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;''Experiencing Art Around Us'' by Thomas Buser 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-534-64114-6}} pages 382-383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a Cosmic Drama and an Act of Redemption'' by Michael Ladwein 2006 pages 27 and 60&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, at least in some of their poses. However [[Michelangelo]] was considered to have gone much too far in his beardless Christ in his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]], which very clearly adapted classical sculptures of [[Apollo]], and this path was rarely followed by other artists.

The High Renaissance was contemporary with the start of the [[Protestant Reformation]] which, [[The Reformation and art|especially in its first decades]], violently objected to almost all public religious images as idolatrous, and vast numbers were destroyed.  Gradually images of Jesus became acceptable to most Protestants in various contexts, especially in narrative contexts, as book illustrations and prints, and later in larger paintings.  Protestant art continued the now-standard depiction of the physical appearance of Jesus.  Meanwhile, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] re-affirmed the importance of art in assisting the devotions of the faithful, and encouraged the production of new images of or including Jesus in enormous numbers, also continuing to use the standard depiction.

By the end of the 19th century, new reports of miraculous images of Jesus had appeared and continue to receive significant attention, e.g. [[Secondo Pia]]'s 1898 photograph of the [[Shroud of Turin]], one of the most controversial artifacts in history, which during its May 2010 exposition it was visited by over 2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Barnes, 2003 ''Holy Shroud of Turin'' Kessinger Press {{ISBN|0-7661-3425-3}} pages 2-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WMeacham&gt;William Meacham, ''The Authentication of the Turin Shroud:An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology'', [[Current Anthropology]], Volume 24, No 3, June 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-29146 |title=Zenit, May 5, 2010 |publisher=Zenit.org |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927020556/http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-29146 |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 20th-century depiction of Jesus, namely the [[Divine Mercy image]] based on [[Faustina Kowalska]]'s reported vision has over 100 million followers.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine M.

The caption reads, in [[Greek language|Greek]], "Alexamenos worships [his] God", while the image shows a man raising his hand toward a crucified figure with a donkey's head. This seems to refer to a Roman misconception that the Jews worshipped a god with the form of a donkey, so that the image would be at once [[antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]]. A small minority of scholars dispute whether this image depicts Jesus, proposing that this image may be a reference to another deity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

== Conventional depictions ==
Conventional depictions of Christ developed in medieval art include the narrative scenes of the Life of Christ, and many other conventional depictions:

Common narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'' in art]] include:
* [[Nativity of Jesus in art]]
* [[Adoration of the Shepherds]]
* [[Adoration of the Magi]]
* [[Finding in the Temple]]
* [[Baptism of Jesus]]
* [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]
* [[Descent from the Cross]]
* [[Doom (painting)|Last Judgement]]
Devotional images include:
* [[Madonna and child]]
* [[Christ in Majesty]]
* [[Christ Pantokrator]]
* [[Sacred Heart]]
* [[Pietà]] (mother and dead son)
* [[Lamb of God]]
* [[Man of sorrows]]
* [[Pensive Christ]]

== Range of depictions ==
{{See also|God the Father in Western art}}
[[File:Iyesus (Ethiopia).jpg|thumb|left|An 18th-century [[Ethiopian art|Ethiopian image]] of Jesus]]
Certain local traditions have maintained different depictions, sometimes reflecting local racial characteristics, as do the Catholic and Orthodox depictions. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] of [[Egypt]] separated in the 5th century, and has a distinctive depiction of Jesus, consistent with [[Coptic art]].  The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]], also Coptic, developed on Coptic traditions, but shows Jesus and all Biblical figures with the [[Ethiopian]] appearance of its members.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Other traditions in Asia and elsewhere also show the [[race of Jesus]] as that of the local population (see Chinese picture in the gallery below).  In modern times such variation has become more common, but images following the traditional depiction in both physical appearance and clothing are still dominant, perhaps surprisingly so. In Europe, local ethnic tendencies in depictions  of Jesus can be seen, for example in Spanish, German, or [[Early Netherlandish painting]], but almost always surrounding figures are still more strongly characterised.  For example, the [[Virgin Mary]], after the vision reported by [[Bridget of Sweden]], was often shown with blonde hair, but Christ's is very rarely paler than a light brown.

Some medieval Western depictions, usually of the [[Meeting at Emmaus]], where his disciples do not recognise him at first (Luke.24.13–32), showed Jesus wearing a [[Jewish hat]].&lt;ref&gt;A 12th-century English example [http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=311098&amp;handle=book&amp;pg=3 is in the Getty Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607133945/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=311098&amp;handle=book&amp;pg=3 |date=7 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implied argument is that if Jesus's physical appearance had differed markedly from his disciples, then he would have been relatively easy to identify.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt;

== Miraculous images of Jesus ==
{{Main|Acheiropoieta|Divine Mercy image|Head of Christ}}
[[File:Turin plasch.jpg|thumb|[[Secondo Pia]]'s negative of his photo of the [[Shroud of Turin]]. Many Christians believe this image to be the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].]]
There are, however, some images which have been claimed to realistically show how Jesus looked. One early tradition, recorded by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], says that Jesus once washed his face with water and then dried it with a cloth, leaving an image of his face imprinted on the cloth. This was sent by him to King [[Abgarus of Edessa]], who had sent a messenger asking Jesus to come and heal him of his disease.  This image, called the ''Mandylion'' or [[Image of Edessa]], appears in history in around 525. Numerous replicas of this "[[Acheiropoieta|image not made by human hands]]" remain in circulation. There are also [[icon]] compositions of Jesus and Mary that are traditionally believed by many [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] to have originated in paintings by [[Luke the Evangelist]].

A currently familiar depiction is that on the [[Shroud of Turin]], whose records go back to 1353. Controversy surrounds the shroud and its exact origin remains subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;William Meacham, ''The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology'', Current Anthropology, Volume 24, No 3, June 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shroud of Turin:  Its Ecumenical Implications|last=The Rev. Albert R. Dreisbach|year=1997|accessdate=15 June 2014|quote= Returning to the ecumenical dimension of this sacred linen, it  became very evident to me on the night of August 16, 1983, when local judicatory leaders offered their corporate blessing to the TURIN SHROUD EXHIBIT  and participated in the Evening Office of the Holy Shroud.  The Greek Archbishop, the Roman Catholic Archbishop, the Episcopal Bishop and the Presiding Bishop of the AME Church gathered before the world's first full size, backlit transparency of the Shroud and joined clergy representing the Assemblies of God, Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians in an amazing witness to ecumenical unity.  At the conclusion of the service, His Grace Bishop John of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Atlanta, turned to me and said: "Thank you very much for picking our day."  I didn't fully understand the significance of his remark until he explained to me that August 16th is the Feast of the Holy Mandylion commemorating the occasion in 944 A.D. when the Shroud was first shown to the public in Byzantium following its arrival the previous day from Edessa in southeastern Turkey. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[Catholic devotion]]s approved by the Holy See, that to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]], now uses the image of the face on the shroud as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer [[Secondo Pia]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz, 1984, ''Relics'' OSV Press {{ISBN|0-87973-701-8}} page 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball635&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pages 635 and 239&lt;/ref&gt; The image cannot be clearly seen on the shroud itself with the naked eye, and it surprised Pia to the extent that he said he almost dropped and broke the photographic plate when he first saw the developed negative image on it in the evening of 28 May 1898.&lt;ref name=Ball635 /&gt;

Before 1898, devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] used an image based on the [[Veil of Veronica]], where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the [[Via Dolorosa]] on the way to [[Calvary]]. When she paused to wipe the sweat from Jesus's face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as [[Catholic devotions]] traces back to Sister [[Marie of St Peter]] and the [[Venerable]] [[Leo Dupont]] who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in [[Tours]] France, and Sister [[Maria Pierina]] De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in [[Milan]] Italy.

[[Warner Sallman]] stated that ''[[The Head of Christ]]'' was the result of a "miraculous vision that he received late one night", proclaiming that "the answer came at 2 A.M., January 1924" as "a vision in response to my prayer to God in a despairing situation."&lt;ref name="Morgan1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=David|title=Icons of American Protestantism: The Art of Warner Sallman|year=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06342-4|page=62|quote=Sallman always insisted that his initial sketch of Jesus was the result of spiritual "picturization," a miraculous vision that he received late one night. "The answer came at 2 A.M., January 1924," he wrote. "It came as a vision in response to my prayer to God in a despairing situation." The situation was a deadline: Sallman had been commissioned to paint the February cover for the ''Covenant Companion'', the monthly magazine of the Evangelical Covenant Church, and he had artist's block for weeks. The February issue was focusing on Christian youth, and Sallman's assignment was to provide an inspirational image of Christ that would "challenge our young people." "I mused over it for a long time in prayer and meditation," Sallman recalled, "seeking for something which would catch the eye and convey the message of the Christian gospel on the cover."}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Head of Christ'' is venerated in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Fall 1997|journal=Coptic Church Review|volume=18|issue=3|title=Theological Issues of the Coptic Orthodox Inculturation in Western Society|author=Otto F.A.

In going through his billfold, they discover a small reproduction of Sallman's Christ, quickly apologize, then vanish "into the jungle without inflicting further harm."

'''Eric Newton''' (1893–1965) was an English artist, writer, broadcaster and art critic. He produced several books in addition to his newspaper and radio work and created mosaics for Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, mostly on a religious theme. His radio broadcasts made him well known to the British public in the 1930s.

==Career==
After gaining a BA from [[Manchester University]] in 1913, he worked as a designer at Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, the [[mosaic]] firm founded by his grandfather and based in Old Trafford, Manchester. His work, and that of the Oppenheimer firm is still to be seen in several churches in Britain and Ireland. He took part in the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Paris exhibition]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=obittimes&gt;{{Cite news |title=Obituary. Mr. Eric Newton |newspaper=The Times |date=11 March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known as an art critic and writer. He was appointed art critic of the [[Manchester Guardian]] in 1930, although he had provided copy for that paper for some years prior to this. He was art critic for [[The Times]] for three years from 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/newtone.htm | title=Dictionary of Art Historians. E. Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote frequently for the [[New York Times]], [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Eric Newton, 71, London Art Critic. Newsman, author, Teacher and Lecturer Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=11 March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ArtReview]]&lt;ref name="art review twitter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/ArtReview_/status/895275374342537217 |title=''ArtReview 'Thoughts about promise'' Eric Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton delivered radio lectures on art, notably the 1935 [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] 12 part series "The Artist and his Public" subsequently turned into the first of several books.&lt;ref name=Rfield&gt;{{cite web |title=''L. Oppenheimer Ltd and the Mosaics of Eric Newton.''|url=http://www.tilesoc.org.uk/events/conference2006/papers/pdf/field.pdf  Robert Field}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1935 |title= The artist and His Public |url= |location= |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the radio arts series ''The Critics''. In this programme, his Times Obituary states "his lucidity and critical sense were trenchantly displayed".&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt; The Oxford Dictionary of Art describes him as "a clear and polished writer and also an articulate lecturer and radio broadcaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1952 |title= Oxford Dictionary of Art |url= |location= |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-172762-7 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These broadcasts made his name well known and local newspaper archives reveal that Newton was clearly in demand, delivering public lectures across the country in the late 1930s and 1940s.

Newton undertook lecture tours to North America in 1937, 1953 and 1956, the 1937 tour of Canada was sponsored by the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. His diary of this tour was subsequently published (see below). The 1956 tour included the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] where he lectured on modern art. A photograph exists in the university archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric Newton visits the University to lecture on Modern Art :: S.J. Carew Photograph Collection|url=http://collections.mun.ca/u?/sjcarew,843 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was lecturer in art history at the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Art and crafts]] from 1963.&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt;

His MA, completed in 1951 at Manchester was on the subject of the renaissance artist [[Tintoretto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=M.A. |first=Eric |last=Newton |title=Tintoretto and the Scuolo and Church of San Rocco, Venice.|publisher=Manchester University |year=1951 |docket=Th8458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently published in 1952 as a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1952 |title= Tintoretto |url= |location= |publisher=Longmans, Green |isbn=978-0-8371-4501-3 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton was [[Slade Professor of Fine Art#Slade Professors, Oxford University|Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213123228/http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 April 1958 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; and art adviser to the [[Commonwealth Institute]] from 1960 to 1963. He was president of the British Section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] between 1949 and 1961.&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt;

While he left the family firm, he continued to create mosaics for much of his life, those in the side chapels of [[Sacred Heart Church, Hillsborough|Sacred Heart Church]] Sheffield being installed in 1961. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] holds many designs of Newton Mosaics and theatre set designs in its Stella Newton Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Courtauld Institute of Art Newsletter Feb 2010 |url=http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/booklibrary/collections_services/documents/2010-02Newsletter.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921200623/http://courtauld.ac.uk/booklibrary/collections_services/documents/2010-02Newsletter.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Newton was born in 1893 to Lehmann James Oppenheimer and Edith née Newton. His mother was from [[Heaton Mersey]].&lt;ref&gt;1911 census&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to [[Hulme Grammar School]] from [[William Hulme#Hulme.27s Charity|Hulme's Charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hulme's Charity |newspaper=Manchester Courier |date=1 October 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from Manchester University, he served in the army during the [[First World War]], joining the [[Manchester Regiment]] as a 2nd Lieutenant from the Manchester University Contingent of the [[Officer Training Corps]] on 14 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28973 |date=13 November 1914 |page=9276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary captain in September 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29312 |date=1 October 1915 |page=9664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His medal card suggests he served in France and was awarded the [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] and [[British War Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] Catalogue Reference:WO/372/14&lt;/ref&gt;

His father (also a mosaic manufacturer in the family firm) served as a lieutenant in the London Regiment ([[Artists Rifles|Artists' Rifles]]) and died in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/regimentalrollof00highiala#page/10/mode/2up|title=The regimental roll of honour and war record of the Artists' Rifles (1/28th, 2/28th and 3/28th battalions, the London Regiment T.

Lehmann is buried in the [[Boulogne]] Eastern Cemetery (Grave ref VII. B. 11.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/48333/OPPENHEIMER,%20LEHMANN%20JAMES|title=CWGC - Casualty Details|author=Reading Room Manchester|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[London Gazette]] records the recruitment of "Eric Newton Oppenheimer", and promotion of "Eric N. Oppenheimer", it was after the war that he formally changed his name from Oppenheimer to his mother's maiden name of Newton, the latter sounding less German. He married his first wife, Isabel Aileen Vinicombe on 29 November 1915 at the Church of St James, Birch in [[Rusholme]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lan-opc.org.uk/Manchester/Rusholme/stjames/marriages_1896-1921.html|title=Lancashire OnLine Parish Clerk Project |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple divorced in 1934 after which Newton married the fashion designer [[Stella Mary Newton|Stella Mary Pearce]]. The couple moved to London, living at 3 Cumberland Gardens. Newton died in his London office in 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17278">'''Exploito''' is a term generally given to describe cover version or sound-alike recordings that capitalize on the official recordings of artists. Typically they are of the [[Budget album|budget release]] type of album. Often the buying public would think they are buying an album by the actual artist.

==Background==
The typical exploito album is aimed at the unsuspecting buyer with the attraction of a budget price. In the United States Alshire was one label that released this type of album. In [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, the label there was [[Arc Records (Canada)|Arc]]. The current hits of the day would be recorded. Sometimes local musicians would be used. Also some extra original compositions would be added by hired writers or people that worked for the label.&lt;ref&gt;Canehdian.com [http://www.canehdian.com/artist-directory/canadian-music-artists/blues-train-biography/ Blues Train Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
One example of how an exploito album imitates a genuine  release is the ''[[Mark, Don &amp; Terry 1966–67|Mark, Don &amp; Terry]]'' album which has the layout and cover art and design copies a recent release of a legitimate album.&lt;ref&gt;Ithsmus April 22, 2012 [http://isthmus.com/music/vinyl-cave/vinyl-cave-monumental-funk-by-mark-farner-and-don-brewer/ Vinyl Cave: "Monumental Funk" by Mark Farner and Don Brewer by Bob Koch]&lt;/ref&gt; They often ended up being put into stores by [[Rack Jobber]]s. Some of the releases are by unknown or no-name artists and the sound quality and packaging in the early days made for an inferior product.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' May 24, 1969 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA30&amp;lpg=RA1-PA30&amp;dq=%22Rack+Jobbers%22Budget+records&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-9Fsg45dWV&amp;sig=y9vruBc4MUiIyoYK7XJny-3s0is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW7vHGkqvKAhUHl5QKHVSeBQwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rack%20Jobbers%22Budget%20records&amp;f=false C-34 ''Rack Jobbers Force Budget Line Sales'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to almost a subgenre that is referred to as semi-exploito or exploito psychedelic rock.&lt;ref&gt;Ithsmus May 22, 2011 [http://isthmus.com/music/vinyl-cave/vinyl-cave-minnie-riperton-and-yma-sumac-rock-out/ Vinyl Cave: Minnie Riperton and Yma Sumac rock out by Bob Koch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FuzzyWasabi Wednesday, April 29, 2009 [http://fuzzywasabi.blogspot.com/2009/04/fools-on-hill-22-fabulously-fake.html Fools On The Hill 22: Fabulously Fake Freakouts – 25 wannabe psychedelic tunes from all over the world]&lt;/ref&gt; The Animated Egg is one.&lt;ref&gt;Night of the Living Vinyl Thursday, 9 December 2010 [http://nightofthelivingvinyl.blogspot.com/2010/12/exploito-psych-1-id-and-animated-egg.html Exploito-psych #1 The Id and The Animated Egg]&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on budget label [[Alshire Records]] and on [[Somerset Records]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Animated-Egg-The-Animated-Egg/master/596095 The Animated Egg – The Animated Egg]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others that give some info on the musicians are ''Grass, A Rock Musical'' by Sven Libaek,&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Sven-Libaek-Grass-A-Rock-Musical/release/3485333 Sven Libaek – Grass - A Rock Musical]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producers and labels==
;Alshire
In 1969, Alshire Records released an album called ''Famous Songs of Hank Williams: A Return Trip with the Modern Sounds In Modern Rock-Acid Sound'', an album that featured musicians covering [[Hank Williams]] songs, but in the [[acid rock]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Popsike [http://www.popsike.com/MODERN-SOUNDSHank-Williams-LP-ALSHIRE-EXPLOITO-PSYCH-NM-RockAcid-Alshire/150715606882.html MODERN SOUNDS..Hank Williams LP ALSHIRE EXPLOITO PSYCH NM- Rock-Acid Alshire]&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a combination of country-style vocals with fuzz guitar and garage rock backing. All Music reviewer Jason Ankeny described the release as "the most absurdly conceived exploito release in the entire Alshire catalog."&lt;ref&gt;All Music [http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/famous-songs-of-hank-williams-in-modern-rock-acid-sound-mr0001736884 Various Artists ''Famous Songs of Hank Williams in Modern Rock-Acid Sound (LP - Alshire #5136)'' Review by Jason Ankeny]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Crown, Custom
One label that is well known for exploito and budget albums is [[Crown Records]]. Two collectable exploito albums released on the label are The Firebirds ''Light My Fire'' album&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/artist/1535906-The-Firebirds-2 The Firebirds (2) Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; and 31 Flavors ''Hair'' album&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/artist/1535912-31-Flavors 31 Flavors Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; which were both rereleased together on a CD by Gear Fab Records.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Firebirds2-31-Flavors-Light-My-Fire-Hair/release/4990686 The Firebirds (2), 31 Flavors – Light My Fire/ Hair]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown's subsidiary Custom put out an album ''More Psychedelic Guitars'' which featured the tracks "Another Trip", "Really Got It Bad", "Out Of Touch", The Letdown", Psychedelic A-Go-Go", "Flower Power", Can You Dig It", "Sit- In", "Lost In Space" and "Psychedelic Venture". The artist playing on the album was guitarist [[Jerry Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;Both Sides Now Publications [http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/custom.html ''Custom Album Discography By David Edwards and Mike Callahan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Cole-More-Psychedellic-Guitars/release/2629040 Jerry Cole  – More Psychedellic Guitars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown and Custom were owned by the [[Bihari Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' Billboard 16 Dec, 1967 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xScEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Bihari+Brothers%22Crown+Custom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvUMLcrayz&amp;sig=HbwYoyUhLTxrUojyTqBW4u1Dyjs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIqufKkKvKAhUBJZQKHZ1WDAMQ6AEIRzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bihari%20Brothers%22Crown%20Custom&amp;f=false Page 6 Crown/Kent Buzzes As Custom Presser]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Sides Now Publications [http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/crown/crownstory.html The Crown Records Story By Mike Callahan, David Edwards, Patrice Eyries, Randy Watts and Tim Neely]&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Leo Muller (producer)|Leo Muller]] &amp; [[Stereo Gold Award]]
One of the producers that has become well known for exploito records is Leo Muller which in fact was an alias for [[Dave Miller (producer)|Dave Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third series'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MD8hAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=%22Leo+Muller%22Dave+Miller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i9vzSimqHi&amp;sig=qQd-QAekulnmTwhQ4r-s1iwvcmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisr7r59qrKAhWCHJQKHQxLArcQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Leo%20Muller%22Dave%20Miller&amp;f=false Page 254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he hired [[Thin Lizzy]] musicians [[Phil Lynott]], [[Eric Bell]] and [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]] to record an album that would be released as '''''Funky Junction''' Play A Tribute to '''Deep Purple'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Willards Wormholes [http://www.willardswormholes.com/archives/20668 FUNKY JUNCTION Play A Tribute To Deep Purple (1973) – Early THIN LIZZY Mercenary Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Funky Junction would be used again by Muller for the misleadingly titled ''Especially For You…Gladys Knight and The Pips'' with guests Funky Junction, released in 1973. The album didn't feature [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]]. It featured covers of Gladys Knight songs and two numbers credited to Funky Junction, "Talking Trash" and "Roads End".&lt;ref&gt;Spiral-2 [https://nlgbbbblth.wordpress.com/tag/leo-muller/ LP 285: Unknown / Funky Junction – Especially For You…Gladys Knight and The Pips (Stereo Gold Award, 1975)]&lt;/ref&gt; "Talking Trash" also appeared on ''Tamla Hits'' by Dianne And The New Worlds, an album supposedly in the [[Soul Music|Soul]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Dianne-And-The-New-Worlds-Tamla-Hits/master/358548 Dianne And The New Worlds – Tamla Hits]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Roads End" would appear on two [[Jimi Hendrix]] exploitation albums, ''Tribute To Jimi Hendrix'' by Jeff Cooper And The Stoned Wings, and ''Tribute To Jimi Hendrix'' by The Purple Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Jeff-Cooper-And-The-Stoned-Wings-Tribute-To-Jimi-Hendrix/release/840505 Jeff Cooper And The Stoned Wings – Tribute To Jimi Hendrix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Purple-Fox-Tribute-To-Jimi-Hendrix/release/3392689 The Purple Fox  – Tribute To Jimi Hendrix]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Deacon Records|Deacon]]
Deacon was another budget label that was sold via supermarkets and gas stations. A good deal of its catalogue consisted of orchestral and middle of the road type albums.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' October 24, 1970 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=Deacon+records+Syad+Ali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K8vB_sZQqk&amp;sig=63cgc8jueQJLNiANZAeF_KQwSNk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEwIrkzLLKAhWkGKYKHc_cBmEQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Deacon%20records%20Syad%20Ali&amp;f=false Page 62 International Music Reports, Crown, Premier, Budget Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; The label released an album in 1970 called ''The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams''. The credited artist Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners was displayed on the front cover positioned in the song list column in much smaller writing than the subject that was [[Hank Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Tex-Williams-The-Sundowners-The-Golden-Hits-From-The-Legend-That-Was-Hank-Williams/release/7121766 Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners  – The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://cdn.discogs.com/Wjr1RNQaacXefKihzNGTtoLjM3U=/fit-in/600x595/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(96)/discogs-images/R-7121766-1445433306-8223.jpeg.jpg More Images]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 the label issued ''Tribute To Johnny Cash''. Like the ''Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams'' release, the credited artist had one part of the name the same as the subject artist.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Johnny-Dodds-Tribute-To-Johnny-Cash/release/6246619 Johnny Dodds (2)  – Tribute To Johnny Cash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Tex-Williams-The-Sundowners-The-Golden-Hits-From-The-Legend-That-Was-Hank-Williams/release/7121766 Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners  – The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; The label even issued a single-sided 45RPM single aimed at bingo halls with the songs "Let's Play Bingo" and "Bingo Goes Pop".&lt;ref&gt;45 Sleeves [http://45-sleeves.com/UK/deacon/deac-uk.htm DEACON, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Sutton Records|Sutton]]
Sutton was founded in 1963 by [[Bob Blythe]], formerly of [[Tops Records]],&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' Mar 2, 1963 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dwsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Sutton+Records%22Budget&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgJETTcq5F&amp;sig=7sjOj9jtKYXKGIc6s3n2bIe7Yz0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN0dKIqI_KAhVGI6YKHWjRDKAQ6AEINTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sutton%20Records%22Budget&amp;f=false Page 6 Bob Blythe Starts New Name Talent Low-Budget LP Line]&lt;/ref&gt; was a label known for budget exploito albums. One band that had records released under its own name but destined straight for the cut out bins to be filled by the rack jobbers was the New Dimension. Surf music producers [[Tony Hilder]] and [[Bob Hafner]] provided the material.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond The Beat Generation [http://home.unet.nl/kesteloo/newdimensions.html The New Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MusicDish e-Journal 2001-05-14 [http://www.musicdish.com/mag/index.php3?id=3760 From Surf to Folk Rock: He's Done it All!

==Exploiting mainstream artists==
There have been releases made to cash in on the success of [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. In 1973, Arc Records released an album, ''Smash Hits Tom Jones Style'' which included the songs "A Minute Of Your Time", " Delilah", " Green Green Grass Of Home " and "It's Not Unusual".&lt;ref&gt;Discogs - [https://www.discogs.com/Unknown-Artist-Smash-Hits-Tom-Jones-Style/release/7590354 Unknown Artist – Smash Hits Tom Jones Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Arc also issued an album called ''The Golden Ring Sing The Best Hits Of Tom Jones''.

[[Sam Sorono]] recorded an album ''Sam Sorono Sings Tom Jones' Greatest Hits'', produced by [[Chris Babida]] and released on [[EMI]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs - [https://www.discogs.com/Sam-Sorono-Sing-Tom-Jones-Greatest-Hits/release/4986608 Sam Sorono – Sing Tom Jones' Greatest Hits]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference with Sorono was that he was a real singer who eventually moved to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. He was based in [[Bramley, Rotherham]]. A former actor in Martial arts films, he had been an entertainer in the Philippines. He had played with artists such as [[Count Basie]] and [[Ike and Tina Turner]].

In 1966, a record label called Tifton released an album called ''Batman And Robin'' by The Sensational Guitars Of Dan &amp; Dale. The guitars were actually by [[Danny Kalb]] and [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]]. [[Sun Ra]] and [[Al Kooper]] played organ.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/The-Sensational-Guitars-Of-Dan-Dale-Batman-And-Robin/release/395760 The Sensational Guitars Of Dan &amp; Dale – Batman And Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
Some exploito albums have been of better-than-average quality with their musical arrangements. One example is the ''Mariano and the Unbelievables'' album that was released in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed'' Edited by Kim Cooper and David Smay, Illustrations by David Neely [https://books.google.com/books?id=jFKsR0K82hYC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=Exploito+music&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilnKTh66rKAhWEJ6YKHb8YAz8Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Exploito%20music&amp;f=false ''Mariano and the Unbelievaables'' (Capiltol, 1967)]&lt;/ref&gt; An album by a group called ''The Blues Train'' that was released in 1970 on a budget exploito label called Condor is now valued by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Canehdian.com [http://www.canehdian.com/artist-directory/canadian-music-artists/blues-train-biography/ Blues Train Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Over a thousand years of using Chinese classical script is irrelevant? This is an article about culture, and not geography. Vietnam is culturally East Asian. Vietnamese (along with Korean and Japanese) are still used today to determine the pronunciation of middle Chinese.</comment>

In [[Chinese art]], the '''Four Gentlemen''', also called the '''Four Noble Ones''', are four plants: the [[Prunus mume|plum blossom]], the [[orchid]], the [[bamboo]], and the [[chrysanthemum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardens.si.edu/come-learn/docs/Template_Orchids_The%20Four%20Gentlemen.pdf Orchids: The Four Gentlemen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brushmeistersofbrooklyn.net/articles/symbolisminbrushpainti.html Symbolism in Brush Painting]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term compares the four plants to [[Confucianist]] ''[[junzi]]'', or "gentlemen". They are most typically depicted in traditional [[ink and wash painting]] and they belong to the category of [[bird-and-flower painting]] in Chinese art.

The Four Gentlemen have been used in Chinese painting since the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) because of their refined beauty, and were later adopted [[East Asian cultural sphere|elsewhere in East Asia]] by artists in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. As they represent the four different seasons (the plum blossom for winter, the orchid for spring, the bamboo for summer, and the chrysanthemum for autumn), the four are used to depict the unfolding of the seasons through the year.

'''Friederike Caroline Neuber''', née '''Friederike Caroline Weissenborn''', also known as  '''Friedericke Karoline Neuber''', '''Frederika Neuber''', '''Karoline Neuber''', '''Carolina Neuber''', '''Frau Neuber''', and '''''Die Neuberin''''',  (9 March 1697 in [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]] – 30 November 1760 near [[Dresden]]), was a [[Germans|German]] actress and theatre director. She is considered one of the most famous actresses and actor-managers in the history of the German theatre, "influential in the development of modern German theatre." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Caroline-Neuber|title=Caroline Neuber: German actress and manager|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuber also worked to improve the social and artistic status of German actors and actresses, emphasizing [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic technique]].&lt;ref name="Sharpe, Lesley 1995" /&gt; During a time when theatrical managers in Germany were predominantly men, Caroline Neuber stands out in history as a remarkably ambitious woman who, during her 25-year career, was able to alter theatrical history, elevating the status of German theatre alongside of Germany's most important male theatrical leaders at the time, such as "her actor-manager husband Johann, the popular stage fool Johann Müller, the major actor of the next generation Johann Schönemann, the multi-talented newcomer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and principally, their de facto Dramaturg, Johann Gottsched."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:Neuberin playbill.png|thumb|Playbill of the theatrical company of Friederike Caroline Neuber from 8 September 1738 in Hamburg.]]

=== Early life ===
Friederike Caroline Weissenborn was born 9 March 1697 in [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]] to Daniel Weissenborn and his wife Anna Rosine Weissenborn, née Anna Rosine Wihelmine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Peter Kümmel: ''With Anger and Courage.'' In: ''DIE ZEIT,'' No. 48 (English translation from German) ([http://www.zeit.de/2010/48/Theater-Neuberin/komplettansicht online], accessed 11 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a legal court inspector and her mother was very well-educated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From her mother, Caroline learned reading, writing, and French. Her tyrannical father beat her mother until her mother's early death in 1705. Caroline spent the rest of her childhood with her father in [[Zwickau]] where she lived from 1702–1717.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Allegedly, Caroline was unloved and neglected by her father who may have also beaten her; she had a scar on her face attributed to her father's beatings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reportedly, she attempted to escape her home as early as age 15. However, it was not until age 20, in 1717, that Caroline successfully ran away from home with [[:de:Johann Neuber|Johann Neuber]], a clerk who had worked for her father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The couple married one year later in 1718. Together the Neubers "served their theatrical apprenticeship in the traveling companies of Christian Spiegelberg (1717–22) and Karl Caspar Haack (1722–25)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:DBP 1976 908 Friederike Caroline Neuber.jpg|thumb|200px|Friederike Caroline Neuber as [[:de:Medea|Medea,]] [[:de:Briefmarken-Jahrgang 1976 der Deutschen Bundespost|stamp 1976]]|left]]

=== The Neuber Theatrical Troupe ===
In 1727, she and her husband founded their own [[acting troupe]] which became a "training ground for some of the great actor-managers to come”.&lt;ref name="Sharpe, Lesley 1995"&gt;Sharpe, Lesley. "Reform Of the German Theatre: Frau Neuber &amp; Frau Gottsched." Women in European Theatre. Ed. Elizabeth Woodrough. Oxford: Intellect, 1995. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year their company was "granted a patent by the elector of Saxony, [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]], to perform at the [[Leipzig]] Easter Fair." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The troupe is recorded to have played in nineteen towns and cities as spread out as [[Warsaw]], [[Kiel]], and [[Strasburg, Germany|Strasburg]], most often in [[Dresden]], [[Hamburg]], and Leipzig.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The German Nachspiel in the Eighteenth Century|last=John|first=David Gethin|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no complete repertoire for the company exists there is an existing "detailed account of eight months in 1735, 8 April to 5 December" in which the troupe is listed to have performed "seventy-five 'Schauspiele' (a mixture of 'Tragödien' and 'Cömodien') in 203 performances."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, they are recorded to have performed ninety-three Nachspiele (a short play usually following a longer comedy or tragedy) in 107 performances during these eight months.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Neuber troupe has been described by historians as "a training ground for later principles" such as Heinrich Koch and Friedrich Schönemann, "each of whom founded his own troupe afterwards and enjoyed far more success than his mentor."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Partnership with J.C. Gottsched ===
As early as 1725, Neuber's acting technique had "attracted the attention of [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]], the critic and drama reformer who modeled his work on classical French tragedy and comedy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout her career, she was active in the introduction of the [[Theatre of France|French theatre]] in Germany, and worked closely with Gottsched and his wife, [[Luise Gottsched]], to elevate the status of German theatre. Gottsched was the first to call her "Die Neuberin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gottsched was important to the Neubers' company for he initiated in their company a "careful learning of parts and rehearsal for the heavily improvised [[farce]]s and [[harlequinade]]s that then dominated the German stage."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The theatrical partnership between Caroline Neuber and Johann Gottsched lasted until 1739 and is "usually regarded as the turning point in the history of German theatre and the start of modern German acting." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Banishment of Harlekin/Hanswurst ===
In 1736 Caroline Neuber came to Frankfurt with the intention to perform respectable theatre and set up her stage on the Liebfrauenberg.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Neubers pattern in 1736-7 was to play "major dramas of classical base of German imitations" while excluding the traditionally crude topics associated with the popular theatrical character [[Harlekin]] from their performances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This demonstrated that a change in tone for theatre in Frankfurt was beginning, with the Neubers performances that were more respectable than the popular theatre revolving around Harlekin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, it took more than Neuber's resolve to "change the taste and demands of most audiences of the day."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1737, Neuber symbolically banished [[Hanswurst]] from the stage as part of her efforts to elevate the status of German theatre. The staged banishment has generally been regarded as an emblematic moment in German theatre history for the transition from popular, improvised, so-called "Stegreiftheater" to a modern bourgeois literary mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hanswurst and Herr Ich: Subjection and Abjection in Enlightenment Censorship of the Comic Figure |last=Jürs-Munby |first=Karen |page=125 |url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/4232/1/download.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Hanswurt plays were created specifically for the enjoyment of male audiences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Jurs-Munby, Karen. "Performing the Modern Self: German and French Discourses on Acting in the Enlightenment." Order No. 9983582 University of Minnesota, 2000. Ann Arbor: ''ProQuest.'' Web. 13 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period it was becoming more acceptable for women to pursue work as actresses; however, it was still unacceptable for women to work as managers of theatrical companies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Theatre historians of the late eighteenth century often described Caroline Neuber as one who had a masculine spirit and manly ambitions in order to reconcile what they viewed as “the disparity between her professional achievements and her gender role.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Partnership with Lessing ===
Caroline is attributed with discovering playwright [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], often considered by historians to be the first [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]]. After meeting Caroline, his interest in theatre grew. He translated several French plays for her and eventually wrote his first play, ''The Young Scholar'' which Neuber produced for him in 1748.[[File:Grab Friederike Caroline Neuber Dresden-Leuben.jpg|thumb|Friederike Caroline Neuber grave in the [[:de:Leuben|Leubener]] cemetery in Dresden]]

== Legacy ==
===''Caroline Neuber'' (play)===
''Caroline Neuber'', called ''Die Neubrin'' in many of its productions, is a biographical play written by [[Eberhard Keindorff]] and [[Günther Weisenborn|Gunther Weisenborn]] about Caroline Neuber's life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gladberry, Glen W. "Stages of Reform: Caroline Neuber/Die Neuberin in the Third Reich." ''Essays on Twentieth-Century German Drama and Theater: An American Reception 1977-1999''. Ed. Hellmut H. Rennert. New York: P. Lang, 2004. 167-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was created for actress [[Agnes Straub]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Caroline Neuber'' premiered in the 1934/35 season in [[Nazi Germany|The Third Reich]] and was written as "the government consolidated its power and generated arts bureaucracies to oversee the publication, production, and response to plays."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The play was permitted publication in 1934 and premiered in Berlin in 1935. ''Caroline Neuber'' is unusual for its era, in which German theatre was censored by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], for the content of the play "challenges some of the basic cultural prejudices of the Third Reich."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Caroline Neuber.JPG|thumb|Caroline Neuber monument in Dresden-[[:de:Laubegast|Laubegast]]|left]] By this point in history, Caroline Neuber was seen by theatre professionals as an important theatrical reformer of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this Keindorff and Weisenborn crafted a play about her life that served as a means for audiences to compare Neuber's reformation to the Nazi-directed theatrical reformation and thus, critique Nazi-theatre appropriately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When analyzed, ''Caroline Neuber'' is interpreted as "a condemnation of the Third Reich itself." However, for those who had the power to censor theatre, Neuber's biography play was seen simply as a play about a famous actor, manager, and reformer that "complimented National Socialist reforms of the stage."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Nazis were initiating reforms to create what they saw as "new, honest, noble, wonderful German theatre."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this to "the general audience ''Die Neuberin'' was star biography; for the preferred audience, the reform stage of the past collided with the reforming stage of the present."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caroline Neuber's legacy as not only an actress/manager but a reformer of the German stage served as a vehicle for Germans to learn from the past and critique the present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caroline Neuber Prize ===
This award commemorates Neuber's theatrical contributions to Germany. Since 1998, the city of Leipzig awards the Caroline Neuber Prize endowed with €6,000 every two years on her birthday in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/freizeit-kultur-und-tourismus/kunst-und-kultur/kunst-und-kulturpreise/caroline-neuber-preis/|title=Caroline Neuber Prize|first=|date=|website=Stadt Leipzig|publisher=|access-date=4 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded to a female theatre artist from a German-speaking country who sets new standards for excellence in theatre arts. Those who have been honored with the prize include Monika Gintersdorfer, [[Jutta Hoffmann]], [[Inge Keller]], Konstanze Lauterbach, Nele Hertling, Karin Henkel, [[Sasha Waltz]], and Ann-Elisabeth Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/freizeit-kultur-und-tourismus/kunst-und-kultur/kunst-und-kulturpreise/caroline-neuber-preis/bisherige-preistraegerinnen/|title=Caroline Neuber Prize – Bisherige Preisträgerinnen|first=|date=|website=Stadt Leipzig|publisher=|access-date=4 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels''''' is a 1653 painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now held in a private collection, but previously owned by the [[Rothschild]] family, which is how it came into the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] collection for 50 years after [[World War II]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=Restitution&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043519/http://www.konvent.gv.at/pls/portal/docs/page/PG/DE/XX/AB/AB_05184/FNAMEORIG_000000.HTML Erzherzog Leopold Wilhelm in seiner Galerie Brüssel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. The artist himself holds his hat in his hand and is listening to his patron as the archduke gestures with his cane towards some recent acquisitions. The paintings are arranged in rows on the walls of an L-shaped room, with the men standing in front of a doorway with the words "TIMORE DOMINI" below a sculpted portrait of the archduke. Another set of paintings is positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.

This painting is dated 1653 and was painted after earlier, larger versions that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive of these gallery paintings was the [[The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Painting Gallery in Brussels|large version on copper]] in the [[Museo del Prado]] with a different selection of paintings. That was produced as a gift from the archduke to  [[Philip IV of Spain]].

==Paintings depicted==
Many of the recognizable paintings in the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, are still in the Viennese collection. This copy was probably produced in tandem with [[Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels (Galdiano)|a similar version]] in the [[Museo Lázaro Galdiano]] as a gift.

==Provenance==
This painting was one of those forcibly "donated" by Baron Alphonse de Rothschild in 1938 and it was meant for the [[Führermuseum]], looted by the Nazis following the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany in 1938. The looted painting was stored with many other Rothschild treasures in the Austrian salt mines of [[Altaussee]] where they were discovered by the Allies after the war and returned to the Austrian government. Despite many efforts by Alphonse and his heirs, only granddaughter [[Bettina Burr]] was able to achieve restitution. This painting was finally paid for in 1999 after 50 years of "ownership" with a credit line of "donated by Clarice Rothschild in memory of her husband".&lt;ref name=Restitution/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1480069 Lot record 1480069] at Christie's website for Rothschild 1999 sale&lt;/ref&gt;

''Happily Divorced'' is inspired by the real lives of series creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson, who had been high school sweethearts and then married in 1978. They divorced in 1999. Jacobson later [[Coming out|came out]] as gay to Drescher and the two remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/15/fran-dreschers-happily-divorced_n_835851.html |title=Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' Close To TV Land Pickup|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|date=March 15, 2011|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the pair, who had previously created Drescher's earlier series ''[[The Nanny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm Fran Drescher Outs Ex Hubby, Says They're Still Great Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608132145/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm |date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began developing the series based on their life experiences. Initially Drescher planned only to write and produce ''Happily Divorced'' but eventually decided to star as well.  Set in Los Angeles, Fran's gay ex-husband still lives with her for economic reasons, with "a very traditional family. Everyone's very accepting that he's gay. They're both dating; he's new at it, she's new at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyspy.com/modern-family-peter-marc-jacobson-success-sexuality-and-being-love-fran-drescher|title=Modern Family: Peter Marc Jacobson on Success, Sexuality, and Being in Love with Fran Drescher – GuySpy|work=guyspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TV Land gave the [[Green-light|green light]] to a [[television pilot|pilot]] episode in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2010/11/30/TV-Land-greenlights-two-scripted-pilots/UPI-90221291140897/ |title=TV Land greenlights two scripted pilots |publisher=UPI.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network announced on March 21, 2011, that the series had been picked up with a ten-episode order.&lt;ref name = bc /&gt; The show is shot in front of a live studio audience at CBS Radford in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://on-camera-audiences.com/shows/Happily_Divorced |title=Happily Divorced |publisher=On-camera-audiences.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031913?refcatid=4025&amp;printerfriendly=true |title=Producers double down for TV Land – Entertainment News, Headline Newsletter Top Stories, Media |publisher=Variety |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides ''Happily Divorced'' the typical style of the 1990s' sitcoms. There are still more parallels to ''The Nanny'': the opener is an animation, underlaid with specially composed music and also, Drescher refuses a role name and is just called 'Fran'.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |title="Happily Divorced" Starring Fran Drescher Starts Production « TV Land Prime |publisher=Blogs.tvland.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318101836/http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nanny'' regulars, Renée Taylor and Charles Shaughnessy, have made guest appearances; the latter having also co-starred on ''Living With Fran''. The show premiered on Wednesday, June 15, 2011, in the 10:30 time slot after the television show ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com" /&gt;

The show was renewed on July 20, 2011, for a second season of 12 episodes, which started airing weekly on March 7, 2012. The new season is advertised by the slogan "The Laugh is Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back/ |title=Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced Are Back |publisher=TVland.com |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224005056/http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back |archivedate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning of February 2012 TV Land made the guest stars for season 2 public. There are again some famous ''The Nanny'' faces : [[Renée Taylor]] (alias ''Sylvia Fine'') returns from season 1 as Dori's neighbor "Marilyn", and [[Ann Morgan Guilbert|Ann Guilbert]] (alias ''Yetta'') appears as Marilyn's mother, "Mrs. Kapelmaster". Furthermore, Hollywood beauties [[Morgan Fairchild]] and [[Joan Collins]] will be on view as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/morgan-fairchild-guest-star-on-fran-drescher-happily-divorced-1027928.php |title=Morgan Fairchild to guest star on Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' |publisher=Reality TV World |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2012, the day of the [[TV Land Awards]] 2012, the cable broadcaster extended the second season, picking up an additional 12 episodes, bringing the total count of season 2 to 24 episodes. The initial 12 episode order concluded June 6. The 12 additional episodes began airing November 28, 2012, at 10:30 PM EST, following the Season 4 premiere of ''Hot in Cleveland'' at 10 PM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731114013/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was officially cancelled on August 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fran-drescher-comedy-happily-divorced-613711/ |title=Fran Drescher Comedy 'Happily Divorced' Canceled at TV Land |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

Early reviews of the series were mixed. David Hinckley, writing for ''[[The New York Daily News]],'' noted that it "may be that all this will develop an interesting story. On opening night, though, it feels like the show's primary goal is to set up one-liners – which is not how the great shows got to be great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Hinckley|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/06/14/2011-06-14_happily_divorced_review_fran_dreschers_new_tv_land_series_uses_oneliners_gayfrie.html?r=entertainment|title=Fran Drescher's New TV Land Series Uses One-liners, Gay-friendly Jokes|work=[[The New York Daily News]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "so painfully broad and filled with gay stereotypes all but Drescher's most faithful fans will yearn to be separated from their TVs,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Lowry|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945451|title=TV Review &gt; Happily Divorced|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' summed it as "the kind of throwback you just might want to throw back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Gilbert|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-15/ae/29661694_1_peter-marc-jacobson-tv-land-comic-relief|title=Drescher's New Sitcom Sounds Familiar In Several Ways|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark A.

'''''Harold and the Purple Crayon''''' is a 1955 [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Crockett Johnson]]. This is Johnson's most popular book. It led to a series of other books, and inspired many adaptations.

==Plot==
The protagonist, Harold, is a curious four-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Harold and The Purple Crayon Climbs to #1 in iPad Book App Chart in First Week of Release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harold-and-the-purple-crayon-climbs-to-1-in-ipad-book-app-chart-in-first-week-of-release-127225038.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 24, 2014|author=Trilogy Studios|date=August 8, 2011|quote=This timeless classic by Crockett Johnson is about the world a curious four-year-old boy creates by simply drawing it with a purple crayon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; boy who, with his [[purple]] [[crayon]], has the power to create a world of his own simply by drawing it.

Harold wants to go for a walk in the moonlight, but there is no moon, so he draws one. He has nowhere to walk, so he draws a path. He has many adventures looking for his room, and in the end he draws his own house and bed and goes to sleep.

The original story was adapted by [[Weston Woods Studios]] and [[Brandon Films]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bcdb title|57945|Harold and the Purple Crayon (1959)}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a seven-minute [[short film]] in 1959, directed by [[David Piel]] and narrated by [[Norman Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksu.ksu.edu/english/nelp/purple/film.html#harold_and_others.video |title=Crockett Johnson Homepage: Film and Video |publisher=Ksu.ksu.edu |date=2005-08-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1219760|Harold and the Purple Crayon (1959)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Gene Deitch]] directed an animation of ''A Picture for Harold's Room'', and in 1974 an animation of ''Harold's Fairy Tale''. In 1993, these three animations were packaged with a documentary, and sold as the ''Harold and the Purple Crayon and Other Harold Stories'' set.

There have also been theater adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2008/09/24/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/ |title=Harold and the Purple Crayon |publisher=DC Theatre Scene |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004752/http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold|date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[couch gag]] for the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Bob Next Door]]", Harold is shown drawing the Simpson family living room during the regular title sequence. Homer also asks Harold to draw him a can of beer after he finishes with the living room.

In 2011, the story was adapted as an interactive book for the [[iPad]] by [[Trilogy Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/id450829541?mt=8 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In February 2010, it was reported that [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[Will Smith]]'s [[Overbrook Entertainment]] are developing a CGI-animated film adaptation of ''Harold and the Purple Crayon''. It is being produced by Smith and [[James Lassiter]], and written by Josh Klausner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowles|first=Dustin|title=Exclusive: Harold and the Purple Crayon Headed to the Big Screen|url=http://www.pajiba.com/trade_news/harold-and-the-purple-crayon-heading-to-the-big-screen.php|accessdate=August 13, 2011|newspaper=Pajiba|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, it had been reported that the film will also be written by [[Dallas Clayton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/MyTrackingBoard/status/806410462137110528?p=v|title=Twitter |date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The book inspired programmer [[Petri Purho]] to create the computer game ''[[Crayon Physics Deluxe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99080116 |title=Computer Game A Mash-Up Of Crayons, Physics |publisher=NPR |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book potentially inspired the kid's TV show ''[[Chalkzone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binaryjoy.co.uk/games/features/crayon-physics-deluxe-interview/ |title=Crayon Physics Deluxe Interview |publisher=Binary Joy |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used frequently in children's and art education lesson plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsedge.org/content/2488/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212040923/http://www.artsedge.org/content/2488/|date=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 16 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher= ''A Fuse #8 Production''. Blog. [[School Library Journal]] (blog.schoollibraryjournal.com) |date= July 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the protagonists in ''[[Captain Underpants]],'' Harold Hutchins, is named after the protagonist in the book, along with George Beard being named after the protagonist in ''[[Curious George]].''

In Rob Reiner's 1999 romantic comedy ''[[The Story of Us (film)|The Story of Us]]'', Kate (Michelle Pfeiffer) says that ''Harold and the Purple Crayon'' is one of her favorite books and an allegory for her marriage with Ben (Bruce Willis). She later explains that Ben just wouldn't "share the crayon," and that she feels she has been living in ''his'' world rather than one she had helped create.

'''Henri Alfred Marie Jacquemart''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi alfʁɛd maʁi ʒakmaʁ}}) (24 February 1824 in [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; 4 January 1896 in Paris),&lt;ref&gt;Benezit, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Le Figaro'', 6 Jan 1896, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; often known as '''Alfred Jacquemart''', was a noted French sculptor and [[animalier]]. He usually signed his works: ''A. Jacquemart''.

Jacquemart studied under painter [[Paul Delaroche]] and sculptor Jean Baptiste Jules Klagmann.&lt;ref&gt;Benezit, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1845.

Jacquemart exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] from 1847–1879, receiving medals in 1857, 1863 and 1865. He traveled in Egypt and Turkey, and was commissioned by the city of Alexandria, Egypt, to create a colossal statue of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]].

He sculpted in large, medium and small scale. Many of his works were cast in bronze by the [[:fr:Val d'Osne|Val d' Osne foundry]] and some by the silversmith [[Christofle]].&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p.408&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, he earned his reputation for his many larger animal works. In 1870 Jacquemart became a Chevalier of the [[Légion d'honneur]].

Jacquemart died suddenly at his apartment in the Rue de Babylone, Paris on the night of 4 January 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''La Croix'', 7 Jan 1896, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was delayed until 13 January for the arrival of his son, Maurice, who lived in Tunis and was held at the Eglise Saint Thomas d'Aquin, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''La Presse'', 8 Jan 1896, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La Temps'', 6 Jan 1896, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Ballet''' (香港芭蕾舞團) is a classical ballet company founded in 1979.

== History ==

The Company was created in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2009/06/hong-kong-ballet-dances-through-the-galaxy|title=Hong Kong Ballet Dances Through The Galaxy|website=Luxury-insider.com|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, The Hong Kong Ballet has concluded more than 30 tours to 10 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

In January 2010, Faye Leung, the Company's former top ballerina, revealed in a book that she was sacked from the HK Ballet on suspicious that she was dividing dancers and organizing a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/704083/i-was-sacked-splitting-hk-ballet-dancer-writes|title=I was sacked for splitting HK Ballet, dancer writes|website=Scmp.com|date=19 January 2010|author=Olga Wong|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Company took part in Expo 2010 Shanghai, presenting a mixed bill production and performing as part of Festive Hong Kong Celebration.  The Hong Kong Ballet’s dancers also performed at the 4th and 5th International Dance Festivals held in Cali, Colombia; the 50th Anniversary International Gala in Brisbane, Australia; and the International Ballettgala XI in Dortmund, Germany. Most recently, the Company presented ''Firecracker'' in Macau in January 2012. In the summer of 2012, The Hong Kong Ballet toured the United States and Canada with a mixed bill featuring two specially commissioned contemporary ballets. The Company made its debut appearance at [[Jacob’s Pillow]] Dance Festival and then performed in Aspen, Montreal and Santa Fe.

In June 2017, Septime Webre, of Cuban-American origins, previously the artistic director of [[The Washington Ballet]] for 17 years, was named Artistic Director of the Ballet. For 2018, he planned a contemporary program which featured the music of the [[Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/why-septime-webre-believes-the-beatles-and-the-ballet-are-a-perfect-match|title=Why Septime Webre Believes The Beatles And The Ballet Are A Perfect Match|website=Asiatatler.com|date=26 February 2018|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also organized ''Ballet in the City'', outdoors dancing events in different art galleries of the city, and a series of other events "to insert the company and its dancers into the social fabric of the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zolimacitymag.com/septime-webre-has-three-years-to-make-ballet-relevant-to-hong-kong-heres-how-hell-do-it/|title=Septime Webre has 3 years to make ballet relevant to Hong Kong: here's how he'll do it|website=Zolimacitymag.com|date=9 November 2017|author=Simon Cartledge|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== Repertoire ===

The Company performs a repertoire that combines 19th to 21st century classical, contemporary works and newly commissioned ballets.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the Archive is to document the history of [[women in architecture|women's involvement in architecture]] by acquiring, preserving, storing, and making available to researchers the professional papers of women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural historians and critics, urban planners, and the records of women's architectural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zellner|first=Paola|year=2016|title=El Archivo Internacional de Mujeres en Arquitectura celebra 30 años: una nueva visión|url=|journal=Bitácora Arquitectura|publisher=UNAM|volume=33|pages=16–23|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
The IAWA collects the papers of women who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field (i.e., before the 1950s) and to fill serious gaps in the availability of primary research materials for architectural, women's, and social history research. As of October 2006 there were over {{convert|1200|cuft|m3}} of materials in the 298 collections in the IAWA, which are housed in Virginia Tech's University Libraries' Special Collections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of its mission to act as a clearinghouse of information about all women architects, past and present, the IAWA also collects and catalogs books, monographs and other publications written by or about women architects, designers, planners, etc. These publications are accessible through the Virginia Tech library's online catalog, Addison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://addison.vt.edu/|title=Addison: Search|website=addison.vt.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAWA began with a collecting focus on the papers of pioneering women in architecture, individuals who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field. Today, the IAWA includes materials that document multiple generations of women in architecture, providing vital primary source materials for architectural, women's, and social history research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/unforgetting-women-architects-from-the-pritzker-to-wikipedia/|title=Unforgetting Women Architects: From the Pritzker to Wikipedia|last=Stratigakos|first=Despina|date=April 2016|website=Places|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections includes material of relevant women architects as [[Jane Hastings|L. Jane Hastings]], [[Anna Keichline]], [[Yasmeen Lari]], [[Doina Marilena Ciocănea]], [[Eleanore Pettersen]], [[Sigrid Lorenzen Rupp]], [[Beverly Willis]], [[Diana Balmori]], [[Han Schröder]], [[Mary Colter]], [[Zelma Wilson]], [[Liane Zimbler]], Trudy Rosen, Pamela Webb, [[Berta Rahm]], and [[Olive Chadeayne]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The IAWA also compiles biographical information. There is information about more than 650 women representing 48 countries and 42 states/territories in the United States available in the IAWA Biographical Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iawadb.lib.vt.edu/|title=IAWA Biographical Database|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the IAWA's resources, approximately 1200 images from 28 collections, have been scanned and are available through the VT ImageBase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imagebase.lib.vt.edu/browse.php?folio_ID=/iawa|title=Browsing International Archive of Women in Architecture - IAWA|last=|first=|date=|website=Imagebase.

== Board ==
The IAWA is overseen by a board of advisors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/BOA.html|title=IAWA (International Archive of Women in Architecture) Board of Advisors, Virginia Tech|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes architects, city planners, industrial and interior designers, librarians, archivists, and faculty from around the world and the U.S. The head of Special Collections or her designee serves as the Archivist for the IAWA and sits on the Board of Advisors and the Executive Board. She prepares a report for presentation to the annual meeting held in the fall of each year at Virginia Tech's Newman Library in the President's Board Room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Milka Bliznakov Research Prize ==
The Milka Bliznakov Research Prize was established in 2001 to honor IAWA founder and advisor emerita, Dr. [[Milka Bliznakov]] (1927-2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolina|first=Anna|year=|title=In Memoriam: Milka Bliznakov, 1927-2010|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=70-2 (Summer 2011)|pages=498–499.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAWA Center invites architects, scholars, professionals, students, and researchers to contribute research on women in architecture and related design fields. This research, in concert with the preservation efforts of the IAWA, will help fill the current void in historical knowledge about the achievements and work of women who shaped the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/Bliznakov/Bliznakov.html|title=Milka Bliznakov Research Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters from the Earth''''' is a posthumously published work of celebrated American author [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) collated by [[Bernard DeVoto]].&lt;ref name="aboutMTP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Project History |url=http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_projecthistory.shtml |website=www.marktwainproject.org |publisher=Mark Twain Project |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain's life (1904–09), when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a sarcastic — Twain's own term throughout the book — tone. Initially, another of his daughters, [[Clara Clemens]], objected to its publication in March 1939,&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion, claiming it presented a ''"distorted"''&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962book"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with [[Soviet]] reports that her father's ideas were being suppressed in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt;  The papers were selected, edited and sequenced for the book in 1939 by [[Bernard DeVoto]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt;

==Content==
''Letters from the Earth'' consists of a series of commentaries in essay and short story form. Many of these pieces express Twain's discomfort with and disdain for Christianity, both as a theological position and a lifestyle. The title story consists of eleven letters written by the [[archangel]] [[Satan]] to archangels [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other pieces in the book include a [[morality tale]] told as a bedtime discussion with Twain's children, Susy and Clara, about a family of cats, and an essay explaining why an [[anaconda]] is morally superior to Man.

==Date of writing==
''Letters from the Earth'' was written after the deaths of Twain's daughter [[Susy Clemens|Suzy]] (1896) and of his wife [[Olivia Langdon Clemens|Olivia]] (1904). Textual references make clear that sections, at least, of ''Letters from the Earth'' were written shortly before his death in April 1910. (For instance, Letter VII, in discussing the ravages of [[hookworm]], refers to the $1,000,000 gift of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] to help eradicate the disease – a gift that was announced on October 28, 1909, less than six months before Twain's death.&lt;ref name="RockefellerArticle"&gt;{{citation |title = Rockefeller Gift To Kill 'Hookworm' |periodical = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | page = 1 | date = October 29, 1909 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/10/29/101902851.pdf | accessdate = 2010-03-05 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the following excerpt appears in a discussion of the Palestinian town of Nablous, in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''. This passage was written more than four decades before his death, in 1867 or 1868, and appears to be an oblique reference to the idea that later became ''Letters from the Earth.'' 
{{cquote|Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community is a MSS. copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest document on earth. It is written on vellum, and is some four or five thousand years old. Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight. Its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast upon it. Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from the high priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished translating it.}}

Louis J. Budd, editor of ''Mark Twain: Collected Tales, Sketches, Speeches, and Essays: Volume 2: 1891-1910'' (1992), a volume in the [[Library of America]] series, places ''Letters from the Earth'' sequentially in 1909.

==Dramatic adaptations==
A stage adaptation of ''Letters from the Earth'' by [[Dan Savage]] was produced in [[Seattle]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiley|first=Brendan|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/on-stage/Content?oid=13727 |title=On Stage Killer Dickens, Trite Twain, Nifty Neel, Limp Lonergan |date= March 2003 |publisher=The Stranger|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected Quotations==
{{cquote|The Creator sat upon the throne, thinking. Behind him stretched the illimitable continent of heaven, steeped in a glory of light and color; before him rose the black night of Space, like a wall. His mighty bulk towered rugged and mountain-like into the zenith, and His divine head blazed there like a distant sun. At His feet stood three colossal figures, diminished to extinction, almost, by contrast -- archangels -- their heads level with His ankle-bone.}}

{{cquote|In time, the Deity perceived that death was a mistake; a mistake, in that it was insufficient; insufficient, for the reason that while it was an admirable agent for the inflicting of misery upon the survivor, it allowed the dead person himself to escape from all further persecution in the blessed refuge of the grave. This was not satisfactory. A way must be conceived to pursue the dead beyond the tomb.}}

{{cquote|Man is a marvelous curiosity. When he is at his very, very best he is a sort of low grade nickel-plated angel; at his worst he is unspeakable, unimaginable; and first and last and all the time he is a sarcasm.}}
{{cquote|He took a pride in man; man was his finest invention; man was his pet, after the housefly . . . .}}
{{cquote|(On the Bible) It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies.}}

Letter VIII on "the law of God" expressed by each gender's physical construction:
{{cquote|(women) There shall be no limit put upon your intercourse with the other sex sexually, at any time of life .. During twenty-three days in every month (in absence of pregnancy) from the time a woman is seven years old till she dies of old age, she is ready for action, and competent. As competent as the candlestick is to receive the candle. Competent every day, competent every night. Also she wants that candle -- yearns for it, longs for it, hankers after it, as commanded by the law of God in her heart .. her plant has to be out of service three days in the month, and during a part of her pregnancy. These are times of discomfort, often of suffering. For fair and just compensation she has the high privilege of unlimited adultery all the other days of her life. (on a 50 year old man's great grand mother) as good as new. There is nothing the matter with her plant. Her candlestick is as firm as ever}}
{{cquote|(men) During your entire life you shall be under inflexible limits and restrictions, sexually .. man is only briefly competent; and only then in the moderate measure applicable to the word in his sex's case. He is competent from the age of sixteen or seventeen thence-forward for thirty-five years. After fifty his performance is of poor quality, the intervals between are wide, and its satisfactions of no great value to either party .. his candle is increasingly softened and weakened by the weather of age, as the years go by, until at last it can no longer stand, and is mournfully laid to rest in the hope of a blessed resurrection which is never to come.}}

==Theatre censorship==
The [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s Office had a more significant role in British society prior to 1968, as it was the official [[censorship|censor]] for virtually all theatre performed in Britain. Commercial theatre owners were generally satisfied by the safety this arrangement gave them; so long as they presented only licensed plays they were effectively immune from prosecution for any offence a play might cause.  There were campaigns by playwrights, however, in opposition to the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, such as those involving [[J. M. Barrie]] in 1909 and 1911. Some plays were not licensed in the 1930s, during the period of [[appeasement]], because they were critical of the German Nazi regime and it was feared that allowing certain plays to be performed might alienate what was still thought of as a friendly government.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Steve|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/21/royal-household-suppressed-anti-nazi-theatre-1930s|title=Theatre of war: how the monarchy suppressed anti-Nazi drama in the 1930s|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], then Lord Chamberlain, regularly consulted the Foreign Office and sometimes, the German Embassy. In the latter case, the submissions were intended to be read by a "friendly German".&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

By the 1960s, there were many playwrights and [[theatrical producer|producer]]s who wished to produce controversial works such as ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. Theatre companies such as the [[Royal Court Theatre]] came into open conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Sometimes they would resort to such measures as declaring themselves private clubs for the performance of certain plays. The Lord Chamberlain's Office technically had jurisdiction over private performances, but had generally avoided getting involved with bona-fide private clubs. The various activist groups did not actually come up with solid legal loopholes, but the publicity they generated eventually resulted in the abolition of the role of official censor in the [[Theatres Act 1968]].

[[File:Señor de la Capilla, Tequixquiac (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Señor de la Capilla]]

The '''Lord of the Chapel''', (in Spanish as ''Señor de la Capilla'' and [[Otomi language|Otomi]] as ''Zidada Nikjä''), is a statue of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] from [[Santiago Apóstol Parish (Tequixquiac)|Saint James Apostle parish]] in [[Santiago Tequixquiac]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM15mexico/municipios/15096a.html] Tequixquiac, INADEP.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by illness and epidemics with Indigenous people. It became the [[patron saint]] of Santiago Tequixquiac, and is one of the most well-known images in Mexico State. It was probably created in Actopan ex-monastery by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The author is unknown and belongs to the Spanish colonial period.

The Christ image dates from the first half of the seventeenth century and measures 1.73 meters high. There is a strong relationship with Cryptojudaism because in this town its first Iberian inhabitants were Sephardic converts to Christianity arrived with [[Hernán Cortés]]; in the face of the image are very obvious a Rabbinical signs, one of them are [[payot]]s or cailers in the hair.

== History ==

During the Spanish colonial period, several Christs, carved with cane paste, were sculpted; it was an indigenous sculptural tradition that prevailed in New Spain when constructing lighter religious images; These Christs were in various parishes of the region, one in El Arenal, Actopan (Lord of the Wonders), anothers in the village of Visitación (Lord of Tlapala), in Amecameca (Lord of the Sacromonte) and other in Chalma (Lord of Chalma). This image was inside a chapel in Saint Francis parish, in the town of Apaxco that later the image was moved to the people from Tequixquiac until our days.

== Description ==
The image has a cross made of walnut and details of ivory called tablets that were brought from the Philippines.

'''Made-to-measure''' (MTM) typically refers to custom clothing that is cut and sewn using a standard-sized base pattern. [[Suit (clothing)|Suits]] and [[sport coat]]s are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a [[ready-to-wear]] garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. 
Made-to-measure garments always involve some form of [[standardization]] in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas [[bespoke tailoring]] is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. 
All else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. "Custom made" most often refers to MTM. [[Country of origin]] makes a difference in pricing, with [[made in China]] MTM garments typically priced below [[made in Italy]] ready-to-wear.

== Overview ==
To order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.

The primary benefits to the customer of made-to-measure clothing are that the garments will be well-fitted to the customer's body and the customer may have the opportunity to customize the fabric and detailing. The primary disadvantage of made-to-measure is that the customer must wait up to several weeks for the garment to be sewn and delivered. A typical price markup for a made-to-measure item is 15% over the price of its ready-to-wear counterpart.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Made-to-measure retailers often travel internationally meeting clients in cities, providing samples of the latest materials and styles.

Unlike [[bespoke tailoring|bespoke]] garments, which traditionally involves hand sewing, made-to-measure manufacturers use both machine- and hand-sewing. Made-to-measure also requires fewer fittings than bespoke, resulting in a shorter wait between customer measurement and garment delivery.

Made-to-measure is sometimes also referred to as personal [[tailoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6e1c54-df24-11db-b5c9-000b5df10621.html|title=Just how personal can you get|last=Brooke|first=Simon|date=March 31, 2007|work=Financial Times|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years tailoring has evolved further with young companies like Artefact London, that make a blend of made-to-measure and bespoke approaches. A base pattern is used to gauge your measurements and your unique pattern is created electronically with all alterations accounted for prior to cutting. Thus alleviating the need for baste fitting that is mandatory in bespoke with very minor alterations (if any) needed at the fitting.

== Advertising Standards Authority ruling ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the legal definition of “made-to-measure” has been conflated with [[bespoke tailoring]] by a ruling of the  [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |title=Sartoriani London |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122150946/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is based on the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] definition of bespoke as "made to order".  While this ruling clarified the difference between bespoke and ready-to-wear, it had the effect of blurring the line between bespoke and made-to-measure.

The ruling established that a "made-to-measure suit would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements," while "a bespoke suit would be fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit." The ruling concluded, however, that a "majority of people... would not expect that bespoke suit to be fully hand-made with the pattern cut from scratch," effectively equalizing the terms bespoke and made-to-measure.

While etymologist Michael Quinion observed that by definition "it was legitimate for a tailor offering clothes cut and sewn by machine to refer to them as bespoke, provided that they were made to the customer's measurements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |publisher=Michael Quinion |date= September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the traditional use of bespoke inside the tailoring community has been more nuanced than the Oxford definition,&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Manuel de civilité pour les petites filles à l'usage des maisons d'éducation''''' (English: ''Handbook of behaviour for little girls to be used in educational establishments'')&lt;ref&gt;There is no punctuation in the French title and therefore not in the English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;tr. Sabine D’Estrée, ''A Handbook...''&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[erotic literature|erotic literary work]] by the French writer [[Pierre Louÿs]], written in 1917 and published posthumously and anonymously in 1927.

It takes the form of a parody of the rigorous educational handbooks of the time, and is thus composed of short pieces of advice (generally a sentence or two) arranged into topics: "At home", "Duties towards your mother", "In class", etc. The tone of the work is sharp, even concise, the style particularly believable and chatty. Pierre Louÿs uses irony readily to evoke the cheap loves of the perverse young girls, and this relative distance enables him to despise any moral censure ([[incest]], [[paedophilia]]...). In fact, one is far from the invaluable refinement of the ''[[Songs of Bilitis]]'' for example.  The ''Handbook of civility'' is undoubtedly the most [[subversive]] work of Louÿs, a true attack against the middle-class [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] of the [[Belle Époque]].

By the way of illustration, the "[[Glossary]]" which opens the work comprises this warning:&lt;blockquote&gt;We have considered it useless to explain the words: [[cunt]], slit, [[wikt:fanny|fanny]], mound, [[penis|cock]], tail, [[bollock]], [[testicle]], [[orgasm|cum]] (verb), [[semen|cum]] (noun), [[erection]], [[masturbate]], suck, [[licking|lick]], [[pump]], [[kiss]], [[fellate]], [[screw]], [[fuck]], [[Anal sex|ass-fuck]], [[ejaculate]], [[dildo]], [[lesbian]], [[dyke (slang)|dyke]], [[69 (sex position)|sixty-nine]], [[cunnilingus]], [[cuteness|cute]], [[whore]], [[brothel]]. These words are familiar to all little girls.&lt;ref&gt;French: ''Nous avons jugé inutile d'expliquer les mots : con, fente, moniche, motte, pine, queue, bitte, couille, foutre (verbe), foutre (subst.), bander, branler, sucer, lécher, pomper, baiser, piner, enfiler, enconner, enculer, décharger, godmiché, gougnotte, gousse, soixante-neuf, minette, mimi, putain, bordel. Ces mots-là sont familiers à toutes les petites filles.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The edition of the work published at Librio is marked "for informed readers". Some of the book’s counsels were illustrated by cartoonist [[Loïc Dubigeon]] under the title of ''Handbook of behaviour for the use of "big" girls''.

'''Monochromacy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mono'', meaning "one "and ''chromo'', meaning "color") is the ability of organisms or machines to distinguish only one single frequency of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic light spectrum]]. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic but can be considered as a [[gaussian distribution]] of frequencies shaped around a peak. In the same way, a visual system of an organism or a machine cannot be monochromat but will distinguish a continuous set of frequencies around a peak, depending by the intensity of the light. Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats.

Many species, such as all [[marine mammal]]s, the [[owl monkey]] and the [[Australian sea lion]] (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In [[human]]s, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited [[achromatopsia]] ([[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] 216900 262300 139340 613093), acquired achromatopsia or inherited [[blue cone monochromacy]] (OMIM 303700).

==Humans==
Vision in humans is due to a system that starts with [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] photoreceptors, passes through [[retinal ganglion cells]] and arrives in the brain [[visual cortex]]. [[Color vision]] is achieved through cone cells, each one able to distinguish between a continuous band of frequencies, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex.

Rods, which are extremely abundant (about 120 million), are in the periphery of the human retina. Rods respond only to faint levels of light and are very light sensitive, therefore, completely useless in daylight because bright light bleaches them.&lt;ref name="Kalat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalat|first=James|title=Biological Psychology|year=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|isbn=978-1-111-83100-4|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cones, which are mostly near the [[fovea centralis|fovea]] in the eye and are less active in dim light, more useful in bright light, are essential for color vision.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; There are three types of cones in normal human eyes (short, medium and long wavelength, sometimes called blue, green and red); each detects a different range of wavelengths. Rods outnumber cones by about 20 to 1 in the human retina, but cones provide about 90% of the brain's input.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Cones respond faster than rods and have three types of pigments with different color sensitivities, where rods only have one and so are achromatic (colorless).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt;

These types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of [[Visual phototransduction|phototransduction]]:&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neitz|first1=J|last2=Neitz|first2=M|title=The genetics of normal and defective color vision|journal=Vision Res.|date=2011|volume=51|issue=7|pages=633–651|pmid=21167193|pmc=3075382|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Anomalous trichromacy]], when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity but [[trichromacy]] (distinguishing color by both the green-red and blue-yellow distinctions) is not fully impaired.
#[[Dichromacy]], when one of the cone pigments is missing and colour is reduced to the green-red distinction only or the blue-yellow distinction only.
# Monochromacy, when two of the cones are not functional. Vision reduced to blacks, whites, and greys.
# Rod Monochromacy ([[Achromatopsia]].), when all three of the cones are non functional and light perception is achieved only with rod cells. Color vision is heavily or completely impaired, vision reduced to seeing only the level of light coming from an object. [[Dyschromatopsia]] is a less severe type of achromatopsia.

Monochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human [[retina]] is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired [[achromatopsia]], inherited autosomal recessive [[achromatopsia]] and [[Sex linkage#X-linked recessive inheritance|recessive X-linked]] [[blue cone monochromacy]].&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Davenport|first2=C M|last3=Maumenee|first3=I H|last4=Lewis|first4=R A|last5=Hejtmancik|first5=J F|last6=Litt|first6=M|last7=Lovrien|first7=E|last8=Weleber|first8=R|last9=Bachynski|first9=B|last10=Zwas|first10=F|last11=Klingaman|first11=R|last12=Fishman|first12=G|title=Molecular genetics of human blue cone monochromacy|journal=Science|date=1989|volume=245|issue=4920|pages=831–838|pmid=2788922|doi=10.1126/science.2788922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Maumenee|first2=I H|last3=Zrenner|first3=E|last4=Sadowski|first4=B|last5=Sharpe|first5=L T|last6=Lewis|first6=R A|last7=Hansen|first7=E|last8=Rosenberg|first8=T|last9=Schwartz|first9=M|last10=Heckenlively|first10=J R|last11=Trabulsi|first11=E|last12=Klingaman|first12=R|last13=Bech-Hansen|first13=N T|last14=LaRoche|first14=G R|last15=Pagon|first15=R A|last16=Murphey|first16=W H|last17=Weleber|first17=R G|title=Genetic heterogeneity among blue-cone monochromats|journal=Am.

*Rod monochromacy (RM), also called [[Achromatopsia#Congenital|congenital complete achromatopsia]] or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an [[autosomal recessive]]ly inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, [[Photophobia|photo-aversion]] and [[nystagmus]].

Also see [[Pingelap#Color-blindness]].
*Cone monochromacy (CM) is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only having one functioning type of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues.

In humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones&lt;ref name="NATHA1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Thomas|first2=D|last3=Hogness|first3=D S|title=Molecular genetics of human color vision: the genes encoding blue, green, and red pigments|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=232|issue=4747|pages=193–202|pmid=2937147|doi=10.1126/science.2937147}}&lt;/ref&gt; have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class:

#Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the [[fovea centralis|fovea]]. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is less than 1 in 1 million.
#Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, RCM is also present in less than 1 in 1 million people. Animal research studies have shown that the nocturnal wolf and ferret have lower densities of L-cone receptors.&lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt;

*Cone monochromacy, type II, if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice, it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species.

==Animals that are monochromats==
It used to be confidently claimed that most [[mammal]]s other than [[primate]]s were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, evidence of at least [[dichromat]]ic color vision in a number of mammalian [[order (biology)|orders]] has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of [[sea mammals]], the [[pinniped]]s (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and [[cetacean]]s (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals.{{dubious|lacking the 2 S cone could make them dichromats|date=January 2014}} The same is true of the [[owl monkey]]s, genus ''Aotus''.

Researchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: [[raccoon]], [[crab-eating raccoon]] and [[kinkajou]] and a few [[rodents]] are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone.&lt;ref name="Peichl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peichl|first=Leo|last2=Behrmann |first2=Gunther |last3=Kroger |first3=Ronald H.

They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, "Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)" &lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt; Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins.

==Monochromat capability==
According to [[Jay Neitz]], a renowned color vision researcher at the [[University of Washington]], each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s can pick up about 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors.&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web

The '''National Trust for Historic Preservation''' is a privately funded, [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], that works in the field of [[historic preservation]] in the [[United States]]. The member-supported organization was founded in 1949 by [[congressional charter]] to support the preservation of America’s diverse historic buildings, neighborhoods, and heritage through its programs, resources, and advocacy.

==Overview==
[[File:WatergateFromAir.JPG|thumb|The National Trust for Historic Preservation is headquartered in the [[Watergate complex]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The National Trust for Historic Preservation aims to empower local preservationists by providing leadership to save and revitalize America's historic places, and by working on both national policies as well as local preservation campaigns through its network of field offices and preservation partners, including the [[National Park Service]], [[State historic preservation office|State Historic Preservation Offices]], and local preservation groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://savingplaces.org/we-are-saving-places|title=We’re Saving Places {{!}} National Trust for Historic Preservation|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Trust is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], with field offices in [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Denver]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Canby, Oregon|Canby]] (near [[Portland, Oregon]]), and [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation. [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/field-offices.html "Field Offices."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is governed by a [[board of trustees]] and led by current president, [[Stephanie K. Meeks]].&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation. [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/trustees.html "Board of Trustees."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Trust presently{{When|date=October 2017}} has around 750,000 members and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation. [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/history.html "A Brief History of the National Trust."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to leading campaigns and advocacy, the National Trust provides a growing educational resource through the Preservation Leadership Forum that offers articles, journals, case studies, and conferences and training. The National Trust issues the quarterly [[Preservation (magazine)|''Preservation'']] magazine and produces the "PreservationNation" blog.

The National Trust’s current work focuses on building [[sustainable communities]] through the [[adaptive reuse]] of historic spaces; preserving and empowering [[cultural diversity]] through protecting sites of cultural significance; advocating for greater [[stewardship]] of historic places on [[public land]]; and leading innovation in the management of historic properties.

==History==
[[File:Andrew Mellon Building - Dupont Circle.JPG|thumb|The National Trust for Historic Preservation's former headquarters of 35 years, the [[Andrew Mellon Building]], located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]] The National Trust moved its headquarters to the [[Watergate complex]] in 2013.]]
Towards the end of the 19th century, as the United States was rebuilding after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the country was beginning to form its sense of national identity and history. The government began to enact legislation for the preservation of sites and objects deemed significant to the nation’s history. In 1872, an [[Act of Congress]] established the first [[National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]].&lt;ref name="Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6"&gt;{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the [[Antiquities Act]] enabled the President to declare landmarks or objects as a [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]].&lt;ref name="Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6"/&gt; Then in 1935, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]] which outlined programs for research and inventory of historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, historic preservation initiatives existed on local and state levels. In 1931, the first [[historic district]] was created in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, efforts to save and maintain historic sites were still largely limited to private citizens or local groups.

In the late 1940s, leaders in American historic preservation saw the need for a national organization to support local preservation efforts. In 1946, [[David E. Finley, Jr.]], [[George McAneny]], Christopher Crittenden, and Ronald Lee met at the [[National Gallery of Art]] to discuss the formation of such a national organization.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.2"&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was followed by a larger gathering on April 15, 1947, attended by representatives from a number of art, architectural, and [[historical societies]], which culminated in the creation of the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.2"/&gt; The meeting’s attendants became the first charter members of the Council.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.3"&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization’s first headquarters was in the offices of [[Ford’s Theatre|Ford’s Theatre (Lincoln Museum)]] in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council then pursued the formation of a National Trust for Historic Preservation, somewhat modeled on the British [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which would be tasked with the acquisition and maintenance of historic properties.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.3"/&gt; The creation of the National Trust was proposed as a bill to Congress, H.R. 5170, introduced by Congressman J. Hardin Peterson of Florida and passed.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.5"&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Trust for Historic Preservation was formally established through the Act of Congress when President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the legislation on October 26, 1949. The charter provided that the Trust should acquire and preserve historic sites and objects of national significance and provide annual reports to Congress on its activities.&lt;ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.5"/&gt; Finley served as the National Trust's first chairman of the board, remaining in the position for 12 years.&lt;ref name="Remembering Louise Crowninshield."&gt;Burdick, Kim (2000). [http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/remembering-louise-crowninshield.html "Remembering Louise Crowninshield."] ''Forum Journal'' '''14 (3).'''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodlawn August 2003 A.jpg|thumb|right|[[Woodlawn (plantation)|Woodlawn Plantation]] &amp; [[Loren Pope Residence|Pope-Leighey House]], [[Alexandria, Virginia]] was the first site acquired into the National Trust portfolio.]] The National Trust and the National Council existed side by side for several years until the need to merge resources compelled the Executive Committee to integrate the two entities. In 1952, the boards of both organizations approved a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of the Council into the National Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was effective the following year and was completed by 1956.&lt;ref name="Remembering Louise Crowninshield."/&gt; The National Trust became a membership organization and assumed all other functions of the National Council.

In its early years, the National Trust’s founders envisioned an organization whose primary purpose would be the acquisition and administration of historic sites, while encouraging public participation in their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the National Trust officially acquired its first property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in northern [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, the National Trust portfolio of historic properties and contracted affiliates include twenty-seven historic sites, ranging from the 18th-century [[Drayton Hall]] in [[South Carolina]] to the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] [[Glass House]] in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation (2014). [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/trustees.html "Sites."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, the National Trust grew to become the leading national organization in historic preservation. They began working with citizens and city planning officials on legislative matters, including federal, state, and municipal ordinances for historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Trust staff also traveled to parts of the country to advise local communities on preservation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Congress passed the [[National Historic Preservation Act]], a significant legislation for the preservation movement. The Act also provided federal funding in support of the National Trust’s work. The funding later ceased in 1996, at which point the National Trust became entirely privately funded.

Following the adoption of the National Historic Preservation Act, the National Trust broadened in its mission beyond administrating historic sites. In 1969, the National Trust created the Preservation Services Fund to provide financial assistance to local preservation projects.&lt;ref name="preservationnation.org"&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation (2014). [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/history.html "A Brief History of the National Trust."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the National Trust opened its first field office in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="preservationnation.org"/&gt; As the organization grew, the National Trust expanded its work, consisting of programs, educational resources, and advocacy. In 1980, the National Trust initiated the National Main Street Center, specializing in revitalizing historic business districts, which has since transitioned into a subsidiary.&lt;ref name="preservationnation.org"/&gt;

[[File:Glasshouse-philip-johnson.jpg|thumb|The portfolio of National Trust sites has expanded to include Phillip Johnson's [[Glass House]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut]].]]
In 2010, Stephanie Meeks became the organization’s president, replacing [[Richard Moe]] who had led the organization for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Trescott, Jacqueline (June 15, 2010). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/14/AR2010061402717.html "Stephanie Meeks to Lead the National Trust for Historic Preservation."] ''The Washington Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; The change brought a shift in direction of the National Trust’s work towards a more focused, cause-based approach and involved more robust outreach to local preservationists. As part of this new approach, the National Trust initiated the National Treasures portfolio that specifically identifies threatened sites and strategizes efforts to preserve them.

In 2013, the National Trust headquarters moved from the [[Andrew Mellon Building]] on 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, NW in Washington D.C.’s [[Dupont Circle]] to the historic [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;O’Connell, Jonathan (June 17, 2013). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-business/post/national-trust-for-historic-preservation-moving-offices-to-the-watergate/2013/06/27/b03b5e82-df60-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_blog.html "National Trust for Historic Preservation moving offices to the Watergate."] ''The Washington Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the move, Meeks said in a statement, "The selection of the Watergate demonstrates our ongoing commitment to recognizing and protecting important places from every era in American history, including the recent past." &lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Currently, the National Trust’s programs include National Treasures, launched in 2011, which campaigns to save threatened historic landmarks, and the annual list of America's [[America's Most Endangered Places|11 Most Endangered Historic Places]], first issued in 1988, which highlights endangered sites across the country.

===National Treasures===
Initiated in 2011, the National Treasures program identifies historically significant landmarks that face imminent threat. With the support of local preservationists, the National Trust leads direct action to save these sites through fundraising, coalition building, and legal advocacy. The sites are selected based on criteria including: integrity, contribution to America’s diverse history, and preservation strategies that can be applied to other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/org-assessment-docs/NationalTreasuresSelectionProcessOverview120211.pdf |title=National Treasures: Selection Process Overview|accessdate=December 2,  2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing portfolio of National Treasures includes:
*[[Fort Monroe]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]
*[[Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, California]]
* [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]]
*[[Miami Marine Stadium]] in [[Miami, Florida]]
*The historic [[Rosenwald School]]s built in the early 19th century to educate African-American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://savingplaces.org/ |title=National Treasures|accessdate= January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===11 Most Endangered Historic Places List===
{{Main|America's Most Endangered Places}}
First published in 1988, the National Trust’s list of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places is an annual list that highlights endangered historic sites across the United States. The list serves to raise national awareness of these sites. The sites are nominated by the public and eventually selected based on a range of factors, including its significance, whether there is a local group engaged in its preservation, the urgency of the threat, and potential solutions to that threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/11-most-endangered/about-america-s-11-most-endangered-historic-places.html |title=About America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places|website=PreservationNation.org|accessdate= September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation Leadership Forum and resources===
The  National Trust for Historic Preservation organizes the Preservation Leadership Forum, a network of preservation professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://forum.savingplaces.org/join]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic Hotels of America===

Historic Hotels of America identifies hotels that have maintained their authenticity, sense of place, and architectural integrity. The program includes over 260 members in 44 states, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=hha&gt;{{cite journal|title=About Historic Hotels of America|url=http://www.historichotels.org/about-historic-hotels/|publisher=Historic Hotels of America|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Trust for Historic Preservation created Historic Hotels of America in 1989 with 32 charter members.&lt;ref name="hha"/&gt;

To be included in the program, hotels must be at least 50 years old; designated by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior as a [[National Historic Landmark]] or listed in or eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]];&lt;ref name=NRA&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognized as having historic significance.

==Advocacy==
The National Trust’s advocacy arm works to effect policy at the local, state, and federal level. Current advocacy priorities are:

=== Historic Tax Credit (HTC) and Creating American Prosperity through Preservation (CAPP) Act ===
The Historic Tax Credit (HTC) is the federal tax credit program that incentivizes the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The HTC, which has rehabilitated more than 38,700 buildings and leveraged about $106 billion in private investment nationwide, is in danger of being eliminated in current budget-balancing discussions in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Retrieved 2014-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Trust and its partners advocate for the Creating American Prosperity through Preservation (CAPP) Act to preserve the tax credit policy.

=== Federal transportation legislation ===
The federal Department of Transportation Act of 1966 included Section 4(f), which stipulates that planners must develop projects that protect or avoid historic resources. However, Section 4(f) is periodically challenged through the transportation reauthorization process, most recently during the consideration of MAP-21.&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation.

{{nihongo|'''Nemuri-neko''' (眠り猫 or 眠猫, "sleeping cat", from ''nemuri'', "sleeping/peaceful" and ''neko'', "cat")}} is a famous [[wood carving]] by [[Hidari Jingorō]] (左甚五郎の作) located in the East corridor at [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū Shrine]] (日光東照宮) in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]].

The Japanese sleeping cat is modeled after the famous crouching nemurineko{{clarifyme | reason = which, if either, of 'the Japanese sleeping cat' and 'the famous crouching nemurineko' is the sculpture at Tōshō-gū Shrine mentioned earlier?|date=December 2012}} carving by Hidari Jingorō.
Based on the writing of [[Zempei Matsumura]]'s book, ''Nikkō Tōshō-gū Shrine and Jingorō Hidari'' published by [[Nohi Publishing Company]] in 1975:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hidari Jingorō loved cats and was fascinated by cats. Jingorō spent eight months in seclusion to refine his knowledge and technique in wood sculpturing. He spent the majority of his time studying, sculpturing, and carving wooden cats that appeared lifelike in various shapes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Matsumura, it was Jingorō's goal to carve and sculpture lifelike cats by making "utmost efforts in the future to create a new style in the field of sculpturing". 

Prior to his seclusion, Jingorō was an apprentice for the Chief Architect [[Hokyo Yoheiji Yusa]] of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]] where he studied how to build temples, shrines, and sculptures. 

Through Jingorō's insight and new technique, animal sculpturing would take a new direction in Japan, a realistic appearance of an animal due to fine detailed sculpturing by the artist. Jingorō's approach in detailed wood sculpturing would later have an effect in other areas of Japanese art, namely, ceramic animals. 

This creative attention to detailing sculptured cats can be seen throughout the history of Japan, and more applicably in the ceramic arts. It is the fine detailed realistic life like cats that fascinates cat collectors, and makes these special type of cats highly desirable and collectible.

Matsumura also states, Nemuri Neko "Sleeping Cat symbolizes Nikkō or the Spirit of Ieyasu, who was thought to be the manifestation of [[Yakushi Nyorai]]", the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of Healing, who offers medicinal remedies, gives nourishment to the mind, body, and spirit, and comforts the sick and cures illnesses.

The nemuri neko is a National Treasure in Japan, and has been of inspiration to Japanese artists and artists around the world for centuries.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

The '''Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners''' (OHS) is a non-profit organization based in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] that helps individuals interested in the fiber crafts to communicate and develop their skills, including [[weaving]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[Dye|dying]], [[Basket weaving|basket makers]], [[braid]]ers, tablet weavers and paper makers. The OHS communicates to its members through a quarterly [[newsletter]], ''Fibre Focus'', provides [[educational]] programs in spinning and weaving, provides [[scholarships]] and organizes several seminars or conferences each year.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ohs.on.ca/ "Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners website"] OHS. Retrieved 28 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
On 8-9 April 1955 a meeting of 135 members of Ontario weaving guilds was held at the [[Heliconian Club]]. The noted New York weaver [[Berta Frey]] gave a talk and demonstrated putting on a multicolored warp. The group formed an advisory committee to look into setting up a provincial organization, leading to the foundation of the Ontario Handweavers and Spinners the next year.&lt;ref name=Norris1979&gt;{{Citation | last = Norris | first =  Compiled by J.A. | year = 1979|page=4ff

At the time there was increasing interest in reviving traditional [[craft]] skills.&lt;ref name=Alfoldy2005&gt;{{Citation  | last = Alfoldy | first =  Sandra | year = 2005 | title = Crafting Identity : the development of professional fine craft in Canada (p51) | isbn = 978-0-7735-2860-4 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986 the [[Handweavers Guild of America]] held ''Convergence '86'' in Toronto, Canada, its first biennial meeting outside the U.S. 
The conference was co-hosted by the [[Ontario Crafts Council]] and the Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners.
About 2,000 weavers and spinners attended the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=xvii |last=Crawford|first=Gail|title=A Fine Line: Studio Crafts in Ontario from 1930 to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4l6V1PBHhyUC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=2014-08-07|year=1998|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1998 the organization had grown to over 1,000 members, in over 70 [[guilds]] within six autonomous regions in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crawford | first =  Gail | year = 1998

The '''open-core model''' is a [[business model]] for the [[monetization]] of commercially-produced [[open-source software]]. Coined by Andrew Lampitt in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phipps|first1=Simon|title=Open Source Strategies for the Enterprise|date=July 2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-4117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the open-core model primarily involves offering a "core" or [[crippleware|feature-limited]] version of a software product as [[free and open-source software]], while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="Riehle"&gt;{{cite conference

==Controversy==
The concept of open-core software has proven to be controversial, as many developers do not consider the business model to be true open-source software. Despite this, open-core models are used by a large number of open-source software companies.&lt;ref name=li-opencore&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Core Debate: The Battle for a Business Model|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/66807.html|publisher=Linux Insider|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of contributor license agreements==
Some open-core products require their contributors to sign a [[contributor license agreement]], which either dictates that the copyright of all contributions to the product [[Work for hire|become the property of its owner]], or that the product's owner is given an unlimited, non-exclusive license to use the contributions, but the authors retain copyright ownership. In an open-core scenario, these agreements are typically meant to allow the commercial owner of the product (which in some cases, is ultimately the copyright holder to all of its code, regardless of its original author) to simultaneously market versions of the product under open-source and non-free licenses. This is in contrast with more traditional uses of CLAs, which are meant solely to allow the steward of an open-source project to defend its copyright, or guarantee that the code will only ever be made available under open-source terms, thus protecting it from becoming open core.&lt;ref name=infoworld-mysqlmistake&gt;{{cite web|title=MySQL mistake is a wake-up call on open source ownership|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078812/open-source-tools/mysql-mistake-is-a-wake-up-call-on-open-source-ownership.html|website=InfoWorld|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html | title = 6.1 Copyright Papers | accessdate = 2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victor Hugo.jpg|thumb|Photogravure of [[Victor Hugo]], 1883]]

'''Photogravure''' is an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printmaking]] or photo-mechanical process whereby a copper plate is grained (adding a pattern to the plate) and then coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue which had been exposed to a film positive, and then [[etching|etched]], resulting in a high quality [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plate that can reproduce detailed continuous tones of a photograph.

== History ==
[[File:W.E.F. Britten - Alfred, Lord Tennyson - St. Simeon Stylites.jpg|thumb|A 1901 photogravure illustration by [[William Edward Frank Britten|W. E. F. Britten]] for [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''St. Simeon Stylites''.]]

The earliest forms of photogravure were developed by two original pioneers of [[History of photography|photography]] itself, first [[Nicéphore Niépce]] in France in the 1820s, and later [[Henry Fox Talbot]] in England. Niépce was seeking a means to create photographic images on plates that could then be etched and used to make prints on paper with a traditional printing press. Niépce's early images were among the first [[photograph]]s, pre-dating [[daguerreotype]]s and the later wet collodion photographic process. Talbot, inventor of the [[calotype]] paper [[Negative (photography)|negative]] process, wanted to make paper prints that would not fade. He worked on his photomechanical process in the 1850s and patented it in 1852 ('photographic engraving') and 1858 ('photoglyphic engraving').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foxtalbot.dmu.ac.uk/talbot/biography.html#printersink |title=Talbot's Correspondence:Biography |publisher=De Montfort University |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photogravure in its mature form was developed in 1878 by Czech painter [[Karel Klíč]], who built on Talbot's research. This process, the one still in use today, is called the Talbot-Klič process.

Because of its high quality and richness, photogravure was used for both original [[fine art]] prints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photogravure.com/history/chapter_pictorialism.html|title=Pictorialism &amp; The Photo-Secession|publisher=Katzman, Mark|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and for photo-reproduction of works from other media such as paintings. Photogravure is distinguished from [[rotogravure]] in that photogravure uses a flat [[intaglio printing|copper plate]] etched rather deeply and printed by hand, while in rotogravure, as the name implies, a rotary cylinder is only lightly etched, and it is a factory printing process for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and packaging. In France the correct term for photogravure is ''héliogravure'', while the French term ''photogravure'' refers to any photo-based etching technique.

Photogravure registers a wide variety of tones, through the transfer of etching ink from an etched copper plate to special dampened paper run through an etching press. The unique tonal range comes from photogravure's variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which vary the size of dot, the depth of ink wells is varied in a photogravure plate. The human eye resolves these fine variations into a continuous tone image. Photogravure practitioners such as [[Peter Henry Emerson]] and others brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication [[Camera Work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photogravure.com/history/chapter_camerawork.html|title=Camera Notes &amp; Camera Work|publisher=Katzman, Mark|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication also featured the photogravures of [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] who was a fine gravure printer and envisioned his photographic work as gravures rather than other photo-based processes. The speed and convenience of silver-gelatin photography eventually displaced photogravure which fell into disuse after the [[Edward S. Curtis]] gravures in the 1920s. One of the last major portfolios of fine art photogravures was [[Paul Strand]]'s ''Photographs from Mexico'' from 1940, reissued as ''The Mexican Portfolio'' in 1967 by DeCapo Press. Many years later, photogravure has experienced a revival in the hands of Aperture and Jon Goodman, who studied it in Europe. Photogravure is now actively practiced in several dozen workshops around the world.

== Technique ==

Photogravure plates go through several distinct stages:

* First, a [[continuous tone]] film positive is made from the original photographic negative. A smaller negative can be enlarged onto a sheet of film, which is then processed to a range of continuous tones with specific densities.
* The second stage is to sensitize a sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue by immersion into a 3.5% solution of [[potassium dichromate]] for 3 minutes. Once dried against an [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] (Plexiglas, Perspex) surface, it is ready for the next stage.
* The third stage (usually the next day) is to expose the film positive to the sensitized gravure tissue. The positive is placed on top of the sensitized sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue. The sandwich is then exposed to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. A separate exposure to a very fine stochastic or hard-dot [[mezzotint]] screen is made, or alternatively an [[aquatint]] grain of [[asphaltum]] or rosin is applied and fused to the copperplate usually before the exposed gelatin tissue is adhered to the plate. The UV light travels through the positive and screen (if used) in succession, each time hardening the gelatin in proportion to the degree of light exposed to it.
* The fourth stage is to adhere the exposed tissue to the copper plate. The gelatin tissue is adhered or "laid down" onto the highly polished copper plate under a layer of cool water. It is squeezed into place and the excess water is wiped clear.
* Once adhered, the fifth stage is to use a hot water bath to remove the paper backing and to wash away the softer, unexposed gelatin. The remaining depth of hardened gelatin is relative to the exposure. This layer of hardened gelatin forms a contoured resist on the copper plate. The resist is dried, and the edges and back of the copper are stopped out (staged).
* The sixth stage is to etch the plate in a series of [[ferric chloride]] baths, from the densest to slightly more dilute, in steps. The density of these baths is measured in degrees [[Baumé scale|Baumé]]. The ferric chloride migrates through the gelatin, etching the shadows and blacks under the thinnest areas first. The etching progresses through the tonal scale from dark to light as the plate is moved to successively more dilute baths of ferric chloride. The image is etched onto the copperplate by the ferric chloride, creating a gravure plate with tiny "wells" of varying depth to hold ink. The pattern formed by the aquatint grain or the screen exposure creates minute "lands" around which the etching occurs, giving the copperplate the ''tooth'' to hold ink. The "wells" which hold the ink vary in depth, a unique aspect of photogravure.
* The final stage is to print the cleaned plate.

[[File:Photogravure steps.jpg|frame|center|A series of illustrations representing the steps of the photogravure process]]

=== Printing the plate ===

Printing a photogravure is similar to printing any other [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plate, especially a finely etched [[aquatint]]. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink is applied to the whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.

Macdermid Autotype, the last manufacturer of the gelatin pigment paper (tissue) needed to make traditional copper plate photogravure, announced the end of their production in August 2009. Since then, other manufacturers, including Bostick &amp; Sullivan, Phoenix Gravure, and others in India, Taiwan, and Japan have begun supplying gelatin pigment paper (resist tissue) to the market. These products are used by practitioners of traditional photogravure etching and by commercial printers.

== Alternatives ==

=== Digital direct-to-plate photogravure ===

Donald Farnsworth at the art workshop [[Magnolia Editions]] developed a digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin.  Instead, a series of 'masks' (layers of resist) are printed onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: “The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic [random] dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you’re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that’s etched are the light tones.”&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/PressRelease/Gravure_Article.pdf "Direct to Plate Photogravure: Catching Up With the Past."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020910/http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/PressRelease/Gravure_Article.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }} Stone, Nick. Retrieved 2009-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the light values be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the lighter values to protect them from subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.

In another variation of the traditional process, where the acid baths are increasingly watered down as the process unfolds, the direct-to-plate process begins with a weak bath and is gradually etched in baths which are increasingly acidic.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Photo-polymergravure / Polymer photogravure ===

Photopolymer plates, usually used for relief and letterpress printing, can be used to make photogravure plates.  These [[polymer]] plates, when developed, are a hard plastic, which allows for fewer impressions to be made. Some feel that they rival the quality of traditional copper plate photogravure, while others find that the lack of differential depth in the polymer coating compromises quality.

The process involves a series of exposures of the polymer plate. First, it is exposed under strong light with a random dot screen placed on top of it (called an aquatint screen in fine art printing or a stochastic screen in commercial printing). Next, the plate is exposed to a positive transparency of an image. This transparency can be a continuous tone positive on film, but is most often made as a digital 'positive' (made in the same way as a [[Digital negative (transparency)|digital negative]]) printed with an inkjet printer. The plate is then developed; for most types and brands of plates, this is done in water.

After proper drying and curing, the plate can be inked and printed. The dual exposures produce an "etched" polymer plate with many thousands of indentations of varying depth which hold ink, which in turn are transferred as a continuous tone image to a sheet of paper. Depending on the quality, the resulting print may look similar to or the same as those produced with the traditional photogravure process, though without the same amount of three-dimensional depth on the surface of the plate, and arguably, the print itself.

Two polymer plates commonly in use are Printight plates made by the [[Toyobo]] Corporation and Solarplates.

'''Provincial Domain Dommelhof''' is an institution of the province [[Limburg (Belgium)]] in Belgium for culture, performing arts, and sports. Dommelhof was opened in 1967 in the municipality [[Neerpelt]]. The institution was the first cultural center in Flanders.

== History ==
In 1962, the [[Provincial council (Belgium)|Provincial Council]] of Belgian Limburg decided to set up Dommelhof. Second [[Minister of Culture]] [[Frans Van Mechelen]] decided to subsidize the construction of the cultural infrastructure. This infrastructure, designed by [[Alfons Hoppenbrouwers]], included a theater, education and residence building. In 1967 the first show of the theater was a fact. Until the 1980s, content was mainly devoted to [[social-cultural education]] and experimental programming in the theater. In 1979 the site was expanded with a sports center.
In the 1980s an international doll festival was launched and a summer festival for open air theater was launched. The puppet festival has disappeared and the festival for open air theater expanded in the following years to the international festival for outdoor, venue and circus theater on the Market. The platform for arthousecinema in Limburg, [[Zebracinema]], also originated in Dommelhof.

The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof is the biggest [[sound art]] collection in a public space in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others.

== Operation ==
The current activities of Dommelhof include:
* Theater op de Markt: Distribution and creation of circus and open-air theater through a summer festival and autumn festival, and a production cell for (inter)national creation assignments and residences&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenda.hbvl.be/agenda/a/theater-op-de-markt-provinciaal-domein-dommelhof/BF79E4C1-A052-7176-CAE2BF19A5DF0490 Article about Theater op de Markt] in [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* TAKT: support talent in performing arts
* Sports center: facilitating regional sports activities&lt;ref&gt;https://dommelhofsport.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/dommelhof-wordt-g-sportcentrum/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Residence building: facilitating multi-day training for the socio-cultural field

== Partners ==
Dommelhof works structurally with regional and Flemish cultural partners:
* Musica: Impulse Center for music, and manager of [[het Klankenbos]] (the sound forest) on the Dommelhof site
* Zebracinema: arthouse cinema in Belgian Limburg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/gec816v0 Article about Zebracinema] in [[De Standaard]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychogeography''' is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting".  It has links to the [[Situationist International]].  Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by [[Guy Debord]] as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2 Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life". Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes [[pedestrians]] off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new [[awareness]] of the urban landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joseph (July/August 2004).

Psychogeography was originally developed by the avant-garde movement [[Lettrist International]] in the journal ''Potlatch''.  The originator of what became known as [[unitary urbanism]], psychogeography, and the [[dérive]] was [[Ivan Chtcheglov]], in his highly influential 1953 essay "Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau" ("Formulary for a New Urbanism").&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"]. Full text at bopsecrets.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lettrists' reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].  The idea of urban wandering relates to the older concept of the [[flâneur]], theorized by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  Following Chtcheglov's exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, [[Guy Debord]] and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.  At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, [[Italy]] in 1956, the Lettrists joined the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] to set a proper definition for the idea announced by [[Gil J. Wolman]]: "Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, Gil (1956). ''Address by the Lettrist International Delegate to the Alba Conference of September 1956'' ALba: Lettrist International.&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded the rejection of functional, [[Euclid]]ean values in [[architecture]], as well as the separation between art and its surroundings.  The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified.  This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one's ability to identify where "function" ends and "play" (the "ludic") begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and [[Situationist International]] believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- These last few sentences need referencing. Who is making these arguments? --&gt;

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan (1953). [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: "[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones".{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}

The Situationists' response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression.  Their intentions remained completely as abstractions.  Guy Debord's truest intention was to unify two different factors of "ambiance" that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions.  Debord's vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard.  The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

However, the Situationist International may have been [[tongue-in-cheek]] about some parts of psychogeography.  "This apparently serious term 'psychogeography'", writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, "comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both."{{Sfn|Kaufman|2006|p=114}}

Eventually, Debord and [[Asger Jorn]] resigned themselves to the fate of "urban relativity".  Debord readily admits in his 1961 film ''A Critique of Separation'', "The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents".  Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, "none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Separation'' (1961). Complete Cinematic Works ([[AK Press]], 2003, Trans. Knabb. K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, ''On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time'' (1959), the title of which suggests its own subject matter.  The film's narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves.  Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
{{cquote
|When freedom is practised in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
{{cquote
|The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Quoting [[Karl Marx]], Debord says:
{{cquote
|People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

While a reading of the texts included in the journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise.  While Debord's influence in bringing Chtchglov's text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the 'praxis' of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all of the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary's directives.  Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation.  The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques.  Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible.  As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the 'beautiful language' of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==
{{Main|Dérive}}
Psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies.  Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").

{{cquote
|In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}
}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops — the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, ed. (1998). ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel Pub.. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".{{Sfn|McDonough|2004|p=259}}  To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.  The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the {{clarify|text=situationist city|date=August 2016}}.

==Contemporary psychogeography==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] serves as the focal point of local psychogeography oriented groups]]Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, [[avant-garde]], [[neoist]], and [[revolutionary]] groups emerged, developing psychogeographical [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in various ways.  Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] and the foundation of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]], these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychogeography.org |title=psychogeography.org weblog and archive |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both [[Glasgow]] and London.  The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group's journal ''Viscosity'', expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of [[urban design]] and architectural performance.

The journal ''[[Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration]]'' (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes.  The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps&lt;ref&gt;"The production of psychogeographical maps, or even the introduction of alterations such as more or less arbitrarily transposing maps of two different regions, can contribute to clarifying certain wanderings that express not subordination to randomness but total insubordination to habitual influences (influences generally categorized as tourism, that popular drug as repugnant as sports or buying on credit)." from ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'', Debord 55&lt;/ref&gt; which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as [[Provflux]] and [[Psy-Geo-conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography.

Psychogeography also become a device used in [[performance art]] and [[literature]].  In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]] and the documentaries of filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]].  The popularity of Sinclair drew the term into greater public use in the United Kingdom.  Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape.  Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers like [[William Blake]], [[Arthur Machen]], and [[Thomas de Quincey]].  The nature and history of [[London]] were a central focus of these writers, utilising [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[gothic novel|gothic]], and [[occult]] ideas to describe and transform the city.  Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in such key texts as ''Lights Out for the Territory''.  Peter Ackroyd's bestselling ''London: A Biography'' was partially based on similar sources.  [[Merlin Coverley]] gives equal prominence to this literary tradition alongside Situationism in his 2006 book ''Psychogeography'', not only recognising that the situationist origins of psychogeography are sometimes forgotten, but that via certain writers like [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daniel Defoe]], and Charles Baudelaire, they had a shared tradition. Novelist [[Will Self]] had a column "Psychogeography" which started out in the [[British Airways]] [[Inflight magazine]] and then appeared weekly in the Saturday magazine of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper until October 2008.

The concepts and themes seen in popular comics writers such as [[Alan Moore]] in works like ''[[From Hell]]'' are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography.  Other key figures in this version of the idea are [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].  Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from [[Charles Fort|Fort]]ean and occult areas like [[earth mysteries]], [[ley lines]], and [[chaos magic]], a course pioneered by Sinclair.  A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

After a few years of practicing, the psychogeography group that gravitates around the Urban Squares Initiative and Aleksandar Janicijevic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/07author.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033354/http://urbansquares.com/07author.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330183148/http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiator of, and main figure in organizing and leading this group, came up with the working definition of this procedure as: "The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances". In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published "Urbis - Language of the urban fabric" as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published "MyPsychogeography", an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |title=psychogeography now – window to the urban future &amp;#124; …… |publisher=Photoblog.urbansquares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606150623/http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate making dérives, a number of applications for mobile devices have been created over the last few years.  Most notably, Dérive app,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deriveapp.com/ Dérive app]&lt;/ref&gt; Serendipitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serendipitor.net/ Serendipitor]&lt;/ref&gt; Drift,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokencitylab.org/drift/ Drift]&lt;/ref&gt; and Random GPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogovoyages.com/random_gps.html Random GPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MorganLeafVerso.jpg|thumb|The "Morgan Leaf", detached from the [[Winchester Bible]] of 1160−75. Scenes from the life of [[David]].]] 

'''Romanesque art''' is the art of Europe from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the [[Gothic Art|Gothic style]] in the 12th century, or later, depending on region. The preceding period is known as the [[Pre-Romanesque]] period. The term was invented by 19th-century art historians, especially for [[Romanesque architecture]], which retained many basic features of [[Roman architecture|Roman architectural style]] – most notably round-headed arches, but also [[barrel vault]]s, [[apse]]s, and [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf decoration – but had also developed many very different characteristics.  In Southern France, Spain and Italy there was an architectural continuity with the Late Antique, but the Romanesque style was the first style to spread across the whole of Catholic Europe, from Sicily to Scandinavia.  Romanesque art was also greatly influenced by [[Byzantine art]], especially in painting, and by the anti-classical energy of the decoration of the [[Insular art]] of the [[British Isles]]. From these elements was forged a highly innovative and coherent style.

==Characteristics==
Outside Romanesque architecture, the art of the period was characterised by a vigorous style in both sculpture and painting.  The latter continued to follow essentially [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[iconography|iconographic]] models for the most common subjects in churches, which remained [[Christ in Majesty]], the [[Last Judgement]] and scenes from the [[Life of Christ]]. In [[illuminated manuscript]]s more originality is seen, as new scenes needed to be depicted. The most lavishly decorated manuscripts of this period were bibles and [[psalters]]. The same originality applied to the capitals of columns: often carved with complete scenes with several figures. The large wooden [[crucifix]] was a German innovation at the very start of the period, as were free-standing statues of the enthroned Madonna. [[High relief]] was the dominant sculptural mode of the period.   
[[File:'The Virgin and Child in Majesty and the Adoration of the Maji', Romanesque fresco by the Master of Pedret from the apse of the Church of Saint Joan at Tredos, Lleida, Spain, c. 1100.jpg|thumb|right|[[Master of Pedret]], ''The Virgin and Child in Majesty and the Adoration of the Magi,'' [[apse]] [[fresco]] from Tredòs, [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], c. 1100, now at [[The Cloisters]] in [[New York City]].]]

Colours were very striking, and mostly primary. In the 21st century: these colours can only be seen in their original brightness in stained glass, and a few well preserved manuscripts. [[Stained glass]] became widely used, although survivals are sadly few.  In an invention of the period, the tympanums of important church portals were carved with monumental schemes, often ''Christ in Majesty'' or the ''Last Judgement'', but treated with more freedom than painted versions, as there were no equivalent Byzantine models.

Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to be squeezed into the shapes of [[historiated initial]]s, column capitals, and church tympanums; the tension between a tightly enclosing frame, from which the composition sometimes escapes, is a recurrent theme in Romanesque art. Figures often varied in size in relation to their importance. Landscape backgrounds, if attempted at all, were closer to abstract decorations than realism – as in the trees in the "Morgan Leaf".  Portraiture hardly existed.

==Background==
During this period Europe grew steadily more prosperous, and art of the highest quality was no longer confined, as it largely was in the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] periods, to the royal court and a small circle of monasteries.  Monasteries continued to be extremely important, especially those of the expansionist new orders of the period, the [[Cistercian]], [[Cluniac]], and [[Carthusian]], which spread across Europe. But city churches, those on pilgrimage routes, and many churches in small towns and villages were elaborately decorated to a very high standard – these are often the structures to have survived, when cathedrals and city churches have been rebuilt. No Romanesque royal palace has really survived.

The lay artist was becoming a valued figure – [[Nicholas of Verdun]] seems to have been known across the continent. Most masons and [[goldsmith]]s were now lay, and lay painters such as [[Master Hugo]] seem to have been in the majority, at least of those doing the best work, by the end of the period. The [[iconography]] of their church work was no doubt arrived at in consultation with clerical advisors.

==Sculpture==

===Metalwork, enamels, and ivories===
[[File:Stavelot.Triptych.jpg|right|left|thumb|[[Stavelot Triptych]], [[Mosan art|Mosan]], Belgium, c. 1156–1158. {{nowrap|48 × 66 cm}} with wings open, [[Morgan Library]], New York]]

Precious objects in these media had a very high status in the period, probably much more so than paintings – the names of more makers of these objects are known than those of contemporary painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], became very sophisticated. Many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Nicholas of Verdun]] and others (c. 1180–1225). The [[Stavelot Triptych]] and [[Reliquary of St. Maurus]] are other examples of [[Mosan art|Mosan]] enamelwork. Large reliquaries and altar [[Antependium|frontal]]s were built around a wooden frame, but smaller caskets were all metal and enamel. A few secular pieces, such as mirror cases, jewellery and clasps have survived, but these no doubt under-represent the amount of fine metalwork owned by the nobility.

[[File:Gloucester candlestick.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gloucester candlestick]], early 12th century]]

The bronze [[Gloucester candlestick]] and the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|brass font of 1108–1117 now in Liège]] are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting. The former is highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]], the [[Gniezno Doors]], and the doors of the [[Basilica di San Zeno]] in [[Verona]] are other substantial survivals. The [[aquamanile]], a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century. Artisans often gave the pieces fantastic [[zoomorphic]] forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.

The [[Cloisters Cross]] is an unusually large [[ivory]] crucifix, with complex carving including many figures of [[prophet]]s and others, which has been attributed to one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, [[Master Hugo]], who also illuminated manuscripts. Like many pieces it was originally partly coloured.  The [[Lewis chessmen]] are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which many pieces or fragments remain from [[crozier]]s, plaques, [[pectoral cross]]es and similar objects.

===Architectural sculpture===
[[File:02 Basilique Ste-Marie-Madeleine de Vézelay - Tympan.jpg|thumb|280px|The tympanum of [[Vézelay Abbey]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[France]], 1130s, has much decorative spiral detail in the draperies.]]

With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the tradition of carving large works in stone and sculpting figures in bronze died out, as it effectively did (for religious reasons) in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) world. Some life-size sculpture was evidently done in [[stucco]] or plaster, but surviving examples are understandably rare.&lt;ref&gt;Some (probably) 9th century near life-size stucco figures were discovered behind a wall in Santa Maria in Valle, [[Cividale del Friuli]] in Northern Italy relatively recently. Atroshenko and Collins p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known surviving large sculptural work of Proto-Romanesque Europe is the [[Gero Crucifix|life-size wooden Crucifix commissioned by Archbishop Gero of Cologne]] in about 960–965, apparently the prototype of what became a popular form. These were later set up on a beam below the [[chancel]] arch, known in English as a [[rood]], from the twelfth century accompanied by figures of the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]] to the sides.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 140–142 for early crosses, p. 145 for roods, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 11th and 12th centuries, figurative sculpture strongly revived, and architectural [[relief]]s are a hallmark of the later Romanesque period.

====Sources and style====
Figurative sculpture was based on two other sources in particular, manuscript illumination and small-scale sculpture in ivory and metal. The extensive friezes sculpted on [[Armenia]]n and Syriac churches have been proposed as another likely influence.&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'', p. 144–150, Lund Humphries, London, 1985, {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources together produced a distinct style which can be recognised across Europe, although the most spectacular sculptural projects are concentrated in South-Western France, Northern Spain and Italy.

[[File:Cathédrale de Cahors 159714.jpg|thumb|left|Man and confronted animals, [[Cahors Cathedral]]]]
Images that occurred in metalwork were frequently embossed. The resultant surface had two main planes and details that were usually incised. This treatment was adapted to stone carving and is seen particularly in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the portal, where the imagery of [[Christ in Majesty]] with the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]] is drawn directly from the gilt covers of medieval [[Gospel Book]]s. This style of doorway occurs in many places and continued into the Gothic period. A rare survival in England is that of the "Prior's Door" at [[Ely Cathedral]]. In South-Western France, many have survived, with impressive examples at Saint-Pierre, [[Moissac]], [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Howe
  | first =Jeffery   | title =Romanesque Architecture (slides)   | work =A digital archive of architecture    | publisher =[[Boston College]]  | url =http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/arch/souillac.html   | accessdate =2007-09-28  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madeleine, Vézelay]] – all daughter houses of Cluny, with extensive other sculpture remaining in cloisters and other buildings. Nearby, [[Autun Cathedral]] has a [[Last Judgement]] of great rarity in that it has uniquely been signed by its creator, [[Giselbertus]].&lt;ref name=HG&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RH&gt;Rene Hyughe, ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Byzantine and Medieval Art&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A feature of the figures in manuscript illumination is that they often occupy confined spaces and are contorted to fit. The custom of artists to make the figure fit the available space lent itself to a facility in designing figures to ornament door posts and lintels and other such architectural surfaces. The robes of painted figures were commonly treated in a flat and decorative style that bore little resemblance to the weight and fall of actual cloth. This feature was also adapted for sculpture. Among the many examples that exist, one of the finest is the figure of the [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Prophet Jeremiah]] from the pillar of the portal of the [[Moissac Abbey|Abbey of Saint-Pierre]], [[Moissac]], France, from about 1130.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

One of the most significant motifs of Romanesque design, occurring in both figurative and non-figurative sculpture is the spiral. One of the sources may be [[Ionic order|Ionic capitals]]. Scrolling vines were a common motif of both Byzantine and Roman design, and may be seen in mosaic on the vaults of the 4th century Church of [[Santa Costanza]], Rome. Manuscripts and architectural carvings of the 12th century have very similar scrolling vine motifs.

[[File:ND-en-Vaux Chapiteau 4.jpg|thumb|This capital of [[Foot washing|Christ washing the feet of his Apostles]] has strong narrative qualities in the interaction of the figures.]] 
Another source of the spiral is clearly the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the 7th to 9th centuries, particularly [[Insular art|Irish manuscripts]] such as the [[St. Gall Gospel Book]], spread into Europe by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]. In these illuminations the use of the spiral has nothing to do with vines or other plant forms. The motif is abstract and mathematical.  The style was then picked up in [[Carolingian art]] and given a more botanical character. It is in an adaptation of this form that the spiral occurs in the draperies of both sculpture and [[stained glass]] windows. Of all the many examples that occur on Romanesque portals, one of the most outstanding is that of the central figure of Christ at [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madeleine, Vezelay]].&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

Another influence from [[Insular art]] are engaged and entwined animals, often used to superb effect in capitals (as at Silos) and sometimes on a column itself (as at Moissac). Much of the treatment of paired, confronted and entwined animals in Romanesque decoration has similar Insular origins, as do animals whose bodies tail into purely decorative shapes.  (Despite the adoption of Hiberno-Saxon traditions into Romanesque styles in England and on the continent, the influence was primarily one-way. Irish art during this period remained isolated, developing a unique amalgam of native Irish and [[Viking]] styles which would be slowly extinguished and replaced by mainstream Romanesque style in the early 13th century following the [[Norman Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion]] of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Stalley, "Irish Art in the Romanesque and Gothic Periods".  In ''Treasures of Irish Art 1500 B.C. to 1500 A.D.'', New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art/Alfred A. Knopf, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Autun Cathedrale Chapiteau pendaison de Judas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judas Iscariot]] hangs himself, assisted by devils, always a favourite subject of carvers. [[Autun Cathedral]]]]

====Subject matter====
Most Romanesque sculpture is pictorial and biblical in subject. A great variety of themes are found on capitals and include scenes of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]], episodes from the life of Christ and those [[Old Testament]] scenes which [[Typology (theology)|prefigure]] his [[Crucifixion of Christ|Death]] and [[Resurrection]], such as [[Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]] and [[Daniel in the lions' den]]. Many [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scenes occur, the theme of the [[Adoration of the Magi|Three Kings]] being particularly popular. The cloisters of [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] in Northern Spain, and [[Moissac]] are fine examples surviving complete, as are the relief sculptures on the many [[Tournai font]]s found in churches in southern England, France and Belgium.

A feature of some Romanesque churches is the extensive sculptural scheme which covers the area surrounding the portal or, in some case, much of the facade. [[Angouleme Cathedral]] in France has a highly elaborate scheme of sculpture set within the broad niches created by the arcading of the facade. In the Spanish region of Catalonia, an elaborate pictorial scheme in low relief surrounds the door of the church of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll|Santa Maria at Ripoll]].&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

[[File:Modillonsarthous2.JPG|thumb|Around the upper wall of the chancel at the Abbaye d'Arthous, [[Landes (department)|Landes]], France, are small figures depicting lust, intemperance and a Barbary ape, symbol of human depravity.]]
The purpose of the sculptural schemes was to convey a message that the Christian believer should recognize wrongdoing, repent and be redeemed. The [[Last Judgement]] reminds the believer to repent. The carved or painted [[Crucifix]], displayed prominently within the church, reminds the sinner of redemption.

[[File:Kilpeck Details of Door Arch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ouroboros]], single and in pairs at [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|Kilpeck]], England]]
Often the sculpture is alarming in form and in subject matter. These works are found on capitals, corbels and bosses, or entwined in the foliage on door mouldings. They represent forms that are not easily recognizable today. Common motifs include [[Sheela na Gig]], fearsome [[demons]], [[ouroboros]] or dragons swallowing their tails, and many other [[mythology|myth]]ical creatures with obscure meaning. Spirals and paired motifs originally had special significance in [[oral tradition]] that has been lost or rejected by modern scholars.

The [[Seven Deadly Sins]] including lust, gluttony and avarice are also frequently represented. The appearance of many figures with oversized genitals can be equated with carnal sin, and so can the numerous figures shown with protruding tongues, which are a feature of the doorway of [[Lincoln Cathedral]]. Pulling one's beard was a symbol of masturbation, and pulling one's mouth wide open was also a sign of lewdness. A common theme found on capitals of this period is a tongue poker or beard stroker being beaten by his wife or seized by demons. Demons fighting over the soul of a wrongdoer such as a miser is another popular subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Satan in the Groin  | publisher =beyond-the-pale  | url =http://www.beyond-the-pale.org.uk/satan1.htm  | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santiago Catedral Pórtico da gloria GDFL6.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Pórtico da Gloria, [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela|Santiago Cathedral]]. The colouring once common to much Romanesque sculpture has been preserved.]]

====Late Romanesque sculpture====
[[Gothic architecture]] is usually considered to begin with the design of the choir at the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], north of Paris, by the [[Abbot Suger]], consecrated 1144. The beginning of Gothic sculpture is usually dated a little later, with the carving of the figures around the Royal Portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]], France, 1150–1155. The style of sculpture spread rapidly from Chartres, overtaking the new Gothic architecture. In fact, many churches of the late Romanesque period post-date the building at Saint-Denis. The sculptural style based more upon observation and naturalism than on formalised design developed rapidly. It is thought that one reason for the rapid development of naturalistic form was a growing awareness of Classical remains in places where they were most numerous and a deliberate imitation of their style. The consequence is that there are doorways which are Romanesque in form, and yet show a naturalism associated with Early Gothic sculpture.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

One of these is the ''Pórtico da Gloria'' dating from 1180, at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. This portal is internal and is particularly well preserved, even retaining colour on the figures and indicating the gaudy appearance of much architectural decoration which is now perceived as monochrome. Around the doorway are figures who are integrated with the colonnettes that make the mouldings of the doors. They are three-dimensional, but slightly flattened. They are highly individualised, not only in appearance but also expression and bear quite strong resemblance to those around the north porch of the Abbey of St. Denis, dating from 1170. Beneath the tympanum there is a realistically carved row of figures playing a range of different and easily identifiable musical instruments.

===Manuscript illumination===

A number of regional schools converged in the early Romanesque [[illuminated manuscript]]: the "Channel school" of England and Northern France was heavily influenced by late [[Anglo-Saxon art]], whereas in Southern France the style depended more on Iberian influence, and in Germany and the [[Low Countries]], [[Ottonian art|Ottonian styles]] continued to develop, and also, along with Byzantine styles, influenced Italy.  By the 12th century there had been reciprocal influences between all these, although naturally regional distinctiveness remained.

The typical ''focii'' of Romanesque illumination were the Bible, where each book could be prefaced by a large [[historiated initial]], and the [[Psalter]], where major initials were similarly illuminated.  In both cases more lavish examples might have cycles of scenes in fully illuminated pages, sometimes with several scenes per page, in compartments.  The Bibles in particular often had a, and might be bound into more than one volume.  Examples include the [[St. Albans Psalter]], [[Hunterian Psalter]], [[Winchester Bible]] (the "Morgan Leaf" shown above), [[Fécamp Bible]], [[Stavelot Bible]], and [[Parc Abbey Bible]].  By the end of the period lay commercial workshops of artists and scribes were becoming significant, and illumination, and books generally, became more widely available to both laity and clergy.

===Wall painting===
[[File:Novalesa_Sant_Eldrado-2.jpg|thumb|left|Life of St. Eldrado, abbot. 11th century fresco in [[Novalesa Abbey]]]]

[[File:Meister aus Tahull 001.jpg|thumb|[[Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] fresco by the [[Master of Taüll]], now in [[National Art Museum of Catalonia|Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].]]
The large wall surfaces and plain, curving vaults of the Romanesque period lent themselves to mural decoration. Unfortunately, many of these early wall paintings have been destroyed by damp or the walls have been replastered and painted over. In England, France and the Netherlands such pictures were systematically destroyed or whitewashed in bouts of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]].  [[Church frescos in Denmark|In Denmark]] and elsewhere many have since been restored. In [[Catalonia (Spain)]], there was a campaign to save such murals in the early 20th century (as of 1907) by removing them and transferring them to safekeeping in [[Barcelona]], resulting in the spectacular collection at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]. In other countries they have suffered from war, neglect and changing fashion.

A classic scheme for the full painted decoration of a church, derived from earlier examples often in [[mosaic]], had, as its focal point in the [[semi-dome]] of the apse, [[Christ in Majesty]] or Christ the Redeemer enthroned within a [[mandorla]] and framed by the four winged beasts, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], comparing directly with examples from the gilt covers or the illuminations of [[Gospel Book]]s of the period.  If the [[Virgin Mary]] was the dedicatee of the church, she might replace Christ here. On the apse walls below would be saints and apostles, perhaps including narrative scenes, for example of the saint to whom the church was dedicated.  On the sanctuary arch were figures of apostles, prophets or the twenty-four "[[Heavenly host|elders of the Apocalypse]]", looking in towards a bust of Christ, or his symbol the Lamb, at the top of the arch.  The north wall of the nave would contain narrative scenes from the Old Testament, and the south wall from the New Testament.  On the rear west wall would be a [[Last Judgement]], with an enthroned and judging Christ at the top.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p154, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon (San Isidoro, panteón).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The painted crypt of [[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] at [[León, Spain]]]]

One of the most intact schemes to exist is that at [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] in France. The long barrel vault of the nave provides an excellent surface for fresco, and is decorated with scenes of the [[Old Testament]], showing the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]], the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]] and other stories including a lively depiction of [[Noah's Ark]] complete with a fearsome figurehead and numerous windows through with can be seen the Noah and his family on the upper deck, birds on the middle deck, while on the lower are the pairs of animals. Another scene shows with great vigour the swamping of Pharaoh's army by the [[Red Sea]]. The scheme extends to other parts of the church, with the martyrdom of the local saints shown in the crypt, and [[Apocalypse]] in the narthex and [[Christ in Majesty]]. The range of colours employed is limited to light blue-green, yellow ochre, reddish brown and black. Similar paintings exist in [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and elsewhere in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Toman, Romanesque, Könemann, (1997), {{ISBN|3-89508-447-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now-dispersed [[paintings from Arlanza]] in the [[Province of Burgos]], [[Spain]], though from a monastery, are secular in subject-matter, showing huge and vigorous mythical beasts above a frieze in black and white with other creatures.  They give a rare idea of what decorated Romanesque palaces would have contained.

==Other visual arts==

===Embroidery===
Romanesque embroidery is best known from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], but many more closely worked pieces of [[Opus Anglicanum]] ("English work" – considered the finest in the West) and other styles have survived, mostly as church [[vestment]]s.

===Stained glass===
The oldest-known fragments of medieval pictorial stained glass appear to date from the 10th century. The earliest intact figures are five prophet windows at Augsburg, dating from the late 11th century. The figures, though stiff and formalised, demonstrate considerable proficiency in design, both pictorially and in the functional use of the glass, indicating that their maker was well accustomed to the medium. At [[Le Mans Cathedral|Le Mans]], Canterbury and Chartres Cathedrals, and [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], a number of panels of the 12th century have survived. At Canterbury these include a figure of Adam digging, and another of his son Seth from a series of [[Ancestors of Christ]]. Adam represents a highly naturalistic and lively portrayal, while in the figure of Seth, the robes have been used to great decorative effect, similar to the best stone carving of the period. Glass craftsmen were slower than architects to change their style, and much glass from at least the first part of the 13th century can be considered as essentially Romanesque. Especially fine are large figures of 1200 from [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (some now removed to the museum) and of about 1220 from Saint Kunibert's Church in [[Cologne]].

Most of the magnificent stained glass of France, including the famous windows of Chartres, date from the 13th century. Far fewer large windows remain intact from the 12th century. One such is the Crucifixion of Poitiers, a remarkable composition which rises through three stages, the lowest with a quatrefoil depicting the Martyrdom of St Peter, the largest central stage dominated by the crucifixion and the upper stage showing the [[Ascension of Christ]] in a mandorla. The figure of the crucified Christ is already showing the Gothic curve. The window is described by George Seddon as being of "unforgettable beauty".&lt;ref&gt;George Seddon in Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;  Many detached fragments are in museums, and a window at [[Twycross]] Church in England is made up of important French panels rescued from the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheepychurches.org.uk/twycross.htm Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708091556/http://www.sheepychurches.org.uk/twycross.htm |date=2008-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glass was both expensive and fairly flexible (in that it could be added to or re-arranged) and seems to have been often re-used when churches were rebuilt in the Gothic style – the earliest datable English glass, a panel in [[York Minster]] from a [[Tree of Jesse]] probably of before 1154, has been recycled in this way.

[[File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Edwin Landseer]], ''Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom'', 1851, [[National Gallery of Victoria]].]]

'''''Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom''''' is an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by British artist [[Edwin Landseer]].  Landseer was mainly known for his paintings of animals: this is his only painting of a fairy scene.  The painting depicts a scene from the third act of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.  It has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]] since 1932.

The painting shows [[Titania]], Queen of the Fairies, after she has been given a love potion, embracing the temporary object of her love, the mechanical [[Nick Bottom]].  Bottom has been also enchanted and has the head of an [[Asinus|ass]].  They are observed by other fairy folk, and the scene is decorated with flowers and rabbits.

The work measures {{convert|82.0|xx|133.0|cm}}.  It was one of several paintings of scenes from works by Shakespeare commissioned by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] in 1847 to decorate the dining room of his house in London.  Landseer was paid £450.  Brunel left the choice of subject to the artists, and Landseer may have chosen this scene so he could include several animals. Other works were commissioned from [[Charles West Cope]], [[Augustus Egg]], [[Frederick Richard Lee]], [[Charles Robert Leslie]], and [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield]].

The painting was first exhibited the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1851, and was immediately a popular success.  It was praised by [[Queen Victoria]] in her diary, and by [[Lewis Carroll]], who admired the [[white rabbit]]; the work may have influenced the white rabbit in his book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

After Brunel's death in 1859, the painting was sold at auction in April 1860 and acquired by [[Lord Robert Pelham-Clinton]] for £2,800.  After the death of Pelham-Clinton, it was acquired by [[Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow]], and later sold to [[Sir William Quilter, 1st Baronet]].  It was then sold to [[Henry Lowenfeld]] at [[Christie's]] in 1909 for £2,400 (the auction also included [[Holman Hunt]]'s ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'').  After Lowenfeld's death in 1931, his widow sold the painting to the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (funded from the [[Felton Bequest]]) where it remains today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10819">[[Aaron Copland]] wrote the '''Symphony for Organ and Orchestra''' in 1924.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; It represents a major work in the composer's [[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]], as it was his first fully realized orchestral work, his first work for organ, and the first piece whose [[orchestration]] he heard. In 1928, Copland re-orchestrated the work without organ as his '''Symphony No. 1''', rewriting the organ part in the brass and adding saxophone.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

==History==
Copland studied [[Musical composition#Composing music|composition]] in Paris from 1921 to 1924 under famed pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]]. He was especially appreciative of the confidence she displayed in her young American students, and she arranged for him to write a major symphonic work for organ and orchestra to be premiered by herself on organ and the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Walter Damrosch]] followed by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] (BSO) under [[Serge Koussevitzky]]. He had come to be known around Paris as "that talented young American composer," and at a meeting at Koussevitzky's house with [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and Boulanger, the conductor remarked "''You'' vill [sic] write an organ concerto, Mademoiselle Boulanger vill [sic] ''play'' it and ''I'' vill [sic] conduct it!"&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; Despite his apprehensiveness about his preparedness to write such a large work — Copland had never heard his own orchestration — Boulanger reassured him that he possessed the skills and talent.

The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra was premiered in New York on January 11, 1925 at [[Aeolian Hall (Manhattan)|Aeolian Hall]], also Boulanger's American debut.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; The Boston premiere took place later that year. The premiere of the re-orchestrated First Symphony did not take place until 1931, when the [[Berliner Symphoniker|Berlin Symphony Orchestra]] performed it under [[Ernest Ansermet]]'s baton.

The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, [[bass clarinet]] in B{{music|flat}}, two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Orchestral percussion|percussion]], two [[harp]]s, [[celesta]], [[Violin family|string]]s, and [[Organ (music)|organ]].&lt;ref name="score: with organ" /&gt;

The First Symphony (the non-organ version) is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets in B{{music|flat}}, bass clarinet in B{{music|flat}}, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, [[alto saxophone]] in E{{music|flat}}, eight horns, five trumpets, three trombones, timpani, percussion, [[piano]], two harps, and strings.&lt;ref name="score: no organ" /&gt;

==Form==
The Organ Symphony contains three movements: a contemplative prelude, a driving scherzo with a "bluesy" trio section, and a moderate tempo finale ranging in character from mournful to unrelenting.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; The work is unusual for a "symphony" in that it only contains three movements and the movements increase in length from start to finish. [[Howard Pollack]], a historian of American composers, states that the work is much more like a [[concerto]], and that its progressive elongation of movements makes the last in particular seem to drag on in spots, but that "such flaws are more than compensated from by the music's vitality, brilliance, and individuality." Pollack further notes:
{{quote|The prelude, more wistful than sad, features that bittersweet, pastoral mood so characteristic of its composer. The scherzo reveals an equally familiar hallmark in its evocation of modern urban life—here propulsive, mechanical, jazzy, with an ironically robotized quotation of the French tune "Au Claire de la Lune," an homage, surely, to Boulanger... The Finale, alternatively dirgelike and urgent (the composer's prophetic voice already making itself heard), ends triumphantly, as his music often does.}}

The tonal material of the prelude can be found in its first four measures, based on the half-step/whole-step [[octatonic scale]] beginning on G{{music|sharp}} (G{{music|sharp}}-A-B-C-D-D{{music|sharp}}-F-F{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}).&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; The use of octatonic scales features prominently in the symphony and serve as a means of changing between tonal centers. This unites the prelude in a ternary form characteristic of Copland, moving the tonal center by a [[tritone]] in the B section.

&lt;!--- The grace note in this example should have a stroke through it; however, using
  the \acciaccatura command instead of the \grace command adds an extra, undesirable slur ---&gt;

Throughout the work, Copland employs a three-note [[Motive (music)|motive]] based on the [[minor triad]].&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; The motive is first heard prominently in the trumpet's first entrance, although it is at the pianissimo [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] level and muted. Used through all three movements, it appears near the end of the work in triple forte (fortessissimo), unifying the Symphony and lending weight to its conclusion.

&lt;/score&gt;

The scherzo movement features a [[polyrhythm]]ic ostinato present through 80% of the movement, based on two 'eighth note, eighth note, eighth rest' figures one eighth-note out of phase. The interlocking rhythms gives a ''[[perpetuum mobile]]'' feel to the movement, whose thematic material derives from it as well.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; Copland stated that the bluesy rhythms found in the scherzo's trio section would not have been there had he not been raised in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt;

  \bar "||"
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The Finale is cast in a modified [[sonata form]], possibly because it was originally intended to open the symphony.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; Copland described the sonata form as comprising a first theme in the violas based on the minor triad motive, a second theme in the strings over a [[Bassline#Walking bass|bass line]] ostinato based on the motive, a development section initiated by the organ including a "vivacious" theme for solo violin, and a short recapitulation that combines these main elements. Pollack contends that sonata form is difficult to grasp in this movement, even for an experienced listener, and likens it to a [[passacaglia]], with "its open unison theme, its [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] exposition, its repetitive bass lines, its lack of clear thematic contrast, and, perhaps above all, its tonal stasis."

==Legacy==
The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra established Copland as a serious modern composer. Musicologist Gayle Murchison posits that his use of the octatonic and whole-tone scales, polyrhythmic ostinato figures, and dissonant counterpoint proves his mastery of  the modernist harmonic, rhythmic, and melodic techniques of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; The work shows much influence of Copland's hero [[Igor Stravinsky]] such as its nervous, driving rhythms and some of its harmonic language, but it also draws significantly and consciously from jazz - Copland's birthright - as in its playful interpretation of triple meter in the scherzo movement.&lt;ref name=Key /&gt; For a decade Copland would continue to draw from jazz in his quest to evoke an essentially "American" sound. His interaction with Maestro Koussevitzky would lead to the latter to conduct 12 of Copland's orchestra pieces as head of the BSO, including several he commissioned and premiered.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt;

The audience at the New York premiere was taken aback by its "radical departure from [[Common practice period|common practice]] conventions.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt;" From the stage, Maestro Damrosch famously remarked, "if a gifted young man can write a symphony like that at age twenty-three, within five years he will be ready to commit murder," which was in Copland's words a joke meant to "smooth the ruffled feathers of his conservative Sunday afternoon ladies faced with modern music.&lt;ref name=Tischler /&gt;" Just as contemporary critics rejected Copland's work for being too jazzy and too modern, receptive conductors and audiences were excited to hear his developing style. Copland himself came to see the work as too "European" and consciously sought to evoke an American idiom in his future work before eventually accepting it as a reflection of his natural idiom.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

'''''The Art of Painting''''', also known as '''''The Allegory of Painting''''',  or '''''Painter in his Studio''''', is a 17th-century [[Oil painting|oil on canvas painting]] by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]]. It is owned by the [[Austrian Republic]] and is on display in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].

This illusionistic painting is one of Vermeer's most famous. In 1868 [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|Thoré-Bürger]], known today for his rediscovery of the work of painter Johannes Vermeer, regarded this painting as his most interesting. [[Svetlana Alpers]] describes it as unique and ambitious;&lt;ref&gt;Svetlana Alpers (1983) ''The Art of Description. Dutch  Art in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Liedtke]] "as a virtuoso display of the artist's power of invention and execution, staged in an imaginary version of his studio ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Dutch paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2007|page=893.|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0-300-12028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Albert Blankert]] "No other painting so flawlessly integrates naturalistic technique, brightly illuminated space, and a complexly integrated composition."&lt;ref&gt;A. Blankert (1978) Vermeer of Delft, pp. 47–49. Oxford: Phaidon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many art historians think that it is an [[allegory]] of [[painting]], hence the alternative title of the painting. Its composition and [[iconography]] make it the most complex Vermeer work of all. After Vermeer's ''[[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|Christ in the House of Martha and Mary]]'' it is his largest work.

==Description==
[[File:Vermeer-ArtPainting-Signatura-1117.jpg|thumb|upright=1|His signature]]

The painting depicts an artist painting a woman dressed in blue posing as a model in his studio. The subject is standing by a window and a large map of the [[Low Countries]] hangs on the wall behind.  It is signed to the right of the girl "I [Oannes] Ver. Meer", but not dated. Most experts assume it was executed sometime between 1665/1668, but some suggest the work could have been created as late as 1670–1675.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokstad|first1=Marilyn|title=Art History|date=1995|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=0810927764|pages=797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1663 Vermeer had been visited by [[Balthasar de Monconys]], but had no painting to show, so it was possibly done "in order to have an outstanding specimen of his art in his studio."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EZxWaNlQKiYC&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;ots=0QFW7Eysuw&amp;dq=Gerard%20van%20Swieten%20Vermeer&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA396#v=onepage&amp;q=Gerard%20van%20Swieten%20Vermeer&amp;f=false Vermeer and the Delft School, p. 396]&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer obviously liked the painting; he never sold it during his lifetime. According to Alpers "it stands as a kind of summary and assessment of what has been done."&lt;ref&gt;S. Alpers, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.at/en/visit/exhibitions/2010/vermeer-the-art-of-painting/ KHM on the "Art of Painting"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Elements===

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - The Art of Painting (detail) - WGA24677.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|Detail of Vermeer's ''Art of Painting'' showing the painter at his [[easel]] using a [[maulstick]].]]

The painting has only two figures, the painter and his subject, a woman with downcast eyes. The painter was thought to be a self-portrait of the artist; [[Jean-Louis Vaudoyer]] suggested the young woman could be his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer's Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice by Benjamin Binstock, p. 172.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj0wbU_GT8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Benjamin%20Binstock%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20of%20Painting%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The painter sits in front of the painting on the easel, where you can see the sketch of the crown. He is dressed in an elegant black garment with cuts on the sleeves and on the back that offers a glimpse of the shirt underneath. He has short puffy breeches and orange stockings, an expensive and fashionable garment that is also found in other works of the time, as in a well-known self-portrait by Rubens.

The tapestry and the chair, both [[repoussoir]]s, lead the viewer into the painting. As in ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' the ceiling can be seen.

Experts attribute [[symbol]]s to various aspects of the painting. A number of the items, a [[plaster]] [[mask]], perhaps representing the debate on [[paragone]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/art_of_painting.html#.U7dG3bG0NgE Essential Vermeer].&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of a piece of cloth, a [[folio]], and some leather on the table have been linked to the symbols of [[Liberal Arts]]. The representation of the marble tiled floor and the splendid golden chandelier are examples of Vermeer's craftsmanship and show his knowledge of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Each object reflects or absorbs light differently, getting the most accurate rendering of material effects.

The map, remarkable is the representation of light on it, shows the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the Netherlands, flanked by 20 views of prominent Dutch cities.&lt;ref&gt;Brussel, Luxemburg, Gent, Bergen (Henegouwen), Amsterdam, Namen, Leeuwarden, Utrecht, Zutphen, en het Hof van Holland in Den Haag; to the right Limburg, Nijmegen, Arras, Dordrecht, Middelburg, Antwerpen, Mechelen, Deventer, Groningen en het Hof van Brabant in Brussel.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by [[Claes Janszoon Visscher]] in 1636. This map, but without the city views on the left and right can be seen on paintings by [[Jacob Ochtervelt]] and [[Nicolaes Maes]]. Similar maps were found in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris &lt;ref&gt;S. Alpers, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Swedish [[Skokloster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartography.geo.uu.nl/research/monumenta.html Monumenta Cartographica Neerlandica I (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the top left of the map two women can be seen; one bearing a [[cross-staff]] and compasses, while the other has a palette, brush, and a city view in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;S. Alpers, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism and allegory===

Vermeer had a theoretical interest for painting. The subject is presumed to be [[Pheme|Fama]],&lt;ref&gt;Neurdenburg, E. (1942) Johannes Vermeer.

Following Vermeer's contemporary [[Gerard de Lairesse]], interested in [[French Classicism]] and Ripa, there is another explanation; he mentions history and poetry as the main resources of a painter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/lair001groo01_01/downloads.php Groot-Schilderboek (1712), pp. 4, 6, 115, 121, 293]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Gregor J.M.

Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 363&lt;/ref&gt; later paraphrased by the Latin poet [[Horace]] as [[ut pictura poesis]]. If so, the map is representing history.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - The Art of Painting (detail) - WGA24678.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Is that a double eagle on top of the chandelier?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johannesvermeer.info/verm/house/hz-chandelier-nl.htm Kroonluchter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041416/http://www.johannesvermeer.info/verm/house/hz-chandelier-nl.htm |date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[double-headed eagle]], symbol of the Habsburg [[Holy Roman Empire]], which possibly adorns the central golden [[chandelier]], may represent the former rulers of the Low Countries. &lt;!--Vermeer was unusual in being a Catholic in a predominantly [[Protestant]] [[Netherlands]]. The absence of candles in the chandelier might represent the suppression of the [[Catholic faith]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}--&gt;
The large map on the back wall has a prominent [[crease pattern|crease]] that divides the Seventeen Provinces into the north and south. (West is at the top of the map.) The crease may symbolize the division between the [[Dutch Republic]] to the north and [[Southern Netherlands|southern provinces]] under Habsburg rule. The map &lt;!--by Visscher (Nicolaum Piscatorem)--&gt; shows the earlier political division between the [[Union of Utrecht]] to the north, and the loyal provinces to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/verm_3.shtm Vermeer: The Art of Painting, Exhibitions – NGA ]&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation might have appealed to Hitler who owned the painting during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer's Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice by Benjamin Binstock, p. 182.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj0wbU_GT8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Benjamin%20Binstock%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20of%20Painting%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Liedtke a political interpretation of the map and the [[Habsburg]] eagle is unconvincing; they overlook other motives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EZxWaNlQKiYC&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;ots=0QFW7Eysuw&amp;dq=Gerard%20van%20Swieten%20Vermeer&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA396#v=onepage&amp;q=Gerard%20van%20Swieten%20Vermeer&amp;f=false Vermeer and the Delft School, p. 396]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is considered a work with significance for Vermeer because he did not part with it or sell it, even when he was in debt. On 24 February 1676, his widow Catharina bequeathed it to her mother, [[Maria Thins]], in an attempt to avoid the sale of the painting to satisfy creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Michael Montias|Montias, J.M.]] (1989) ''Vermeer and his Milieu. A Web of Social History'', pp. 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt; The executor of Vermeer's estate, the famous Delft microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], determined that the transferral of the work to the late painter's mother-in-law was illegal and, according to [[John Michael Montias]], at least a curious transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History by John M. Montias, pp. 219, 229.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Vermeer%20and%20his%20Milieu.%20A%20Web%20of%20Social%20History&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20of%20Painting%22&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Vermeer%20and%20his%20Milieu.%20A%20Web%20of%20Social%20History&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20of%20Painting%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1677 most of his paintings were sold in an auction at the Guild in Delft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/references/provenance.html#.U6U9NLGK4mw Essential Vermeer]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known who bought the Art of Painting; perhaps it was [[Jacob Dissius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alien.mur.at/rax/KUN_POL/KUNST/VERMEER/verhist1.html BESITZFOLGEN]&lt;/ref&gt; It can not determined with certainty whether the painting is quoted in the auction Dissius of 1696 as "Portrait of Vermeer in a room with various accessories."&lt;!--At some time it possibly was acquired by the eminent Dutch physician [[Gerard van Swieten]].--&gt; The painting was owned by [[Gerard van Swieten]], and passed into the hands of [[Gottfried van Swieten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/verm_6.shtm U.S. National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813 it was purchased for 50 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]] by the [[Bohemia]]n-Austrian Count [[Johann Rudolf Czernin von und zu Chudenitz|Rudolf Czernin]]. It was placed on public display in the [[Czernin Museum]] in Vienna.

Until 1860, the painting was considered to be by Vermeer's contemporary [[Pieter de Hooch]]; Vermeer was little known until the late 19th century. Hooch's signature was even forged on the painting. It was at the intervention of the German art historian [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] that it was recognised as a Vermeer original.&lt;ref&gt;Waagen, G.F. "Handbuch der Deutschen und Niederländischen Malerschulen". Stuttgart 1862, Bd II, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alien.mur.at/rax/KUN_POL/KUNST/VERMEER/verbio6.html VERGESSENHEIT UND WIEDERENTDECKUNG]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi interest===
[[File:StollenSalzbergwerkAltaussee.jpg|thumb|left|A tunnel in the [[Altaussee]] salt mine]]

In 1935 Count Jaromir Czernin had tried to sell the painting to [[Andrew W. Mellon]], but the Austrian government prohibited the export of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schikelgruber.net/rapebis.html Hitler and the European Art]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]], Philipp [[Reemtsma]] with the help of Reichsmarschall [[Hermann Göring]] attempted to acquire the painting. The transaction to a private person was refused being [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alien.mur.at/rax/KUN_POL/KUNST/VERMEER/verhist2.html INTERESSENTEN FÜR DAS BILD]&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally acquired by [[Adolf Hitler]] for the collection of the [[Führermuseum|Linzer Museum]] at a price of 1.82 million [[Reichsmark]] through his agent, [[Hans Posse]] on November 20, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/verm_6.shtm Vermeer: The Art of Painting, The Painting's Afterlife – NGA]&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting was rescued from a [[salt mine]] near [[Altaussee]] at the end of World War II in 1945, where it was preserved from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing raids, with other works of art. The painting was escorted to Vienna from Munich by Andrew Ritchie, chief of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFA&amp;A) for Austria, who transported it by locking himself and the painting in a train compartment.&lt;ref&gt;Spirydowicz, K. (2010). "Rescuing Europe's Cultural Heritage: The Role of the Allied Monuments Officers in World War II". ''Archaeology, Cultural Property, and the Military''. L. Rush. Woodbridge, The Boydell Press: 15–27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans presented the painting to the Austrian Government in 1946, since the [[House of Czernin|Czernin family]] were deemed to have sold it voluntarily, without undue force from Hitler.
During the early to mid-1950s Czernin continued in his attempts to claim restitution, each time being rejected. In 1958, Vermeer's ''The Art of Painting'' was finally moved from temporary status into the permanent collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/verm_6.shtm NGA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 request by heirs for restitution ===

{{update-section|date=November 2017}}

In August 2009 a request was submitted by the heirs of the Czernin family to Austria's culture ministry for the return of the painting. A previous request was submitted in 1960s however it was "rejected on the grounds that the sale had been voluntary and the price had been adequate." A 1998 restitution law which pertains to public institutions has bolstered the family's legal position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-18/heirs-claim-for-hitler-s-vermeer-painting-is-rejected-by-austrian-panel.html Heirs’ Claim for Hitler’s Vermeer Rejected by Austrian Panel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.at/en/visit/exhibitions/2010/vermeer-the-art-of-painting/on-the-current-state-of-the-discussion-of-the-provenance-of-vermeers-the-art-of-painting/ KHM]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Salvador Dalí]] refers to ''The Art of Painting'' in his own [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] painting ''[[The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table]]'' (1934). On Dalí's painting the image of Vermeer from ''The Art of Painting'', although not true to the representation regarding Vermeer's clothes, is viewed from his back, re-created as a strange kind of table.

'''The Singing Senators''' were a group of U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senators]] who sang as a [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] quartet.

== Members ==
Representation as of 2000:

* Fmr. Sen. [[John Ashcroft]] (R-Missouri) – [[Baritone]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[Larry Craig]] (R-Idaho) – [[Singer#Lead and backing vocalists|Lead]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[James Jeffords]] (R-Vermont 1989-2001) (I-Vermont 2001-2007) – [[Tenor]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[Trent Lott]] (R-Mississippi) – [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]]

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1995, at New Hampshire Senator [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]]'s birthday party, Ashcroft, Jeffords, Lott, and [[Connie Mack III|Connie Mack]] of Florida sang "Happy Birthday". Later, when Senator [[Bob Packwood]] of [[Oregon]] was having a birthday party, Jeffords called Lott and suggested that the four of them sing at the party. Mack declined, but Larry Craig joined. According to his autobiography, ''[[Herding Cats, A Life in Politics]]'', Lott formed the group in large part to improve relations between the Republican Conference, of which Lott was Majority Leader, and Jeffords, a Republican who frequently voted with the Democrats.

During the initial years, the four Senators usually practiced in Lott's hideaway office.  [[Guy Hovis]], the Mississippi state director for Lott, was a talented musician who gave the Senators some training. They all practiced together every day.

=== 1995–2000 ===
Their first official performance of the group was in October 1995 at a Young Political Leaders of America meeting.&lt;ref name="Fed"&gt;Amy Phillips, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thefed/v3/volume18/8/singingsenators.shtml "The Singing Senators: Behind the 'Music'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007155914/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thefed/v3/volume18/8/singingsenators.shtml |date=2006-10-07 }}, ''The Fed'', volume 18, issue 8, April 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1995, the group appeared on [[Today (NBC program)|''The Today Show'']].&lt;ref name="ORB"/&gt;

In April 1996, the [[Oak Ridge Boys]] sang with the group at a Senate reception,&lt;ref name="ORB"&gt;[http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators_branson.html One Fabulous Sing-a-Long"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022183709/http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators_branson.html |date=2006-10-22 }}, Oak Ridge Boys website, accessed June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; something described in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', a Capitol Hill newspaper, as "Congressional Harmony". In September 1996 the group performed again with the Oak Ridge Boys in [[Branson, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="ORB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators.html Press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035649/http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators.html |date=2007-09-28 }}, Oak Ridge Boys, accessed June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the senators sang at the [[1996 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmanu.org/publications/thedelta/vol_114c.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623152303/http://www.sigmanu.org/publications/thedelta/vol_114c.asp |archivedate=2006-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the group released their only album, ''Let Freedom Sing'',  a ten-song CD recorded in Nashville.&lt;ref name="Fed"/&gt; In 2000, clips of the group's songs could be streamed from the Senate pages of Ashcroft and Jeffords.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Dean, [https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35525 "They Put the Party in GOP"], ''Wired'', April 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Ashcroft lost his [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|Senate re-election race]] (he was appointed [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in early 2001).  In May 2001, Jeffords announced he was leaving the Republican Party to become an [[independent (politician)|Independent]], returning control of the Senate to the Democrats.  The two events, combined, led to the apparent demise of the group.&lt;ref name="Fed"/&gt;

=== Revival ===
In October 2006, Singing Senators Lott and Craig said they were putting the quartet back together after a six-year hiatus. They said they had found two solid prospects in Senators [[Robert Foster Bennett|Bob Bennett]] (R-Utah) and [[John Thune]] (R-S.D.)&lt;ref&gt;Emily Heil, [http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/hasterts-great-listening-skills-2006-10-11.html "Under the Dome: American Idol,  Senate style"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000614/http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/hasterts-great-listening-skills-2006-10-11.html |date=2008-09-08 }}, ''The Hill'', October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Singing Senators Ashcroft, Craig, and Lott gave their first public performance in more than six years. Senator Craig was subsequently inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame, having been selected in March 2007. Craig said that the group was now a [[trio (music)|trio]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061302469.html "A Homegrown Talent Returns for a Premiere"], ''Washington Post'', June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lott's announced resignation in 2007 seemed to put the existence of even a trio in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/27/AR2007112702382.html Al Kamen - Without Lott, the Singing Senators Are of One Voice - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Craig's decision to not run for another term in 2008—due in part to the controversy over his [[Larry Craig#2007 arrest and consequences|arrest for solicitation]] the previous year—spelled the formal end of the group.

==Other singing legislators==
* [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah), a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], is also a [[religious music]] artist. During 2002 he earned $18,009 in income from sales of his own recordings, according to a Senate financial disclosure; this was his highest annual intake from his singing.&lt;ref&gt;http://my.aol.com/news/news_story.psp?type=4&amp;cat=0800&amp;id=03061119382482745&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Second Amendments]], made up of five Congressmen from the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].
* [[MP4 (band)|MP4]], who are a British rock group comprising 4 UK politicians (3 serving Members of Parliament and 1 former Member of Parliament).

{{Art and video games}}
The concept of '''video games as a form of art''' is a controversial topic within the [[entertainment industry]]. Though [[video game]]s have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the philosophical proposition that video games are works of [[art]] remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even [[art game]]s, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Art World for Artgames| author=Felan Parker| url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/view/119| journal=Loading...| volume=7| issue=11| pages= 54–55| year=2013| publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]| issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated [[History of video games (first-generation systems)|first]] and [[History of video games (second generation)|second generation]] games. In exhibitions such as the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]'s 1989 "Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art.&lt;ref name=stalker&gt;Stalker, Phillipa Jane. ''[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/1749 Gaming In Art: A Case Study Of Two Examples Of The Artistic Appropriation Of Computer Games And The Mapping Of Historical Trajectories Of 'Art Games' Versus Mainstream Computer Games]''. [[University of the Witwatersrand]], Johannesburg. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://www.crudeoils.us/artwrite/August2002/Holmes.htm Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade]''. Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference (Tampere, Finland); Art Gallery, [[SIGGRAPH|Siggraph 2002]]. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the online "Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art" (1999),&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Pratt, Charles J. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27133/The_Art_History_Of_Games_Games_As_Art_May_Be_A_Lost_Cause.php The Art History... Of Games? Games As Art May Be A Lost Cause]''. [[Gamasutra]]. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] Beall Centre's "Shift-Ctrl" (2000),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; and a number of shows in 2001.&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt;

The concept of the video game as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]-style [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] or as [[found object]] resonated with early developers of the [[art game]]. In her 2003 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] paper, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the [[digital art]] community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Burgertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420092835/http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf |date=April 20, 2013 }}''. [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC 2003]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating [[art mod]]s for more complex games like ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the [[New Games|New Games Movement]] had paved the way for more modern "art games". Works such as Lantz' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'', according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In March 2006, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] first characterized video games as cultural goods and as "a form of artistic expression," granting the industry a tax subsidy&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema]''. [[New York Times]]. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and inducting two French game designers ([[Michel Ancel]], [[Frédérick Raynal]]) and one Japanese game designer ([[Shigeru Miyamoto]]) into the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In May 2011, the United States [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include "interactive games", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]''. In Germany, prior to August 2018, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) software ratings body enforced [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' (German code) section 86a]] as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-09-germany-relaxes-stance-on-nazi-symbols-in-video-games | title= Germany relaxes stance on Nazi symbols in video games | first = Matthew | last = Handrahan | date = August 9, 2018 | accessdate = August 9, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/german-ratings-board-starts-allowing-nazi-symbols-in-video-games/ | title = Germany says games with Nazi symbols can get “artistic” exception to ban | first=  Kyle | last= Orland | date = August 10, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dd44ce45-d5cf-4189-a1b6-7bcc7e31605f | title = German Attorney General: Video game with Swastika does not violate the law; constitutes art | first=  Baker | last=McKinsey | date = May 8, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Lexology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both [[game]] and [[interactive art]]. The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] held an exhibit in 2012, entitled "[[The Art of Video Games]]", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian exhibit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | title = Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games | publisher = [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] | accessdate = 2011-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051435/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | archive-date = 2011-08-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian later added ''Flower'' and ''[[Halo 2600]]'', games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/17/5222078/smithsonian-acquires-flower-halo-2600-for-its-permanent-collection | title = Smithsonian acquires Flower, Halo 2600 for its permanent collection | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = 2013-12-17 | accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|aims to collect]] forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to "celebrate gaming as an artistic medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/11/moma-videogames/ | title = MoMA to Exhibit Videogames, From Pong to Minecraft | first = Olivia | last = Solon | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date  = 2012-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual "[[Into the Pixel]]" art exhibit held at the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] highlights [[video game art]] selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/video-games/pixels-floating-on-the-art-worlds-margins.html | title = Pixels Floating on the Art World’s Margins | first = Harold | last=  Goldberg | date = 2013-06-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-15 | work = [[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy games===
{{anchor|Empathy game}}
While many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/9/4313246/gamings-new-frontier-cancer-depression-suicide | title = Gaming's New Frontier: Cancer, Depression, Suicide | first = Colin | last =Campbell | date = May 9, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010641205335768 | title = Videogames About Alcoholism, Depression and Cancer | first = Conon | last = Dougherty | date = August 15, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as a game that "asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/empathy-gaming-focuses-on-emotions-and-moral-decisions-20140904-10ch4z.html | title = 'Empathy gaming' focuses on emotions and moral decisions | first = Patrick | last = Begley | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.

===Legal status===
American courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] as under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], in March 1982 in the case of ''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.'', 536 F.Supp. 170, D.C.N.Y., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, [[precedent]] began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some ''elements'' of video games.&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick'', 115 F.Supp.2d 943 (S.D.Ind.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]], upon reviewing gameplay from "'[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|The Resident of Evil Creek]]'{{sic}}, '[[Mortal Combat]]'{{sic}}, '[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]],' and '[[Fear Effect]]'" ruled in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'' that "just like [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Ass'n v. St. Louis County, Mo.'', 200 F.Supp.2d 1126, E.D.Mo.,2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, James. "[http://www.salon.com/2002/05/06/games_as_speech/ Playing games with free speech]". ''Salon''. 6 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, "Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/27/supreme.court.video.game.art/|work=CNN|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=Supreme Court sees video games as art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of legitimation===
Emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Keith Stewart, games editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists.&lt;ref name="bizStewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-13-the-first-guardian-keith-stuart-on-getting-games-into-culture|work=gamesindustry.biz|last=Pearson|first=Dan|title=The First Guardian: Keith Stuart on getting games into Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced [[auteur theory]] of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the "cultural discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art  |journal= [[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date= October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game.&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat-427544|work=International Business Times|last=Smith|first=Edward|title=Indie Games Aren't Art Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of [[art game]]s attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be [[low culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including [[Anna Anthropy]],&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; [[Lucy Kellaway]],&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; and [[Jim Munroe]],&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"/&gt; who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.

Munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/10/repeat-of-spark-126-october-16-19-2011 Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=October 29, 2014 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game designer [[Kim Swift]] believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/kim-swift-interview/|work=WIRED|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Portal Designer Kim Swift Won't Let You Take Her Toys Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Ebert on video games as art===
The question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic [[Roger Ebert]] participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was essential to a proper appreciation of the film ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game,&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;Moriarty, Brian; Caoili, Eric (ed.). ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/03/opinion_brian_moriartys_apolog.php Opinion: Brian Moriarty's Apology For Roger Ebert]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:

{{quote|text=To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders | title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? | date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] entitled "An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url  = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/SCANNERS/60418001 | title = Video games: The 'epic debate' | first  =Jim | last =Emerson | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | title = An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form? | conference = 62nd Annual Conference on World Affairs | conferenceurl = http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/search_results.html?date=7&amp;year=2006 | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in response to comments from [[Clive Barker]] on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 | title=  Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker  | date = 2007-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by [[Kellee Santiago]] of [[thatgamecompany]] at the 2009 [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment Design Conference]], where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | title = Video games can never be art | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 2010-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010001841/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | archive-date = 2011-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a [''[[sic]]''] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"/&gt;}}

Ebert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1621426/game-designer-kellee-santiago-responds-to-roger-eberts-video-games-are-not-art-rant | title= Game Designer Kellee Santiago Responds to Roger Ebert's "Video Games Are Not Art" Rant  | first = Dan | last = Nosowitz | date = 2010-04-20 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/alt-text-videogames-as-art/ | title = Alt Text: Are Videogames Art?

Moving On… [My Response to Ebert] | first = Kellee | last = Santiago | date =2010-04-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[thatgamecompany]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later amended his comments in 2010, conceding that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense, that he had enjoyed playing ''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]'', and addressing some replies to his original arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |title=Okay, kids, play on my lawn |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003526/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered [[fine art]] due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary [[Brian Moriarty]] who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled ''An [[Apologetics|Apology]] For Roger Ebert''.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that [[Romanticism|Romantics]] like Ebert, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that "Hardly any movies are art."&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of "art" to include [[low art]], comparing video games to [[kitsch]] and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as [[Camp (style)|camp]]. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in [[indie games]] and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the "slippery" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term "art" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, [[Zach Gage]].&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt;

===Other notable critics===
In a 2006 interview with ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine|US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]'', game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ellie. ''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240106kojimaart Games aren't art, says Kojima]''. Eurogamer. 24 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]]), argued in no uncertain terms that games "are not art" and that they are by and large "a waste of time." Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by [[Play (activity)|play]], argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of [[game]]s, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as "art games," however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as "art games," noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of "the game" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then "life must be breathed into the carcass" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as "not games."&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on [[gameplay mechanics]] as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient [[Video game development|development team]] who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of "[[fun]]ness" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Samyn, Michael. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_291/8608-Almost-Art Almost Art]''. [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]. 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs "one person’s reaction to life" and that "no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2012-11-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] in the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Photopia]]''. The solution of the puzzle involves a [[Reveal (narrative)|reveal]] regarding the player's controlled [[Player character|playable character]], prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made "as powerful as they are" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and the [[present tense]], which are "fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2013/01/19/a-moment-of-perfect-beauty/|title=A Moment of Perfect Beauty|date=2013-01-19|work=Nightmare Mode [Archived]|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14441">'''William Kurtz Wimsatt Jr.''' (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the [[intentional fallacy]], which he developed with [[Monroe Beardsley]] in order to discuss the importance of an author's intentions for the creation of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Wimsatt, William K. and Monroe C. Beardsley. "The Intentional Fallacy." Sewanee Review, vol. 54 (1946): 468-488. Revised and republished in The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry, U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Wimsatt was born in [[Washington D.C.]], attended [[Georgetown University]] and, later, [[Yale University]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of [[literary theory]] and [[criticism]] such as ''The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson'' (1941) and ''Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the "Rambler" and "Dictionary" of [[Samuel Johnson]]'' (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' (1954); ''Hateful Contraries'' (1965) and ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' (1957, with [[Cleanth Brooks]]). Wimsatt was considered crucial to [[New Criticism]] (particularly New [[Formalism (literature)|Formalist]] Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

== Influences ==
Wimsatt was influenced by [[Monroe Beardsley]], with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] and [[Aristotle]], and some of his own contemporaries, such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and the writers of the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]], to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors' works in order to refute them.

== Influence ==

Wimsatt's ideas have affected the development of [[reader-response criticism]], and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as [[Stanley Fish]], and in works such as [[Walter Benn Michaels]]' and [[Steven Knapp]]’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).

== Approach ==

Wimsatt was interviewed, along with [[Walter J. Ong]], S.J., of [[Saint Louis University]], by Sheila Hough on the 327th edition of the radio talk-show Yale Reports, broadcast on May 24, 1964, by WTIC-Hartford. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1963.) Ms. Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: "Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don't you consider the person who wrote it?"

Wimsatt replied: "I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book ''The Barbarian Within'' [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in ''Essays in Criticism'' at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, [[Monroe Beardsley]], and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours."

As a staunch [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with [[Monroe Beardsley]], “[[intentional fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]” and “[[affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).

Wimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).

Much of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards "[[impressionism]], [[subjectivism]], and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In ''Hateful Contraries'', Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as [[Leslie Fiedler]]’s “Credo,” which appeared in the ''[[Kenyon Review]]''. “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (''Hateful Contraries'' xvi).

Indeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of a soul adventuring among masterpieces” (''Verbal Icon'' 29).

== Theories ==

Wimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, ''The Verbal Icon'' (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?

=== Intentional fallacy ===
{{main|Intentional fallacy}}

Perhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in ''Verbal Icon'') which he wrote with [[Monroe Beardsley]]. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).

The [[Intentional Fallacy]], according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (''Verbal Icon'' 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “[[Genetic fallacy]]” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience(see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy" for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).

=== Affective fallacy ===
{{main|Affective fallacy}}

The Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]], as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its ''results''” (''Verbal Icon 21''; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.

Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]] argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).

As with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]], it is a fallacy of analysis.

=== Concrete Universal ===

In “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (''Verbal Icon'' 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes [[poetry]] different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).

=== The Domain of Criticism ===

In “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general [[aesthetics|aesthetician]]" (''Verbal Icon'' 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely [[aesthetic]] terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.

Verbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of [[aesthetics]] — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).

More importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its [[rhyme]] and meter, but these are the domains of [[aesthetics]] (231) — to analyse [[poetry]] on the basis of its [[aesthetics]], then, is insufficient in one is to adequately explore its meaning.

== Major works ==

=== ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' ===

Written as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, ''The Verbal Icon'' was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, ''The Verbal Icon'' contains two of Wimsatt's most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]]). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt's text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of 'autonomy' in New Criticism, in ''Blindness and Insight''.

=== ''Hateful Contraries: Studies in Literature and Criticism'' ===

Apparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published ''Hateful Contraries'' in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve [[literary criticism]] (xix).

=== ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' ===

Written with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1957, ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).
