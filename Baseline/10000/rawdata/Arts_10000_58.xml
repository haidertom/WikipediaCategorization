'''''ArtAsiaPacific''''' is the longest running English-language periodical solely dedicated to covering [[contemporary art]] and [[culture]] from sixty-seven countries, territories, and [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|Chinese Special Administrative Regions]] that it considers to be within Asia, the Pacific, and the Middle East. It is published six times a year and is distributed internationally. A regular issue includes feature-length articles on artists, themes or events; essays; profiles on artists or collectors; reviews of biennials, exhibitions, art publications and films; news including obituaries and appointments; auction and art fair reports; and previews of shows. 

''ArtAsiaPacific'' produces an annual [[almanac]] edition, published in January, which surveys the past year in the 67 countries and territories covered in the magazine. In addition to news, exhibition, festival and country reports, the almanac includes reports on five outstanding artists from the previous year and one promising artist for the next year, and essays written by prominent curators and cultural figures.

==History==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Backissuecover1.jpg|thumb|''Art and Asia Pacific'' Issue no.1, June 1993]] --&gt;
The magazine first launched as ''Art and Asia Pacific'' in June 1993 in Australia. Published quarterly, it began more as an academic journal than a standard consumer magazine and each issue would focus on a different country or theme. While the first issue was published by Janet Gough, it was then published and edited by Dynah Dysart/Fine Art Press Pty Limited, [[Sydney]], until October 2003. It was then  purchased by Gang Zhao and Wendy Siegelman and moved to New York.

In the fall of 2004, Elaine W. Ng took over as editor-in-chief, and eventually purchased and co-published the magazine along with author [[Simon Winchester]] in March 2005, effectively re-launching it under the slogan "Today's Art From Tomorrow's World." This marked a dramatic movement in the magazine's design and focus; the editorial content became more journalistic and reader-friendly. In 2006, the first almanac edition of the magazine was released with the goal of covering the past year in Asian art and culture along with profiles and informational listings of each of the 67 countries covered by the magazine.

As of January 2007, Elaine W. Ng is the sole publisher and editor-in-chief of the magazine. Formerly, produced in an office in the gallery district of [[Manhattan| Manhattan's]] [[Chelsea (Manhattan)|Chelsea]] neighborhood, the magazine moved production to [[Hong Kong]] in 2011.

==List of notable contributors==
A number of important figures within the contemporary art world have contributed to ''ArtAsiaPacific'', including:

==Notable cover appearances==

The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2895">'''Audrey Lily Eagle''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (born 1925) is an eminent [[New Zealand]] [[botanical illustrator]], whose work has mainly focused on New Zealand's distinctive [[List of trees native to New Zealand|trees and shrubs]]. As the author and illustrator of the two volume ''Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand'' Eagle has made a notable contribution to [[New Zealand botany]].&lt;ref name="Te Papa 2013"&gt;Brownsey, Dr Patrick (2013). "Introduction". In
Eagle, Audrey. ''The Essential Audrey Eagle''. Wellington: [[Te Papa Press]], 2013, pp. 21–23. {{ISBN|978-1-877385-90-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Eagle began in 1954 to paint plants in order to assist with learning their botanical names. By 1968 she started planning a book with examples of every [[genus]] of tree and shrub in New Zealand. In 1975, after more than twenty years of work, ''Eagle's Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand in Colour'' was published.  The book contained illustrations of 228 [[species]], reproduced in life-size, with meticulous notes on identification, distribution and the source of the illustrated material. In 1982, she published a second book, illustrating a further 405 species and varieties. Both books were revised in 1986 to bring the [[nomenclature]] up to date. However, as a result of botanical research, a further revision was necessary. In 2006 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa Press]] published the two-volume edition incorporating all of Eagle's previous illustrations, together with a further 173 new paintings, under the title ''Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand''.&lt;ref name="Te Papa 2013" /&gt;

==Awards==
Eagle was made a Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] in the [[2001 Birthday Honours|2001 Queen's Birthday Honours]] for services to botanical art. In 2007 the 2006 two-volume edition of ''Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand'' earned her the [[New Zealand Post Book Awards|Montana Medal]] for Non-Fiction and the Booksellers Choice award.  The [[University of Otago]] conferred an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the University of Otago|honorary doctor]] of science degree on her in [[Dunedin]] at a graduation ceremony on 4 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Otago 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibb|first1=John|title='Bit overwhelmed' by honorary doctorate|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/university-otago/255469/bit-overwhelmed-honorary-doctorate|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=Otago Daily Times|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayala Zacks-Abramov''' ({{lang-he|אילה זקס-אברמוב}}, 
1912 &amp;ndash; 30 August 2011) was an [[Israel]]i-[[Canadians|Canadian]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/canadas-peggy-guggenheim-ayala-zacksabramov-dies Canada's Peggy Guggenheim Ayala Zacks-Abramov Dies - ArtLyst]&lt;/ref&gt; [[art collector]]. Ayala was widowed three times, and was previously married to the Canadian art collector Samuel Jacob Zacks and to the knesset member [[Zalman Abramov]].

==Biography==
Zacks-Abramov was born in Jerusalem in 1912 as Ayala Ben-Tovim. Her parents, Shmuel Ben-Tovim and Rashe (née: Berman) were married in Jerusalem in 1902. She studied in London and in Paris where she met her first husband, Morris Fleg, whom she married in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], he joined the [[French Resistance]] after Fleg enlisted to the army and was killed during a military operation.

In 1947, she married Samuel Zacks, a Canadian economist and art collector, whom she met during her stay in [[Switzerland]]. After marrying, the couple began to collect art items from the 19th century and the 20th century, mainly of French, Canadian and Israeli artists such as [[Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Chagall]]. They also acquired art by Israeli artists such as [[Marcel Janco]], [[Mordechai Ardon]], [[Reuven Rubin]] and [[Anna Ticho]], and art of relatively unknown artists at the time of the purchase such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Yigal Tumarkin]] and [[Joseph Zaritsky]].

In 1970, her husband Zacks died. She returned to Israel in 1976 and married Zalman Abramov, who was a lawyer and a Knesset member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1373523 מתה פטרונית האמנות אילה זקס אברמוב - גלריה - הארץ]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were [[Patronage|patrons of the arts]], and Abramov continued to support the art world even after her husband's death in 1997.

Zachs-Abramov supported over the years the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] and the [[Israel Museum]] and had a hand in their growth. Both the museums have halls named after her. She mentioned these museums in her will, in which she declared that her art collection would be divided between them.

The Israeli notable painter [[Joseph Zaritsky]] painted a well-known figurative portrait of her.

Many of the art works in Zachs-Abramov's possession were donated or loaned through to years to museums in Israel, France and Canada.

[[File:Rozeta Paryż notre-dame chalger.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rayonnant]] [[rose window]] in [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In [[Gothic architecture]], [[light]] was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in its design.]]

'''Beauty'''  is a property or characteristic of an [[animal]], [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]] or [[Contentment|satisfaction]]. Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[culture]], [[social psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

[[Unattractiveness|Ugliness]] is considered to be the opposite of beauty.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]]. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and [[health]] thereof, beauty has been stated to have levels of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] as well.

There is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by [[natural selection]]; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|title=A Darwinian theory of beauty|author=|date=|website=ted.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211012601/http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|archivedate=February 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek==
The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words "beauty" or "beautiful" was [[wikt:κάλλος|κάλλος]], ''kallos'', and the adjective was καλός, ''kalos''. However, ''kalos'' may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, ''kallos'' was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65&lt;/ref&gt; an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"&gt;Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"/&gt;

The [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029647-6}}. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "Lives of Artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

==Middle Ages==
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher|Catholic philosophers]] like [[Thomas Aquinas]] included beauty among the [[Transcendentals|transcendental]] attributes of [[being]].  In his [[Summa Theologica]], Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (Wholeness), consonantia (harmony), claritas (radiance of form)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1039.htm#article8 Summa Theologica, Part 1, Question 39, Article 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gothic Architecture of the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]], light was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in design.  Examples are the [[Stained glass#Medieval_glass_in_Europe|stained glass]] of Gothic [[Cathedral|Cathedrals]] including [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Chartes Cathedral]].

==The Age of Reason==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. The goddess Venus is the classical personification of beauty.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".&lt;ref&gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

==The Romantic period==
In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==The 20th century and after==
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love and Beauty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.&lt;ref&gt;On Beauty and Being Just&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of [[experimental aesthetics]] and [[neuroesthetics]] respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of [[pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Rolf|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Winkielman|first3=Piotr|date=2004|title=Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15582859|hdl=1956/594|url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/8/4/364.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|last2=Detweiler-Bedell|first2=Brian|date=December 2008|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/12/4/305/|journal=Review of General Psychology|language=English|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558|issn=1939-1552|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.1825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Oshin|last2=Navarrete|first2=Gorka|last3=Chatterjee|first3=Anjan|last4=Fich|first4=Lars Brorson|last5=Leder|first5=Helmut|last6=Modroño|first6=Cristián|last7=Nadal|first7=Marcos|last8=Rostrup|first8=Nicolai|last9=Skov|first9=Martin|date=2013-06-18|title=Impact of contour on aesthetic judgments and approach-avoidance decisions in architecture|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_2/10446|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=Supplement 2|pages=10446–10453|doi=10.1073/pnas.1301227110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3690611|pmid=23754408|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628045618/http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_2/10446|archivedate=June 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marin|first=Manuela M.|last2=Lampatz|first2=Allegra|last3=Wandl|first3=Michaela|last4=Leder|first4=Helmut|date=2016-11-04|title=Berlyne Revisited: Evidence for the Multifaceted Nature of Hedonic Tone in the Appreciation of Paintings and Music|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2016.00536|issn=1662-5161|pmc=5095118|pmid=27867350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brielmann|first=Aenne A.|last2=Pelli|first2=Denis G.|date=2017-05-22|title=Beauty Requires Thought|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(17)30427-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=27|issue=10|pages=1506–1513.e3|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.018|issn=0960-9822|pmid=28502660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawabata|first=Hideaki|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=April 2004|title=Neural correlates of beauty|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=91|issue=4|pages=1699–1705|doi=10.1152/jn.00696.2003|issn=0022-3077|pmid=15010496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishizu|first=Tomohiro|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=2011-07-06|title=Toward A Brain-Based Theory of Beauty|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021852|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21852|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021852|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3130765|pmid=21755004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830234420/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0021852|archivedate=August 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Bevil R.|last2=Rehding|first2=Alexander|date=2013-03-19|title=Neuroaesthetics and the Trouble with Beauty|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001504|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e1001504|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001504|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3601993|pmid=23526878|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608234118/http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001504|archivedate=June 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fresco of a Roman woman from [[Pompeii]], c. 50 AD]]
The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "[[averageness]]".&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990"&gt;Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L. (1990). "Attractive faces are only average." ''Psychol. Sci.''

This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]] overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.&lt;ref name="Galton, 1878"&gt;Galton, F. (1878). Composite portraits, made by combining those of many different persons in a single resultant figure. '' J. Anthropol. Inst.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3682657.stm|title=Hourglass figure fertility link|last=|first=|date=4 May 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4953-barbie-shaped-women-more-fertile/|title=Barbie-shaped women more fertile|last=Bhattacharya|first=Shaoni|date=5 May 2004|website=New Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal.

Beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Kathryn|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|date=2018-10-05|title=Internalised White Ideal, Skin Tone Surveillance, and Hair Surveillance Predict Skin and Hair Dissatisfaction and Skin Bleaching among African American and Indian Women|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|journal=Sex Roles|doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weedon|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2007|title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective|url=|journal=Gender Forum Electronic Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black is beautiful]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DoCarmo|first=|date=December 20, 2007|title=Dr. DoCarmo's Notes on the Black Cultural Movement|url=|journal=|publisher=Bucks County Community College|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to the thin ideal in mass media, such as fashion magazines, directly correlates with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and the development of eating disorders among female viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/media-eating-disorders|title=Media &amp; Eating Disorders|date=2017-10-05|work=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Model's link to teenage anorexia|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2000|website=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=October 3, 2009|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Further, the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow, highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eating-disorders.org.uk/information/the-media-eating-disorders/|title=National Centre for Eating Disorders - The Media &amp; Eating Disorders|last=Jade|first=Deanne|date=|work=National Centre for Eating Disorders|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multibillion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and magazine covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.doctornerdlove.com/new-impossible-standards-male-beauty/|title=The New (And Impossible) Standards of Male Beauty|last=|first=|date=2015-01-26|work=Paging Dr. NerdLove|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurocentrism and beauty ===
The prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher [[Cornel West]] elaborates that, "much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Matters|last=West|first=Cornel|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/socabs/docview/233235409/334D89ECD5AB4AF8PQ/1?accountid=11243|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, internalized [[colorism]] is rooted in Indian culture, in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the [[skin whitening]] industry; products like [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair &amp; Lovely]] thrive in India, with endorsement from [[Bollywood]] celebrities, as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film, media, and advertising industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shevde|first=Natasha|date=|title=All's Fair in Love and Cream: A Cultural Case Study of Fair &amp; Lovely in India|url=http://www.michelepolak.com/200fall11/Weekly_Schedule_files/Sheyde.pdf|journal=Advertising &amp; Society Review|volume=9|pages=1-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, such Eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through Indian culture, and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals. Further, a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of India, as fairer complexioned North Indians are culturally associated with beauty, intelligence, and wealth, based merely on adherence to Eurocentric beauty ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;t=continent:Asia!Asia/country:India!India&amp;sort=YMD_date:D&amp;maxresults=20&amp;f=advanced&amp;val-base-0=colorism&amp;fld-base-0=alltext&amp;docref=news/165B3F3483519048|title=50 Shades of Colorism in India|last=Youth|first=Awaaz|date=|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Stephanie N.|last2=Keum|first2=Brian TaeHyuk|last3=Caffarel|first3=Daniel|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Ranjana|last5=Morshedian|first5=Negar|last6=Capodilupo|first6=Christina M.|last7=Brewster|first7=Melanie E.|date=December 2017|title=Exploring the conceptualization of body image for Asian American women.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/aap0000077|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=296–307|doi=10.1037/aap0000077|issn=1948-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/papers/homoegenization-of-asian-beauty/|title=The Homogenization of Asian Beauty - The Society Pages|last=Le|first=C.N|date=June 4, 2014|website=thesocietypages.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams, [[rhinoplasty]], and [[blepharoplasty]] (an eyelid surgery meant to give Asians a more European, "double-eyelid" appearance) commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

Researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Begley|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597 |title=The Link Between Beauty and Grades |work=Newsweek |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420004627/http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597| archivedate=April 20, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive "defendants" are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime).&lt;ref&gt;Amina A Memon, Aldert Vrij, Ray Bull (2003). ''Psychology and Law: Truthfulness, Accuracy and Credibility''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 46–47. {{ISBN|047086835X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author, [[Eva Ritvo]], show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/galderma/38432 |title=Image survey reveals "perception is reality" when it comes to teenagers |publisher=multivu.prnewswire.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710073856/http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/galderma/38432 |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lorenz |first=K. |year=2005 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ |title=Do pretty people earn more? |work=[[CNN News]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |agency=[[Cable News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, women's looks are at a premium, but men's looks do not matter much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Daniel Hamermesh |author2=Stephen J.

Franklin was a leading author, printer, [[List of political philosophers|political theorist]], politician, [[freemason]], postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the [[American Enlightenment]] and the [[history of physics]] for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], and the [[Franklin stove]], among other inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor |url=http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html |publisher=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305234033/http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html |archivedate=March 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded many civic organizations, including the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]], [[Philadelphia]]'s first [[Union Fire Company|fire department]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burt | first = Nathaniel | title = The Perennial Philadelphians: The Anatomy of an American Aristocracy | publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1693-6 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=L9ueb6r1uXgC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Union+Fire+Company%22 | page = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial unity]], initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first [[United States Ambassador to France]], he exemplified the emerging American nation.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In the words of historian [[Henry Steele Commager]], "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of [[Puritanism]] without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Walter Isaacson]], this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Benjamin Franklin'' (2003), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' at the age of 23.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2bPCEbMAvwC&amp;pg=PA390 The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin]''. (2010). p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; He became wealthy publishing this and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', which he authored under the [[pseudonym]] "Richard Saunders". After 1767, he was associated with the ''[[Pennsylvania Chronicle]]'', a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of British policies.

He pioneered and was first president of [[Academy and College of Philadelphia]] which opened in 1751 and later became the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He organized and was the first secretary of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[France–United States relations|Franco-American relations]]. His efforts proved vital for the [[American Revolution]] in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.

He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the [[American Revolution|revolution]], he became the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|governor of Pennsylvania]]. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against [[slavery]] from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].

His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on [[Franklin half dollar|coinage]] and the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]], [[USS Benjamin Franklin (SSBN-640)|warships]], and [[List of places named for Benjamin Franklin|the names of many towns]], counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless [[Benjamin Franklin in popular culture|cultural references]].

==Ancestry==
Benjamin Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]], was a [[tallow]] [[Chandlery|chandler]], a [[soaper]] and [[candle]]maker. Josiah was born at [[Ecton, Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of blacksmith and farmer Thomas Franklin, and Jane White. Benjamin's father and all four of his grandparents were born in [[England]]. Josiah had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated with her to [[Boston]] in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. Following her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]]. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

Abiah Folger was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]], a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, [[Mary Morrell Folger]], a former [[indentured servant]]. She came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to [[Massachusetts]] for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]], when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was "the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[court clerk|clerk of the court]], he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy [[William Penn|Penn]] family that owned the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].

==Early life in Boston==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], Boston, Massachusetts]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace site directly across from the [[Old South Meeting House]] is commemorated by a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] atop the second floor facade of this building.]]

Benjamin Franklin was born on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], in [[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on January 17, 1706,&lt;ref name="Engber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="calendar group=Note"&gt;Contemporary records, which used the Julian calendar and the [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, recorded his birth as January 6, 1705. The provisions of the British [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], implemented in 1752, altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year. For a further explanation, see: [[Old Style and New Style dates]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at Old South Meeting House. He was one of seventeen children born to [[Josiah Franklin]], and one of ten born by Josiah's second wife, Abiah Folger; the daughter of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill]]. Among Benjamin's siblings were his older brother [[James Franklin (printer)|James]] and his younger sister [[Jane Mecom|Jane]].

Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy, but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended [[Boston Latin School]] but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although "his parents talked of the church as a career"&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book |last= Franklin |first= Benjamin |authormask= 2 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qW4VAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |series= Macmillan's pocket English and American classics |origyear= 1771 |year= 1901 |publisher=Macmillan |location= New York |page= vi |chapter= Introduction}}&lt;!-- Note: the introduction of this edition is the source for this quote; please do not change the edition without verifying the quote remains sourced. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]].

When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of "[[Silence Dogood]]", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood (quoting ''[[Cato's Letters]]'') proclaim: "Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, (2003) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a [[fugitive from justice|fugitive]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"&gt;Carl Van Doren, ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia==

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith]] to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

===Junto and library===
[[File:Franklin - ita, 1825 - 766672 R.jpeg|thumb|upright|''La scuola della economia e della morale'' (1825)]]
In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of "like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community." The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of the Junto see Michael D. Mumford, "Social innovation: ten cases from Benjamin Franklin." ''Creativity research journal'' (2002) 14#2 pp. 253–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ed., '' A Companion to Benjamin Franklin'' (2011) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Leo Lemay, ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747'' (2005) pp. 92–94, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:

{{quote|A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library: an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, [[Louis Timothee]]. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and [[Library#Research library|research library]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Barton Korty, "Benjamin Franklin and eighteenth-century American libraries." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1965): 1–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006049 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaperman===
Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with [[Hugh Meredith]]; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

[[File:Franklin the printer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Benjamin Franklin (center) at work on a [[printing press]]. Reproduction of a Charles Mills painting by the [[Detroit Publishing Company]].]]

In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in America – ''Die Philadelphische Zeitung'' – although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa071299.htm|title=German Newspapers in the US and Canada|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin printed Moravian religious books in German. Franklin often visited [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] staying at the [[Moravian Sun Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;John B. Frantz, "Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans." ''Pennsylvania History'' (1998): 21–34. [https://journals.psu.edu/index.php/phj/article/viewFile/25467/25236 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies, he called the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Germans]] "Palatine Boors" who could never acquire the "Complexion" of the English settlers and referred to "Blacks and Tawneys" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Philip. Gleason, "Trouble in the Colonial Melting Pot." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2000) 20#1 pp. 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. In ''Benjamin Franklin's Journalism'', Ralph Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin]]

When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two "wretched little" news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''The American Weekly Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/225/index.html#7 Elizabeth Christine Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt; This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from ''Chambers's Universal Dictionary''. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor'' and made it ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''. The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. {{anchor|The Busy-Body}}{{anchor|The Busybody}}The series of essays called "The Busy-Body", which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general [[Joseph Addison|Addisonian]] form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been in the ''Tatler''. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, [[Samuel Keimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette.'' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, ''Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0826216144}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1731. After the second editor died, his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738–46. She was one of the colonial era's first woman printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Ira L. | year = 1977 | title = Elizabeth Timothy: America's First Woman Editor | url = | journal = Journalism Quarterly | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 280–85 | doi=10.1177/107769907705400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "'The Partnership at Carolina Having succeeded, was Encourag'd to Engage in Others': The Genesis of Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network", ''Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South'' (2006), Vol. 13 Issue 1/2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeffery A. | year = 1993 | title = Impartiality and Revolutionary Ideology: Editorial Policies of the 'South-Carolina Gazette,' 1732–1735 | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 511–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franklin's ''Connecticut Gazette'' (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 2003 | title = 'I am now about to establish a small Printing Office&amp;nbsp;... at Newhaven': Benjamin Franklin and the First Newspaper in Connecticut | url = | journal = Connecticut History | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 77–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
In 1730 or 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local [[Masonic lodge]]. He became a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freemasonry&gt;{{cite web| url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/franklin_b/franklin_b.html|title=Freemasonry Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]]'s ''[[Constitutions of the Free-Masons]]''.

===Common-law marriage to Deborah Read===
{{double image|right|Deborah ReadFranklin.jpg|160|Sarah Franklin Bache1793.jpg|160|[[Deborah Read|Deborah Read Franklin]]&lt;br /&gt;(c. 1759). Common-law wife of Benjamin Franklin|[[Sarah Franklin Bache]] (1743–1808). Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read}}

At age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old [[Deborah Read]] while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith's]] request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]] with her [[dowry]], leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of [[bigamy]] laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.

Franklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730. They took in Franklin's recently acknowledged young illegitimate son [[William Franklin|William]] and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, [[Francis Folger Franklin]], was born in October 1732 and died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. Their daughter, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah "Sally" Franklin]], was born in 1743 and grew up to marry [[Richard Bache]], have seven children, and look after her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, and another possible reason why they spent so much time apart is that he may have blamed her for preventing their son Francis from being vaccinated against the disease that subsequently killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Coss, Stephen. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/benjamin-franklin-estranged-wife-nearly-two-decades-180964400/ "What Led Benjamin Franklin to Live Estranged From His Wife for Nearly Two Decades?"], ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' (September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah wrote to him in November 1769 saying she was ill due to "dissatisfied distress" from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done.&lt;ref&gt;November 1769 [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a Letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615055537/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a |date=June 15, 2018 }} from Deborah Read to Ben Franklin, ''franklinpapers.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to England; he returned in 1775.

===William Franklin===
{{see also|William Franklin}}
[[File:WilliamFranklin.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[William Franklin]]]]

In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged the existence of his son William, who was deemed "illegitimate," as he was born out of wedlock, and raised him in his household. His mother's identity is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Skemp SL. ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0195057457}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Philadelphia. Beginning at about age 30, William studied law in London in the early 1760s. He fathered an illegitimate son, [[William Temple Franklin]], born February 22, 1762. The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. Later in 1762, William married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a [[plantation|planter]] from [[Barbados]]. After William passed the bar, his father helped him gain an appointment in 1763 as the last [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|Royal Governor]] of New Jersey.

A [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], William and his father eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War. The elder Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in [[Perth Amboy]] at the [[Proprietary House]] and imprisoned for a time. The younger Franklin went to New York in 1782, which was still occupied by British troops. He became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists—a quasi-military organization, headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into [[New Jersey]], southern [[Connecticut]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] counties north of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Thomas, ''The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival'', (Collins, New York, 2007) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England. He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, "...&amp;nbsp;Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success as an author===
[[File:The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle Vol 1, January, 1741.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle'' (Jan. 1741)]]

In 1733, Franklin began to publish the noted ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as "A penny saved is twopence dear" (often misquoted as "A penny saved is a penny earned") and "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution.{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=109}} In 1741 Franklin began publishing ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America'', the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.

In 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed ''Father Abraham's Sermon'', also known as ''[[The Way to Wealth]]''. Franklin's [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], begun in 1771 but published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.

[[Daylight saving time]] (DST) is often erroneously attributed to a 1784 satire that Franklin published [[anonymity|anonymously]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Inventions and scientific inquiries==
{{Further|Social contributions and studies by Benjamin Franklin}}
Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the [[lightning rod]], [[glass harmonica]] (a glass instrument, not to be confused with the [[Harmonica|metal harmonica]]), [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals|bifocal glasses]] and the flexible [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]]. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] he wrote, "...&amp;nbsp;as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Electricity===

Franklin started exploring the phenomenon of [[electricity]] in 1746 when he saw some of [[Archibald Spencer]]'s lectures using static electricity for illustrations.&lt;ref name=EncyColonial&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/science-and-medicine |title= Science and Medicine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= Colonial America Reference Library |publisher= Encyclopedia.com |access-date=February 27, 2017 |quote= Franklin's interest in electricity originated when he saw a traveling scientific lecturer, Archibald Spencer, perform an "electricity show" in Boston, Massachusetts. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity were not different types of "[[Aether theories|electrical fluid]]" (as electricity was called then), but the same "fluid" under different pressures. (The same proposal was made independently that same year by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]].) Franklin was the first to label them as [[electric charge|positive and negative]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|date=May 25, 1747|title=Letter to Peter Collinson|journal=Franklin Papers|url=http://franklinpapers.org/franklin//framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=126b|accessdate=May 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020014725/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin//framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=126b|archive-date=October 20, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html "Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790)"], ''Science World'', from Eric Weisstein's ''World of Scientific Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to discover the principle of [[charge conservation|conservation of charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm |title=Conservation of Charge |accessdate=2006-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218104547/http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}.

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]] in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected as a Fellow of the Society. He received honorary degrees from [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] universities (his first).{{sfn|Va Doren|1938|p=168}} The [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] unit of electric charge has been named after him: one ''franklin'' (Fr) is equal to one [[statcoulomb]].

Franklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire which destroyed the original [[Harvard Hall]] in 1764. The collection he assembled would later become part of the [[Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments]], now on public display in its [[Harvard Science Center|Science Center]].&lt;ref name="Tomase"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomase|first1=Jennifer|title='A How-To Guide' explores Ben Franklin's 'can-do' legacy|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/06.01/10-franklin.html|accessdate=2016-08-09|work=Harvard University Gazette|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin briefly investigated [[electrotherapy]], including the use of the [[electric bath (electrotherapy)|electric bath]].  This work led to the field becoming widely known.&lt;ref&gt;* Schiffer, Michael B, ''Draw the Lightning Down: Benjamin Franklin and Electrical Technology in the Age of Enlightenment'', pp. 136-137, 301, University of California Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0520248295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kite experiment and lightning rod====
{{main|Kite experiment}}
[[File:BEP-JONES-Franklin and Electricity.jpg|thumb|left|''Franklin and Electricity'' vignette [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraved]] by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] (c. 1860)]]

In 1750,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that [[lightning]] is electricity by [[Kite experiment|flying a kite in a storm]] that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment [[St. Stephen's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia)|in Philadelphia]], successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. Franklin described the experiment in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' on October 19, 1752,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a "The Kite Experiment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102183234/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a |date=November 2, 2017 }}, printed in ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', October 19, 1752.

Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Priestley]] published an account with additional details in his 1767 ''History and Present Status of Electricity''. Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of [[electric shock]].{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=159}} Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] in [[Russia]], were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following Franklin's experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. Franklin did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''], Museum of Science, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leyden jar]], may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''. New York, 1939. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the [[lightning rod]]. He said that conductors with a sharp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/lightning-rods-franklin-had-it-wrong.html |title=''Lightning Rods: Franklin Had It Wrong'' |accessdate=2018-03-16 |work=New York Times |date=1983-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching "upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;&amp;nbsp;... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=''Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods'' |volume=59 |page=42 |author=Krider, Philip |journal=Physics Today |date=January 2006|doi=10.1063/1.2180176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population studies===
Franklin had a major influence on the emerging science of [[demography]], or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dr. Alan Houston| title=Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMN9VEhrTxwC&amp;pg=PA106| year=2008| publisher=Yale U.P.| pages=106–41| isbn=978-0300152395}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] is noted for his rule of population growth and credited Franklin for discovering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=I.

Norton| page=87| isbn=978-0393057690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kammen (1990) and Drake (2011) say Franklin's "[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.|Observations on the Increase of Mankind]]" (1755) stands alongside [[Ezra Stiles]]' "Discourse on Christian Union" (1760) as the leading works of eighteenth-century Anglo-American demography; Drake credits Franklin's "wide readership and prophetic insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=James David Drake| title=The Nation's Nature: How Continental Presumptions Gave Rise to the United States of America| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWV9T2MT5SoC&amp;pg=PA63| year=2011| publisher=U. of Virginia Press| page=63| isbn=978-0813931227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael G.

In the 1730s and 1740s, Franklin began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rate on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=J. A. Leo Lemay| title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 3: Soldier, Scientist, and Politician, 1748–1757| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NL5bcRP5aRAC&amp;pg=PA245| year=2008| publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press| page=245| isbn=978-0812241211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies—a line of thought later developed by [[Thomas Malthus]]—Franklin emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every twenty years and would surpass that of England in a century.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he drafted "Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c." Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston, and it was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economist [[Adam Smith]] and later the demographer [[Thomas Malthus]]. Franklin's predictions alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen Aldridge | first1 = Alfred | year = 1949 | title = Franklin as Demographer | journal = Journal of Economic History | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–44 | jstor=2113719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=George William Van Cleve| title=A Slaveholders' Union: Slavery, Politics, and the Constitution in the Early American Republic| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dgp26Y2KzxUC&amp;pg=PA148| year= 2010| publisher=U. of Chicago Press| page=148| isbn=978-0226846699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic Ocean currents===
As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]]? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall.

Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a [[Nantucket]] whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0}}. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the [[Gulf Stream]], by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole oceanographer]] and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Philip L. Richardson (February 8, 1980), "Benjamin Franklin and Timothy Folger's first printed chart of the Gulf Stream", ''Science'', vol. 207, no. 4431, pp. 643–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/How_Franklin_s_chart_resurfaced.html "How Franklin's chart resurfaced"], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', posted December 18, 2005, accessed November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This find received front-page coverage in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Wilford, "Prints of Franklin's chart of Gulf Stream found", ''New York Times'' (N.Y., N.Y.), pp. A1, B7 (February 6, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;1785: Benjamin Franklin's "Sundry Maritime Observations,"
 The Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1939&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html ''1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' ''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |date=October 2, 2008 }} NOAA Ocean Explorer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:

{{quote|Though it was Dr. Franklin and Captain Tim Folger, who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them, for its existence was known to [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], and to [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]], in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts'', 1853, p. 53, by [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wave theory of light===
Franklin was, along with his contemporary [[Leonhard Euler]], the only major scientist who supported [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s [[wave theory of light]], which was basically ignored by the rest of the [[scientific community]]. In the 18th century [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] was held to be true; only after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] well-known [[slit experiment]] in 1803 were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Jogn Gribbin, "In search of Schrödinger's cat", Black Swan, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteorology===
On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2003/alm03oct.htm ''Eclipsed By Storm''.] The Weather Doctor. October 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of [[Laki]] in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations connecting the causal nature of these two separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~volcano/Fr373p77.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traction kiting===
Though Benjamin Franklin has been most noted kite-wise with his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for his using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34193/34193-h/34193-h.htm| title= The True Benjamin Franklin| first= Sydney George| last= Fisher| year=1903 |publisher=J. B. Lippincott Company| location=Philadelphia| edition=5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Pocock (inventor)|George Pocock]] in the book ''A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMo-DVp_ypUC| title= A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails| first=George| last=Pocock| page=9| publisher=Longmans, Brown, and Co.| location=London| year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin's traction of his body by kite power across a waterway. In his later years he suggested using the technique for pulling ships.

===Concept of cooling===
Franklin noted a principle of [[refrigeration]] by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, Franklin and fellow scientist [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]] experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |title=The Writings of Benjamin Franklin: London, 1757–1775 |publisher=Historycarper.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching {{convert|7|F}}. Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at {{convert|65|F}}. In his letter ''[[Cooling by Evaporation]]'', Franklin noted that, "One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."

===Temperature's effect on electrical conductivity===
According to [[Michael Faraday]], Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |title=Experimental researches in electricity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=non-conduction+of+ice#v=onepage&amp;q=non-conduction%20of%20ice |page=v |volume=2 |year=1839 |publisher=R. &amp; J.E. Taylor |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, "...&amp;nbsp;A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct&amp;nbsp;..." and again, "...&amp;nbsp;And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Thomas P. |title=Journal of the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zV9DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=Thomas+P.+Jones+1836+Journal+of+the+Franklin+Institute+vol.xvii |pages=182–83 |year=1836 |quote=In the fourth series of his electrical researches, Mr. Faraday&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanography findings===

===Decision-making===
In a 1772 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Franklin lays out the earliest known description of the Pro &amp; Con list,&lt;ref name="decisions"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |year=1975 |origyear=1772 |chapter=To Joseph Priestley |editor-last=Willcox |editor-first=William Bradford |title=The papers of Benjamin Franklin: January 1 through December 31, 1772 |volume=19 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=299–300 |isbn=978-0300018653 |oclc=310601 |chapterurl=http://franklinpapers.org/yale?vol=19&amp;page=299a |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common [[decision-making]] technique, now sometimes called a [[decisional balance sheet]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one ''Pro'', and over the other ''Con''. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason ''pro'' equal to some two Reasons ''con'', I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons ''con'' equal to some three Reasons ''pro'', I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.&lt;ref name="decisions" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oil on water===
While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship [[storm oil|was diminished]] when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in [[Clapham Common]], London. "I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water&amp;nbsp;... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square." He later used the trick to "calm the waters" by carrying "a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane".&lt;ref&gt;*W. Gratzer, Eurekas and Euphorias, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin is known to have played the violin, the [[harp]], and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a [[string quartet]] in [[classical period (music)|early classical style]]. While he was in London, he developed a much-improved version of the [[glass harmonica]], in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around. He worked with the London glassblower Charles James to create it, and instruments based on his mechanical version soon found their way to other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Thomas.

==Chess==
Franklin was an avid [[chess]] player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"&gt;John McCrary, [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin-His Pioneering Contributions''] ([[PDF]]).

Retrieved December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He and a friend also used chess as a means of learning the [[Italian language]], which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Temple Franklin]], ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', reprinted in Knight, ''Chess Pieces'', pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended [[Old Slaughter's Coffee House]] in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous [[Café de la Régence]], which France's strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Chess in Fifty Moves'', by Bill Price, Firefly Books (U.S.) Inc., Buffalo, New York, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1770855298}}, pp. 90–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was inducted into the [[World Chess Hall of Fame|U.S. Chess Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"/&gt; The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.

==Public life==

===Early steps in Pennsylvania===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]).]]

In 1736, Franklin created the [[Union Fire Company]], one of the first [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighting companies]] in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for [[Banknote|paper money]], publishing ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped [[deflation]] without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. (1975). ''Money: Where It Came, Whence It Went'', pp. 54–54. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|The Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia]]. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]], refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749, when he printed his own pamphlet, ''Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.''&lt;ref name="MontgomeryHistory"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.D. 1770 | publisher=George W. Jacobs &amp; Co. | author=Montgomery, Thomas Harrison | year=1900 | location=Philadelphia | lccn=00003240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the Academy and the Charity School opened on August 13, 1751.

In 1743, Franklin founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Green, "English Books and Printing in the Age of Franklin", in ''The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World'' (2002), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a partnership with his foreman, [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]], which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France.

[[File:PennsylvaniaHospitalWilliamStrickland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Pennsylvania Hospital]] by [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], 1755]]

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]]. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed deputy postmaster-general of [[British North America]], ([[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|see below]]). His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1751, Franklin and [[Thomas Bond (physician)|Dr. Thomas Bond]] obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.

In 1752, Franklin organized the [[Philadelphia Contributionship]], the first [[homeowner's insurance]] company in what would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=In the Early 19th Century, Firefighters Fought Fires ... and Each Other|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/early-19-century-firefighters-fought-fires-each-other-180960391/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|date=September 27, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Virginia|title=What Are Those Little Shields Above the Doorways of Philadelphia Homes?|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2013/05/03/the-storied-fire-marks-of-philadelphia/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]|publisher=[[Metrocorp]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1757 UPenn Seal.png|thumb|upright|Seal of the College of Philadelphia]]

Between 1750 and 1753, the "educational triumvirate"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}}, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] of [[Stratford, Connecticut]], and the immigrant Scottish schoolteacher [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|Dr. William Smith]] built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what [[James Madison (bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], president of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], called a "new-model"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Horace Wemyss, ''The Life and Correspondence of the Rev. Wm. Smith, D.D.'', Philadelphia, 1880, Volume 1: pp. 566–67.&lt;/ref&gt; plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of [[ethics|moral philosophy]] from the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] titled ''Elementa Philosophica''&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Elementa philosophica: containing chiefly, Noetica, or things relating to the mind or understanding: and Ethica, or things relating to the moral behaviour. Philadelphia'', Printed by B. Franklin and D. Hall, at the new-printing-office, near the market, 1752&lt;/ref&gt; to be taught in the new colleges to replace courses in denominational divinity.

In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, pp. 163–274&lt;/ref&gt; They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson went on to found King's College (now [[Columbia University]]) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as Provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and one as [[Master of Arts]]. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The College was to become influential in guiding [[:Template:Founding Documents of America|the founding documents of the United States]]: in the [[Continental Congress]], for example, over one third of the college-affiliated men who contributed the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the College.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1753, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/honorary-degrees Honorary Degrees] Harvard University.

[[File:Sketch of Tun Tavern in the Revolutionary War.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the original [[Tun Tavern]]]]

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the [[Albany Congress]]. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad [[Albany Plan|Plan of Union]] for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

In 1756, Franklin received an honorary [[master of arts]] degree from the [[College of William and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=College of William and Mary |first=College of William and Mary |date=1874 |title=The History of the College of William and Mary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfaiLj00yFYC&amp;pg=PA48 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=J. W. Randolph &amp; English |page=148|isbn=9781429043335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see "Associated Regiment of Philadelphia" under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and [[111th Infantry Regiment (United States)|111th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Continental Army]]). He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected "Colonel" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.

===Decades in London===
From the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London. Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people.

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the [[Penn family]], the [[proprietary colony|proprietors of the colony]]. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission.

[[File:US-Colonial (PA-115)-Pennsylvania-18 Jun 1764.jpg|thumb|left|Pennsylvania colonial currency printed by Franklin in 1764]]

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;J. A. Leo Lematy, "Franklin, Benjamin". ''[[American National Biography]] Online'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]]. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Charles Hoffer, ''Benjamin Franklin Explains the Stamp Act Protests to Parliament, 1766'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin in London, 1767, wearing a blue suit with elaborate gold braid and buttons, a far cry from the simple dress he affected at the [[Court (royal)|French court]] in later years. Painting by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], displayed in the [[White House]].]]

With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

Franklin lodged in a house in Craven Street, just off [[Strand, London|The Strand]] in [[central London]]. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum in 2006.

Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a [[gentleman's club]] (which he called "the honest Whigs"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]], and [[Andrew Kippis]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Wu, ''William Hazlitt (1737-1820), the Priestley Circle, and "The Theological Repository:" A Brief Survey and Bibliography'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (Nov., 2005), pp. 758–766, at p. 762. Published by: Oxford University Press {{jstor|3661246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|Covent Garden coffee shops]]. After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

The study of [[natural philosophy]] (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]; on occasion he visited them.

In 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded Franklin an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in recognition of his accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/people-franklin-resume.htm|title=Benjamin Franklin's Resume – Independence National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Oxford University]] in 1762. Because of these honors, Franklin was often addressed as "Dr. Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benjamin-Franklin|title=Benjamin Franklin – American author, scientist, and statesman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also managed to secure an appointed post for his illegitimate son, [[William Franklin]], by then an attorney, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While living in London in 1768, [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|he developed a phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. This alphabet never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet''.] Omniglot.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travels around Britain and Ireland===
Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with [[Joseph Priestley]] at [[Leeds]], [[Thomas Percival]] at [[Manchester]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] at [[Lichfield]].&lt;ref name="sparks"&gt;Sparks, Jared. [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/chap05.htm ''Life of Benjamin Franklin''.] US History.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, he spent five days with [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]] near [[Stirling]] and stayed for three weeks with [[David Hume]] in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited [[Edinburgh]] with his son, and recalled his conversations there as "the ''densest'' happiness of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. ''Crowded with Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2003. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. From then he was known as "Doctor Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaustad|first=Edwin S|title=Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrnUhKvBumAC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=May 1, 2016|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|isbn=978-0199709366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year he was granted [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of [[St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx#19 |title=The Kate Kennedy Club |publisher=The Kate Kennedy Club |accessdate=September 21, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327111941/http://katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx |archivedate= March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had never been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who he believed was especially attentive. Franklin noted of him that "all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=BL1VXdTbDucC&amp;pg=PR21 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin  |editor=Nathan Haskell Dole |year=  2003|accessdate=September 21, 2009|isbn=978-0766143753}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dublin]], Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.&lt;ref name="sparks" /&gt; While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain's "colonial exploitation" continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_worldly_ireland.html ''Benjamin Franklin''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visits to Europe===
Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Prussia–United States)|treaty of friendship]] between Prussia and America in 1785.

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]]. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].&lt;ref name="isaacson"&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life''. Simon &amp; Schuster. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defending the American cause===
One line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the [[French and Indian War]], and that therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James A.

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: [[s:Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One|"Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One"]], and "An Edict by the King of Prussia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| title=reprinted on The History Carper| last=Franklin| first=Benjamin| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103051246/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| archivedate=January 3, 2006| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hutchinson letters leak===
{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}
In 1772, Franklin obtained private letters of [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and [[Andrew Oliver]], governor and lieutenant governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], proving that they had encouraged the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America, where they escalated the tensions. The letters were finally [[News leak|leaked]] to the public in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' in mid-June 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailyn|first=Bernard|title=The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1974|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674641600|oclc=6825524}}, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.&lt;ref name=Penegar29&gt;{{cite book|last=Penegar|first=Kenneth|title=The Political Trial of Benjamin Franklin|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0875868493|location=New York|oclc=696296728}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]], before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila L. Skemp, ''The Making of a Patriot: Benjamin Franklin at the Cockpit'' (Oxford University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coming of revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The [[Paxton Boys]], a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] raids, murdered a group of peaceful [[Susquehannock]] Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local [[militia]] to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the [[racism|racial prejudice]] of the Paxton Boys. "If an ''Indian'' injures me", he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all ''Indians''?"&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm "A Narrative of the Late Massacres&amp;nbsp;..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427070508/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }} reprinted on The History Carper.&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of [[Surveillance art|counter-surveillance and manipulation]]. "He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Crews| first= Ed| title= Spies and Scouts, Secret Writing, and Sympathetic Citizens| journal= Colonial Williamsburg Journal| url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/Summer04/spies.cfm| date= Summer 2004| accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the [[American Revolution]] had begun—with fighting between colonials and British at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by [[gout]] and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several "small but important"&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 311–12&lt;/ref&gt; changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by [[John Hancock]] that they must all hang together: "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Postmaster===
&lt;!--The 'Franklin on US Postage' section links to this section/image file. --&gt;
[[File:Franklin SC1 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|First issue of Benjamin Franklin on US [[Benjamin Franklin#Franklin on U.S. Postage|postage stamp]], issue of 1847]]

Well known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher [[William Hunter (publisher)|William Hunter]] were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. ([[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom#Two Postmasters General|Joint appointments]] were standard at the time, for political reasons.) Franklin was responsible for the British colonies from Pennsylvania north and east, as far as the [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]]. A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in what would later become Canada, at Halifax, on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] and oversaw areas south of [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/ch1753ae.shtml "1753 Benjamin Franklin"], Stéphanie Ouellet, in A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lands of [[New France]] were ceded to the British under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the new British [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|province of Quebec]] was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec City]], and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, Franklin lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774)—about three-quarters of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/chs1760e.shtml#yr-1774 "1760–1840 Planting the Imperial Postal System in British North America"], A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.

On July 26, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] established the [[United States Postal Service|United States Post Office]] and named Benjamin Franklin as the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson. ''Benjamin Franklin: an American life'', pp. 206–09, 301&lt;/ref&gt; He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blmailus1.htm#CONGRESS |title=History of the United States Postal Systems |publisher=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Friedrich Christoph Schlosser]] remarked at the time, with ample hyperbole, that "Such was the number of portraits, busts and medallions of him in circulation before he left Paris, that he would have been recognized from them by any adult citizen in any part of the civilized world."&amp;nbsp;– {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Franklin, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as [[commissioner]] for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/ead/upenn_rbml_MsColl900 Benjamin Franklin papers], [http://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak/ Kislak Center for Special Collections], Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, [[William Temple Franklin]]. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of [[Passy]], donated by [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]], who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].

Among his associates in France was [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]]—a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in early 1791 would be elected president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin The Book in the Painting: De la Caisse d'Escompte]." [http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin isthisjefferson.org] Accessed February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_39568#page/n3/mode/2up  ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''], December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was critical of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a "noble order", inconsistent with the [[egalitarian]] ideals of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin'' (The Viking Press: New York). 1938. pp. 709–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin was active as a [[freemasonry|Freemason]], serving as Venerable Master of the Lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]] from 1779 until 1781. He was the 106th member of the Lodge. In 1784, when [[Franz Mesmer]] began to publicize his theory of "[[animal magnetism]]" which was considered offensive by many, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephan A.

[[File:Libertas Americana silver medallion 1783.jpg|thumb|While in France Franklin designed and commissioned [[Augustin Dupré]] to engrave the medallion ''"Libertas Americana"'' minted in Paris in 1783.]]

Franklin's advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]] in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html "Edict of Versailles (1787)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=July 14, 2012 }}, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals'', downloaded January 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He negotiated a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Sweden)|treaty]] that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, Franklin witnessed the world's first hydrogen [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight.&lt;ref name="EcceF"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5_7IRHZGyzMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22jacques+charles%22+%22Eccentric+France%22&amp;q=%22jacques%20charles%22%20%22Eccentric%20France%22 |title=Eccentric France: Bradt Guide to mad, magical and marvellous France| author=Piers Letcher&amp;nbsp;– Jacques Charles |year= 2003|accessdate=March 17, 2010| isbn=978-1841620688}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert brothers#First hydrogen balloon|Le Globe]]'', created by professor [[Jacques Charles]] and [[Robert brothers|Les Frères Robert]], was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the [[Champ de Mars]] (now the site of the [[Eiffel Tower]]).&lt;ref name="Sci&amp;Soc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10447673 |title=Science and Society, Medal commemorating Charles and Robert's balloon ascent, Paris, 1783 |publisher=Scienceandsociety.co.uk |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin became so enthusiastic that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon.&lt;ref name="Fid Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fiddlersgreen.net/models/Aircraft/Balloon-Charles.html |title=Fiddlers Green, History of Ballooning, Jacques Charles |publisher=Fiddlersgreen.net |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when ''[[Robert brothers#First manned hydrogen balloon flight|La Charlière]]'' took off from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], piloted by Jacques Charles and [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]].&lt;ref name="EcceF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |title=Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers |publisher=Fai.org |accessdate=March 17, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516222023/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional Convention===
[[File:Franklin's return to Philadelphia 1785 cph.3g09906.jpg|thumb|''Franklin's return to Philadelphia, 1785'', by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]

When he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of [[George Washington]] as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by [[Joseph Duplessis]], which now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_citizen_abolitionist.html ''Citizen Ben, Abolitionist''], PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]).

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

Franklin strongly supported the right to [[freedom of speech]]:

{{quote|In those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can scarce call anything his own. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech&amp;nbsp;...

Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man&amp;nbsp;...|[[Silence Dogood]] no. 8, 1722&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Coffman |editor1-first=Steve |title=Words of the Founding Fathers: Selected Quotations of Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton, with Sources |year=2012 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786458622| page=97| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsFnB7FA11YC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===President of Pennsylvania===
[[File:FRANKLIN, Benjamin (signed check).jpg|thumb|Franklin autograph check signed during his Presidency of Pennsylvania]]

Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected Franklin the sixth [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|president]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], replacing [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. The office was practically that of [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|governor]]. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''The First American'', pp. 654–55, 694&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtue, religion, and personal beliefs==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) MET DT2883.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Franklin by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]]]

Like the other advocates of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in ''Poor Richard's'' [[aphorism]]s. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Autobiography'', ed. Lemay, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Franklin met [[Voltaire]] in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, "God and Liberty", and added, "this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro Américo - Voltaire abençoando o neto de Franklin em nome de Deus e da Liberdade.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Voltaire blessing Franklin's grandson, in the name of God and Liberty'', by [[Pedro Américo]]]]

Franklin's parents were both pious [[Puritan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;5–18&lt;/ref&gt; The family attended the [[Old South Church]], the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Old South Church |url=http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |title=Isaacson, 2003, p. 15 |publisher=Oldsouth.org |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531090015/http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's father, a poor [[chandlery|chandler]], owned a copy of a book, ''Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good'', by the Puritan preacher and family friend [[Cotton Mather]], which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life.&lt;ref&gt;"If I have been", Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather's son seventy years later, "a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book." in Isaacson, 2003, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Franklin| first = Benjamin| title = Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion| work = Benjamin Franklin Papers| publisher = franklinpapers.org| date = November 20, 1728| url = http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| accessdate = December 24, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104638/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| archive-date = July 26, 2011| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the [[divinity of Jesus]], or indeed much religious dogma.

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers]]
It was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.&amp;nbsp;... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:&amp;nbsp;... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Michael E.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Rossiter|Rossiter, Clinton]]. 1787. ''The Grand Convention'' (1966), pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister [[George Whitefield]] during the [[First Great Awakening]]. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 107–13&lt;/ref&gt;

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Franklin Benjamin [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm "Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905094326/http://ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm |date=September 5, 2008 }} Section 2 reprinted on UShistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111frank2.html |title=Benjamin Franklin |publisher=History.hanover.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a "passion for virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract [[Republicanism in the United States|ideal of republican government]] based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, pp. 273–74, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; "Puritanism&amp;nbsp;... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification"&lt;ref name="Bailyn303" /&gt; by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved.&lt;ref name="Bailyn303"&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma, but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin's commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on "inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 10, 102, 489&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of Franklin's quintessentially American characteristics, and helped shape the character of the nation. Franklin's writings on [[virtue]] were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work ''Portrait of American Culture''. [[Max Weber]] considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and the "Spirit of Capitalism"'', (Penguin Books, 2002), translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Franklin's notable characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|his autobiography]], "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"&gt;Isaacson,2003 pp. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt; The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected "a large, new hall, that&amp;nbsp;... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and [[civic virtue]] made him the "prophet of tolerance."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"/&gt; Franklin composed "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOEjB0Pdq8oC&amp;pg=PA109|title=The Political Thought of Benjamin Franklin|isbn=978-0872206830|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|British Unitarianism]], attending the inaugural session of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], at which [[Theophilus Lindsey]] drew together the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] was illegal until [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813|the 1813 Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall1.shtml |title=Chapter 2, ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D.

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church,&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in [[deism]], that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; "I soon became a thorough Deist."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism, Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion, on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches, man will not be good.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 46, 486&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of his proposal that [[Christian prayer|prayers]] be said in the [[Constitutional Convention of 1787]], many have contended that in his later life Franklin became a [[piety|pious]] Christian.&lt;ref name="Pious"&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry Louis Mencken, George Jean Nathan| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LqJUonES6m8C&amp;q=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion| title=The American Mercury, Volume 8| publisher=Garber Communications| quote=It is well known that in his youth Benjamin Franklin was a thorough-going Deist, but because he proposed that prayers be said in the Constitution Convention of 1787 many have contended that in later life he became a pious Christian.| date=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faith"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ralph Frasca| url=https://books.google.com/?id=CY2UVzcU5l0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+christian+or+deist#v=onepage| title=Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America| publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]| quote=Despite being raised a Puritan of the Congregationalist stripe by his parents, who "brought me through my Childhood piously in the Dissenting Way", Franklin recalled, he abandoned that denomination, briefly embraced deism, and finally became a non-denominational Protestant Christian. |year= 2009| isbn=978-0826264923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, David T. "Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion". ''The Historian''. 62#4 2000. pp. 722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of religion in general. He prayed to "Powerful Goodness" and referred to God as "the infinite". [[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: "The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] thought him half a Presbyterian, and the [[Quakers|Friends]] believed him a wet Quaker." Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, "he was a true champion of generic religion." In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, "When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:

{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble. I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed; especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;}}

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God" and a scene from the [[Book of Exodus]], with [[Moses]], the [[Israelites]], the [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] depicted as [[Pharaohs in the Bible#Pharaoh of the Exodus|pharaoh]]. The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]" (July 2003).

[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2006), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirteen Virtues===
[[File:Franklin bust at Columbia University IMG 0924.JPG|thumb|Franklin bust in the [[Archives]] Department of [[Columbia University]] in New York City]]

Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:

# "[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation."
# "[[Silence]]. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation."
# "[[Order (virtue)|Order]]. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time."
# "Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve."
# "[[Frugality]]. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing."
# "[[Industry]]. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions."
# "[[Sincerity]]. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly."
# "[[Justice]]. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty."
# "[[Moderation]]. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve."
# "[[Cleanliness]]. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation."
# "[[Tranquility]]. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable."
# "[[Chastity]]. Rarely use [[Human sexuality|venery]] but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation."
# "[[Humility]]. Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]]."

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week "leaving all others to their ordinary chance." While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, "I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
Franklin owned as many as seven slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who had run off to join the [[British Army]] during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a "cautious abolitionist" and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. Franklin took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King, and King left his service there in 1756: by 1758 he was working for "a lady in Suffolk".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|chapter = Chapter Eight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Franklin could have compelled King's return is open to doubt in the light of earlier English [[Common Law]] decisions and [[Slavery at common law#Shanley v Harvey|the subsequent case of Shanley v Harvey]], but in fact he did not do so.

After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the [[international slave trade]]. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the [[1787 Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher, David. "Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the Founders: On the dangers of reading backwards." Common-place.org. 04, no. 4 (July 2004). http://common-place.org/book/benjamin-franklin-slavery-and-the-founders-on-the-dangers-of-reading-backwards/&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin tended to take both sides of the issue of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer (2011), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher (2004), pp. xii, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:

* ''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'' (1789)
* ''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789)
* ''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790)&lt;ref&gt;Myra Jehlen, Michael Warner, editors, ''The English Literatures of America, 1500–1800'', Psychology Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAYDAZmrKkgC&amp;pg=PA891 p. 891] 1997, {{ISBN|0415919037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Quakers]] from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the [[Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society]] and its president, Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin for The Pennsylvania Abolition Society to the United States Congress, ''The memorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, the relief of free Negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and the Improvement of the Conditions of the African Race'' (February 3, 1790)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Philly 2010 transit 071.JPG|thumb|The grave of Benjamin Franklin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

Franklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle-aged and later years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly [[gout]], which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the US Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Benjamin Franklin died from [[Pleurisy|pleuritic attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Isaacson| first=Walter| title=Benjamin Franklin: an American life| year=2003| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- nothing is mentioned about pleurisy in the Timeline:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benfranklin300.org/etc_timeline_1.htm|title=Franklin &amp; Marshall College – ''Ben Franklin: A Timeline''|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new &amp; more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-epitaph.html ''Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words''.] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "Benjamin and Deborah Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html ''The Last Will and Testament of Benjamin Franklin''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821230120/http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html |date=August 21, 2009 }} The Franklin Institute Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1928, it has adorned American [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]], which are sometimes referred to in slang as "Benjamins" or "Franklins." From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the [[Franklin half dollar|half dollar]]. He has appeared on a [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE [[Treasury security#Savings bond|Savings bond]]. Philadelphia's [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] (a major thoroughfare) and [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Benjamin Franklin, was first marked with a [[blue plaque]] and has since been opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin House |publisher=Benjamin Franklin House. |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217063307/http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |archive-date=February 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. ''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf ''The Craven Street Gazette''] ([[PDF]]), Newsletter of the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin [[bequest|bequeathed]] £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $112,000 in 2011 dollars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php Measuring Worth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080025/http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php |date=May 23, 2013 }} Select $4,400 and 1790 and 2011 in online calculator&lt;/ref&gt;) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanack" called "Fortunate Richard". The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price. ''Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution, and the Means of Making it a Benefit to the World. To which is added, a Letter from M. Turgot, late Comptroller-General of the Finances of France: with an Appendix, containing a Translation of the Will of M. Fortuné Ricard, lately published in France.'' London: T. Cadell, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a [[Vocational school|trade school]] that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]], and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |title=Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon |publisher=Mathsci.appstate.edu |date=February 7, 1993 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510050913/http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php |title=History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology |publisher=Bfit.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franklin on U.S. postage===

[[File:Benjamin Franklin2 1895 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1895&lt;/center&gt;]]
Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other notable American save that of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Scotts"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp [[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|(displayed above)]] issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923 the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the [[Washington-Franklin Issues]] where, along with George Washington, Franklin was depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few [[:File:Ben Franklin 250th 1956 issue-3c.jpg|commemorative stamps]]. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;{{clear}}[[File:Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue.jpg|alt=Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue|thumb|center|upright=1.6|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1918&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Bawdy Ben===
"[[Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress]]" is a letter written by Benjamin Franklin, dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers during the nineteenth century. Federal court decisions from the mid-to-late twentieth century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws, using it to make a case against censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Japikse, ed.|title=Fart Proudly: Writings of Benjamin Franklin You Never Read in School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8I3bAlV25kC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2003|publisher=Frog Books|page=8|isbn=978-1583940792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===

"The Princess and the Patriot: [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Dashkova]], Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment" exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75, and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society; she was the only woman so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

===Places and things named after Benjamin Franklin===
{{Further|List of places named for Benjamin Franklin}}
&lt;!-- This list is not intended to be comprehensive. To prevent this list from becoming too long, please consider adding additional places named for Franklin to the separate article titled "List of places named for Benjamin Franklin" as noted at the top of this section --&gt;

As a founding father of the United States, Franklin's name has been attached to many things. Among these are:
* The [[State of Franklin]], a short-lived independent state formed during the American Revolutionary War
* [[County (United States)|Counties]] in at least 16 U.S. states
* The [[Franklin Institute Awards]] (presented by the [[Franklin Institute]]) for significant contributions in the fields of science and engineering.
* Several major landmarks in and around [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, Franklin's longtime home, including:
** [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in nearby [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]
** [[Franklin Field]], a [[American football|football]] field once home to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] and the home field of the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania Quakers]] since 1895
** The [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] across the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia and [[Camden, New Jersey]]
* Several [[US Navy]] ships have been named the {{USS|Franklin}} or the {{USS|Bonhomme Richard}}, the latter being a French translation of his penname "Poor Richard". Two aircraft carriers, {{USS|Franklin|CV-13}} and {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31}}, were simultaneously in commission and in operation during World War II, and Franklin therefore had the distinction of having two simultaneously operational US Navy warships named in his honor. The [[French ship Franklin (1797)|French ship ''Franklin'' (1797)]] was also named in Franklin's honor.
* [[CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin|CMA CGM ''Benjamin Franklin'']], a Chinese-built French owned [[Explorer-class container ship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/31/news/economy/china-container/index.html|title=This is the biggest container ship ever to dock in the U.S.|first1=Rebecca|last1=Wright|first2=Matt|last2=Rivers|date=January 31, 2016|work=[[CNNMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of '''books on British railway accidents''' which provide aid in the systematic study of the causes and effects of accidents, and their prevention.  There are common themes in many accidents (see [[Classification of railway accidents|Classification]]). Key books are listed here to avoid repeating them for each individual accident.

The [[doyen]] is [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s ''Red for Danger'', first published in 1956, which takes a wide-ranging overview of over 100 accidents.  Most other books concentrate on a smaller number of specific accidents, described in more detail.  O.S. Nock's "Historic Railway Disasters" combines both approaches, with individual chapters on especially significant accidents such as [[Armagh rail disaster|Armagh]] and [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]].  For accidents in the last 30 years and modern operating practice, Stanley Hall's four books are particularly good.  Apart from Schneider and Mase (1968/1970) and Faith (2001), all the books below are confined to British accidents.

The list below does not include books on individual accidents; for these, see [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge]], [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]], [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash|Harrow]], [[Hixon rail crash|Hixon]], [[Moorgate tube crash|Moorgate]] and [[Lockington rail crash|Lockington]].

An extremely valuable source now on the Internet is the Railways Archive compilation of official Railway Inspectorate Accident Reports - see "External Links" below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12949">The '''Cartmel Masterplan''' is a fan name for the planned ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[backstory]] developed primarily by [[Andrew Cartmel]], [[Ben Aaronovitch]] and [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], by which they intended to restore some of the mystery of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor's]] background that had been lost through revelation of the existing backstory.&lt;ref name="scriptdoctor"&gt;{{cite book |title=Script Doctor: The Inside Story of ''Doctor Who'' 1986–89 |last=Cartmel |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Cartmel |year=2005 |publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn |location=London |isbn=1-903111-89-7 |pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hints were dropped in the last two seasons, the proposed revelations never materialised on screen as the programme was not renewed for another season in 1990.

Some of the stories during the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s tenure were intended to deal with the lack of mystery by suggesting that much of what was believed about the Doctor was wrong and that he was a far more powerful and mysterious figure than previously thought. In an untelevised scene in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1988), the Doctor stated that he was "far more than just another [[Time Lord]]." In ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' (1988), lines about the creation of [[List of Doctor Who items#Validium|validium]] and Lady Peinforte knowing the Doctor's secrets were meant to point towards this mystery.&lt;ref name="scriptdoctor" /&gt;

The suspension of the series in 1989 meant that none of these hints were ever resolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howe |first=David J |author-link=David J. Howe |last2=Walker |first2=Stephen James |author-link2=Stephen James Walker |last3=Stammers |first3=Mark |date=2005 |title=The Handbook: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Production of Doctor Who |url= |location= |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |page=726 |isbn=1903889596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent production teams after [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|the TV series resumed airing in 2005]] did not directly pick up on these hints either. Despite this, 2010s [[executive producer]] [[Steven Moffat]] acknowledged in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' that the 1989 season "isn't so different" to the "new show" [[Russell T Davies]] and he made after 2005, and felt it was "extraordinary" how close [[Rona Munro]]'s ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]'' (1989) was if you put it next to Davies' "[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]" (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moffat |first=Steven |author-link=Steven Moffat |last2= |first2= |date=August 2015 |title=Steven Moffat |url= |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |volume= |issue=#488 |pages=4 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in a 2014 interview with Cartmel in ''Doctor Who Magazine'', Aaronovitch acknowledged that the style of "today"'s ''Doctor Who'' is "like Rona's stuff", and Cartmel felt that the similarities between ''Remembrance'' and "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" (2013) made ''Remembrance'' "perhaps the closest thing in the twentieth-century series to a dry run" for "The Day of the Doctor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cartmel |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Cartmel |last2= |first2= |date=August 2014 |title=The Cartmel Master Plan Part Two: More Than Just a Time Lord |url= |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |volume= |issue=#475 |pages=29 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Masterplan" was used as a guide for the [[Virgin New Adventures]] series of novels featuring the Seventh Doctor,&lt;ref name="ahistory380"&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin |author2=Lars Pearson |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the revelations about the Doctor's origins were written into the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'' (1997) by Marc Platt. These origins were ignored and even contradicted in subsequent on screen stories.

Cartmel felt that years of explanations about the Doctor's origins and the [[Time Lord]]s had removed much of the mystery and strength of the character of the Doctor, and decided to make the Doctor "once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord".&lt;ref name="scriptdoctor" /&gt; To do this, he built on the established mythology of the Time Lords:{{quote|... [[Omega (Doctor Who)|Omega]] and [[Rassilon]] were the founding fathers of [[Gallifrey]]. They towered above the Time Lords who followed. They were demigods. [Dialogue in ''Silver Nemesis'' was] a subtle attempt to say that there was a third presence there in the shadowy days of Gallifrey's creation. In other words, the Doctor was also there. So he's more than a Time Lord. He's one of these half-glimpsed demigods.&lt;ref name="scriptdoctor" /&gt;}}
More of these hints would have been seen in the story ''Lungbarrow'', which was at one point planned for the programme's 1988–89 series. ''Lungbarrow'' would have been set in the Doctor's ancestral home on Gallifrey, but the story was abandoned; elements were adapted into the broadcast story ''[[Ghost Light (Doctor Who)|Ghost Light]]'' (1989), but none of the Time Lord backstory survived the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Script Doctor: The Inside Story of ''Doctor Who'' 1986–89 |last=Cartmel |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Cartmel |year=2005 |publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn |location=London |isbn=1-903111-89-7 |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, author [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]] eventually adapted his ideas for ''Lungbarrow'' (along with other elements of the "Masterplan"){{vague|date=August 2015}}{{clarify|date=August 2015}} into a ''Doctor Who'' [[Lungbarrow|novel]] for the [[Virgin New Adventures]] series.

In 2014, Cartmel speculated that the "great secret" Lady Peinforte knew about the Doctor in ''Silver Nemesis'' was "perhaps" connected to his name, which during the siege on the Fields of Trenzalore in "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013) is said to be what would allow the Time Lords to return to the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cartmel |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Cartmel |last2= |first2= |date=August 2014 |location=Tunbridge Wells |title=The Cartmel Master Plan Part Two: More Than Just a Time Lord |url= |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |volume= |issue=#475 |pages=33 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Other (Doctor Who)|Other]] was first mentioned explicitly in the novelisation of ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' (1990) by Ben Aaronovitch as a shadowy figure in Time Lord history, one of the founding Triumvirate of Time Lord society after the overthrow of the cult of the Pythia that had, until then, dominated [[Gallifrey]].&lt;ref name="ahistory380" /&gt; The other two members of the Triumvirate were [[Rassilon]] and [[Omega (Doctor Who)|Omega]].

Of the three, the Other's origins are the most obscure, with the circumstances of his birth and appearance being a mystery. Like Rassilon, various contradictory legends surround the Other, some hinting that he had powers surpassing that of Rassilon or Omega, and some even suggesting that he was not born on the Time Lords' home world of [[Gallifrey]]. Even his name is lost to time, which is why he is simply referred to as "the Other". A minor Gallifreyan festival known as Otherstide is celebrated yearly in his honour.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Susan Foreman==
[[Retroactive continuity|Retconning]] the Doctor's backstory was complicated by the existence of [[Susan Foreman]], who was presented in the television series' earliest days as the Doctor's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=An Unearthly Child |title-link=An Unearthly Child |episode=An Unearthly Child |url= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Anthony (writer) |last=Coburn |author-link=Anthony Coburn |first2=Waris (director) |last2=Hussein |author-link2=Waris Hussein |network=[[BBC]] |station= |city= |date=23 November 1963 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote='''Barbara:''' And this is your grandfather?

According to the novel of ''Lungbarrow'', [[Susan Foreman]] was the granddaughter of "[[Other (Doctor Who)|the Other]]", who may have been reincarnated as the Doctor. The Doctor, in his [[First Doctor|first incarnation]], travelled back to the dawn of Time Lord civilisation and rescued a teenaged Susan, who recognised him as her grandfather. The Doctor did not initially recognise her, but knew that this was somehow true.&lt;ref name="ahistorysusan"/&gt; This version of Susan's origins is reflected in many ''Doctor Who'' spin-offs,{{vague|date=August 2015}}{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} but not in the TV series under head writer and [[executive producer]] [[Steven Moffat]]. In "[[The Rings of Akhaten]]" (2013), the [[Eleventh Doctor]] mentions that he travelled to the rings of the planet Akhaten "a long time ago with my granddaughter",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Rings of Akhaten |episode-link=The Rings of Akhaten |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Neil (writer) |last=Cross |author-link=Neil Cross |first2=Farren (director) |last2=Blackburn |author-link2=Farren Blackburn |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=6 April 2013 |season= |series-no=7 |number=7 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in "[[Death in Heaven]]" (2014), written by Moffat, the [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s companion [[Clara Oswald]] refers to the Doctor's missing "children and grandchildren".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Death in Heaven |episode-link=Death in Heaven |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Rachel (director) |last2=Talalay |author-link2=Rachel Talalay |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=8 November 2014 |season= |series-no=8 |number=12 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moffat, answering a question in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' regarding the Doctor's marriages, referred to "some highly inventive material in the Virgin ''New Adventures'' books" that contradicts the ''Doctor Who'' TV series, but thinks this is a "separate (and equally valid) continuity" to the TV series. He also acknowledges that the Doctor "didn't just have children, he had ''grandchildren''", and that "Actually, he had the beginnings of a dynasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moffat |first=Steven |author-link=Steven Moffat |last2= |first2= |date=February 2015 |title=Steven Moffat |url= |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |volume= |issue=#482 |pages=4 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cinematographer''' or '''director of photography''' (sometimes shortened to '''DP''' or '''DOP''') is the chief over the camera and light [[film crew|crew]]s working on a [[film]], television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as [[cinematography]].

The cinematographer selects the camera, [[film stock]], [[photographic lens|lens]]es, [[filter (photography)|filter]]s, etc., to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the [[film director|director]]. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually, and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.

Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the [[Coen brothers]]' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. In 2014, [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan|three ''Batman'' films]], made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''; whilst British cinematographers [[Jack Cardiff]] and [[Freddie Francis]] regularly moved between the two positions.

==History==
[[File:Alex Ferrari.jpg|thumb|A cinematographer on set]]
In the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the [[Film director|director]] and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and [[camera operator]] emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light sensitive) [[film stock]]s, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.

Cinematography was key during the [[silent movie]] era; with no sound apart from [[background music]] and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.

In 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world, one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too.

==Societies and trade organizations==
There are a number of national associations of cinematographers which represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and which are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography. These include:

*the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (A.S.C.)
*the [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] (C.S.C.)
*the [[British Society of Cinematographers]] (B.S.C.)
*the [[Australian Cinematographers Society]] (A.C.S.)
*the [[Cinematographers Guild of Korea]] (C.G.K.)
*the [[Filipino Society of Cinematographers]] (F.S.C.) 
*the [[French Society of Cinematographers]] (A.F.C.)
*the [[Italian Society of Cinematographers]] (A.I.C.) 
*the [[Indian cinematographers|Indian Society of Cinematographers]] (I.S.C.)
*the [[German Society of Cinematographers]] (BVK)
*the [[Netherlands Society of Cinematographers]] (NSC) 
*the [[Spanish Society of Cinematography Works]] (A.E.C)
*the European Federation of Cinematographers / IMAGO
*the Uruguayan Society of Cinematographers (S.C.U)

The A.S.C. defines cinematography as:
:A creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar''', founded in the late 1970s, provides training for dealers in out-of-print, used, and antiquarian books.

==Origins==
The Seminar was the brainchild of Margaret Knox Goggin, on the faculty (and formerly dean) of the School of Librarianship at the [[University of Denver]]. The first session, held at the University in December 1977, was primarily intended for librarians who wished to improve their skills in buying used, out-of-print, and rare books.&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980, p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five registrants heard lectures by Goggin, Jacob L. Chernofsky (Editor and Publisher of [[AB Bookman's Weekly]]), Lee Ash, and Harry U. Mooney (Collection Development Coordinator, [[Denver Public Library]]). The success of the venture encouraged Goggin and Chernofsky to offer an annual seminar beginning in 1979 on the out-of-print and antiquarian book market, "designed to help librarians throughout the country with a working knowledge of the out-of-print and antiquarian book trade and the role of that market in acquisitions procedures and collection development." &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 18, 1980, p. 4664.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50 students attended the 1979 Seminar, which was oriented toward the needs of librarians; nevertheless, "a half dozen booksellers also registered — pointing up the need for such a course for booksellers as well as librarians.” &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980 p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members at the 1979 Seminar included the autograph dealer Mary A. Benjamin, Franklin Gilliam (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco), Edwin V. Glaser (a dealer specializing in rare medical books, based in Sausalito, CA), Katharine Kyes Leab (Editor of ''American Book Prices Current''), Murray S. Martin (Penn State), Bernard M. Rosenthal (a San Francisco-based dealer specializing in early printed books), and Florian Shasky (Stanford University Libraries).

==Early years==
The Seminar became an annual event held in August at the University of Denver under the co-directorship of Goggin and Chernofsky, its title settling down as "A Workshop-Seminar on the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market for Booksellers and Librarians," designed "to meet the needs of acquisitions librarians, those responsible for developing collections, rare book librarians, as well as booksellers and prospective booksellers.".&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' 23 June 1980, pp. 4886-89; July 7, 1980, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminar lecturers varied somewhat from year to year, but a core faculty emerged that included, besides Jake Chernofsky and Margaret Goggin, Michael Ginsberg (an Americana dealer based in Sharon, MA), Ed Glaser, Robert W. Topp (Hermitage Book Shop, Denver), and [[Jake Zeitlin]] (Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, Los Angeles). Other stalwart faculty members were to include Mary Francis Ciletti, Lois Harvey, Jennifer Larson, Jean Parmer, and Richard Weatherford. Though there were always a few librarians in attendance, by the mid-1980s, the typical Seminar student was a used, out-of-print, or rare bookseller (or someone who wished to become one).

==Success==
The Seminar was soon attracting over 100 registrants annually. It ran extra sessions at the University of Florida in March 1988 and March 1994, in addition to the annual sessions in Colorado each August. Its success was chronicled in a series of annual articles by ''AB Bookman's Weekly'''s Associate Editor, Rebecca Myers, often titled with some variant of "Book is a four-letter word."&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquarian Book Seminar Entering Its 2nd Decade," May 29, 1989, pp. 2397-2402; "Antiquarian Book Seminar Launches Second Decade," May 28, 1990; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," June 24, 1991, pp. 2619-24 and May 11, 1992, 1929-32; "Sharing the Fingerspitzengefuehl," May 17, 1993, pp. 2091-94; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," May 16, 1994, pp. 2155-58 and Jan 9, 1995, pp. 9=-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1985, a keynote speaker began the proceedings on Sunday night. Notable keynoters included John Y. Cole (1985; [[Center for the Book]], [[Library of Congress]]); Marcus A. McCorison (1987; Director and Librarian, [[American Antiquarian Society]]); Robert Rosenthal (1989; head of special collections, [[University of Chicago]]); and Louis Weinstein (1999; Heritage Book Shop, Los Angeles). By the late 1980s, the Seminar had established a tradition of asking a different specialist dealer to join the faculty each year: Diane deBlois in 1988 (aGatherin', Wynanskill, NY; printed ephemera); Patterson Smith in 1990 (Montclair, NJ; true crime); John Crichton in 1991 (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco: literature); Priscilla Juvelis in 1996 (Boston; artists' books); and so on.

==Transition Years==
Margaret Knox Goggin stepped down as co-director of the Seminar after the 1994 Gainesville and Colorado Seminars, and the Denver connection weakened. The 1993 Seminar was hosted by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden; in 1995 the Seminar moved to [[Colorado College]], in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] (where it has been, ever since). Chernofsky continued as director, with Jennifer Larson as unnamed co-director; but in the later 1990s his magazine, [[AB Bookman's Weekly]], was faltering, unable to cope with the rise of internet bookselling; ''AB'' ceased publication in 1999, and Chernofsky sold the Seminar to faculty members Michael Ginsberg, Edwin Glaser, Lois Harvey, and Jennifer Larson (later, Daniel De Simone and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. jointly purchased a 1/5 share of the Seminar from the other shareholders). The Seminar was slow to refocus its presentations on what students most wanted to learn: more about researching and pricing used general-interest books; more about selling on eBay and the internet; less about older and more valuable antiquarian books. Attendance declined; by 2004, the average number of participants had fallen to well under 50.

==CABS Becomes a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Corporation==
The Seminar reinvigorated itself in the mid-2000s, with faculty additions [[Terry Belanger]], Thomas E. Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, NJ), Daniel De Simone (Rosenwald Curator, Library of Congress), internet specialist Dan Gregory (Between the Covers), [[Kevin Royal Johnson]] (Royal Books, Baltimore), and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. (Rulon-Miller Books, St Paul, MN) joining Seminar stalwarts Ginsberg and Glaser. Participant response was enthusiastic,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, comments by Kenny Parolini, https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124325/http://ioba.org/newsletter/archive/7%282%29/toolbox2.php, accessed 2011-11-01; by Maria Hutchison, http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/08/update-from-the-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar, accessed 2011-11-01; and by Joel Perlman (in the newsletter of the Independent Online Booksellers Association, http://ioba.org/standard/2011/06/2009-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar-cabs-journal-or-teaching-an-old-dog-some-new-tricks/, accessed 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and attendance began to climb. The Seminar's title was given its present form: Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS) and a new [http://www.bookseminars.com website], and the proprietors relinquished their shares to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation called the Antiquarian Book School Foundation. The current director of CABS is Rob Rulon-Miller and the current local coordinator at [[Colorado College]] is Kathy Lindeman; the chairman of the Foundation's board is Rob Rulon-Miller. The ongoing faculty comprises bookseller Lorne W. Bair (Winchester, VA); Terry Belanger (Charlottesville, VA); Brian Cassidy (Silver Spring, MD), Maria Lin (Saint Paul, MN); Katherine Reagan (Curator ofRare Books and Manuscripts, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Rob Rulon-Miller (Saint Paul, MN) and Garrett Scott (Ann Arbor, MI).

Since 1980, nearly 3,000 persons have attended the Seminar, which throughout its existence has had the strong support of the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA): CABS board and faculty members over the years have included ABAA Presidents Thomas E. Congalton, Edwin V. Glaser, Michael Ginsberg, Bernard M. Rosenthal, Robert Rulon-Miller Jr, John Thomson, and others. In recent years, scholarships to CABS have been provided not only by ABAA (Woodburn Scholarships) but also by [[AbeBooks]], [[Biblio.com]], Bibliopolis, IOBA [[Independent Online Booksellers Association]], and the Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association (RMABA) as well as by the faculty themselves. Most of the current attendees are booksellers (or prospective booksellers), but librarians and book collectors sometimes attend, as well.

Now in its 40th year, the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar is the oldest, continuously operated educational institution in the world for the antiquarian book trade, predating Rare Book School in Virginia, which was partially modeled on the Colorado Seminar, by nearly five years. Of the nearly 3,000 or so graduates of the Seminar, a remarkably high percentage of them are still involved in books, either as booksellers, librarians, and/or collectors.

The '''Contemporary Art Society''' is an organisation founded to encourage the awareness and appreciation of [[contemporary art]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Using money donated by its friends and supporters, it purchases works of art which it then donates to public museums and galleries.

==Background==
Founded in 1910, the Contemporary Art Society has since then donated over 8,000 works to galleries and museums, including works by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Lucien Freud]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref name=CAS_01&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/about/|work=Contemporary Art Society|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS enabled the donation of the ''Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection'' (formed by [[Victor Musgrave]] and [[Monika Kinley]]) of about 800 works to the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], University of Manchester, previously on loan for ten years at the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] (IMMA) in Dublin.&lt;ref name=CAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/list-of-works/musgrave-kinley-outsider-art-collection/|work=Contemporary Art Society|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Contemporary Art Society received funding from [[Arts Council England]] towards its core costs; in 2014-2015 this amounted to £175,655.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Art Society|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/contemporary-art-society/|work=Arts Council|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Creative Industries Federation''' is a national organisation for all the UK's creative industries, cultural education and arts. It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision-making.

Through this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries' position as the fastest growing sector of the UK economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html | date = 26 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Anne | last = McElvoy | newspaper = [[London Evening Standard]] | title = Anne McElvoy: Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/business-issues/creative-industries/|title=Creative industries - CBI|website=www.cbi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently worth £91.8bn in Gross Value Added to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/27-november-3-december-2017/creative-sectors-worth-92bn-uk-economy-government-research-reveals/|title=Creative sectors worth £92bn to UK economy, Government research reveals|last=|first=|date=30 November 2017|work=Design Week|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambition of the Federation was to give political clout to a sector that has been the fastest growing part of the UK economy over the previous decade, but had never punched above its weight with government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anne-mcelvoy-can-britains-creative-industries-finally-get-their-act-together-9884864.html|title=Can Britain's creative industries finally get their act together?|last=|first=|date=26 November 2014|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations commenced in March 2014, with early development of the organisation led by the Federation's founding CEO, [[John Kampfner]], and originally funded by more than 200 founder supporters prior to the launch of its membership scheme.&lt;ref name="guardian-brown" /&gt;

The Creative Industries Federation was officially launched in November 2014 with an event at [[Central Saint Martins|Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]]. This event was attended by more than 500 people from across the creative industries and featured keynote speeches by [[George Osborne]], [[Martha Lane Fox]] and UK President of Warner Bros, Josh Berger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/2014/11/25/creative-industries-federation-launches-uk/|title=Creative Industries Federation launches in the UK|last=|first=|date=25 November 2014|website=TBI Vision|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation's membership scheme commenced in January 2015.&lt;ref name="broadcastnow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/uk-creative-industries-launch-federation/5080325.article | date = 24 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Andreas | last = Wiseman | publisher = [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] | title = UK creative industries launch federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/uks-first-independent-membership-organisation-for-the-creative-industries-launches/3039448.article | date = 25 November 2014| accessdate = 2 January 2015 | first = Angus | last = Montgomery | publisher = [[Design Week]] | title = UK’s "first independent membership organisation for the creative industries" launches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year of operation, the Federation forged working relations with the UK government and political parties of all hues, working closely with eight Whitehall departments as well as devolved and city administrations and local authorities. Its work helped secure a better-than-expected settlement for the arts in the November 2015 spending review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/25/arts-council-museums-galleries-relief-funding-settlement-autumn-statement|title=Arts leaders relieved at better-than-expected funding agreement|last=|first=|date=25 November 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Federation's survey prior to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU Referendum]] revealed that 96% of its members backed remaining in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/05/31/creative-industries-federation-members-96-per-cent-against-brexit-eu-referendum/|title=UK creatives reject Brexit, according to poll|last=|first=|date=31 May 2016|website=Dezeen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Federation continued to canvas its members and produce a series of events and reports to help inform UK government policy with regards to Brexit and its potential impact on the creative industries. In February 2017, Creative Industries Federation former CEO, [[John Kampfner]], was invited to present evidence on this issue to a [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] Select Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/impact-of-brexit-16-17/publications/|title=The impact of Brexit on the creative industries, tourism and the digital single market inquiry - publications|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[Peter Bazalgette|Sir Peter Bazalgette]], then chair of Arts Council England, and [[Nicola Mendelsohn]], Vice President EMEA, Facebook.

In March 2017, the Federation announced the appointment of its new chair, [[Richard Haythornthwaite|Rick Haythornthwaite]], who succeeded founding chair [[John Sorrell (designer)|Sir John Sorrell]] in April 2017.

In July 2018, Alan Bishop, former CEO of the Southbank Centre, succeeded John Kampfner as CEO of the Creative Industries Federation.

The Federation is funded through a membership scheme through which it represents more than 1000 organisations drawn from across sectors including advertising and media, animation, architecture, broadcasting, crafts, creative education, creative tech, design, fashion, film, heritage, museums, galleries and libraries, music, performing arts, photography, publishing, video games, visual arts and visual effects.

Members include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals, privately owned businesses, [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]], charities and non-profit organisations, trade associations, universities and further education colleges, and individual practitioners.

The Federation provides members' benefits including research reports, a calendar of networking events, international trends analysis and discount offers for members.

== Work ==
The Federation represents the interests of the UK creative industries to the UK government, the media and the general public.

Policy and research is at the heart of the Federation's work, with its aim being to secure the best possible conditions for growth and continued success for the UK's creative industries, developing policy priorities through consultation with its members. Successes include securing the inclusion of the creative industries in plans for the UK government's industrial strategy, to include an independent review of the sector by Sir Peter Bazalgette to inform an early sector deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bazalgette-review-sets-recommendations-for-continued-growth-of-uks-creative-industries|title=Bazalgette review sets recommendations for continued growth of UK’s Creative Industries|last=|first=|date=22 September 2017|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current focuses include the impact of [[Brexit]] on the creative industries, development of a skilled workforce through creative education in schools, measures to diversify the workforce, improved support for working internationally, access to finance through both public and private funding and the necessary infrastructure such as fast broadband and intellectual property rights protection.

'''''Theodosii De Situ Terrae Sanctae ''''' is a short 6th-century [[travel guide]] to the [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage sites]] in the [[Holy Land]].
Its author is identified as an archdeacon named Theodosius in a 9th-century manuscript (cod. Vaticanus 6018).
The work includes a list of places and routes, and occasionally commentary on relevant biblical passages, combining the genre of ''[[itinerarium]]'' with  stories reminiscent of a  modern [[Travel literature|travelogue]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nicklas in: C. R. Moss et al. (eds.),  ''The Other Side: Apocryphal Perspectives on Ancient Christian “Orthodoxies”'' (2017), p. 26. &lt;/ref&gt;  It was compiled after 518 and before 530, as the author is aware of the construction work done under [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]] but not of that done under [[Justinian I|Justinian]].
Tsafrir (1986) has argued that the topographical information in the work is based on maps used by tour guides, also reflected in the [[Madaba Map]] of the same period. The author inserted additional information based either on his own travels or on accounts by other pilgrims. 

The text is divided into 32 sections or paragraphs.
Sections 1&amp;ndash;6, 27 and 32 have the character of an ''Itinerarium''.
The holy sites in Jerusalem are described in sections 7–11, 17, 21 and 31),
interspersed with descriptions of holy sites in Asia Minor  (12–13, 15, 26), Egypt (14), the Jordan Valley (18–20), Phoenicia (23) and  Arabia (24).
The biblical geography of Jordan is given in section 22, a biblical geography of Paradise in section 16.
A list of provinces in the Holy Land is given in section 25.
Three sections are short narratives: on [[Urbicius (eunuch)|Urbicius]] and the [[Seat of Mary]] (28), The Persians in [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] (29), [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]] on Melitene and Susa (30).

The work was known to [[Gregory of Tours]]. It was also included in the ''[[Otia Imperialia]]'' by  [[Gervase of Tilbury]] (c. 1211). 
Notable manuscripts include codd. Guelferbytanus (Weissenburg 99) (8th/9th c.), Haganus 165 (8th c.),  Vaticanus 6018 (9th c.) and  Parisinus 4808 (9th c.).

The text was edited by T. Tobler (1865), T. Tobler and A. Molinier (1879), [[Johann Gildemeister|J. Gildemeister]] (1882), J. Pomialowsky (1891) and P. Geyer (1898). It has also been translated into a number of European languages. English translations include those by J. H. Bernard (1893) and J. Wilkinson (1977).

{{About|the storytelling style|music produced from within a fictional world|Diegetic music}}{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

'''Diegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|διήγησις}} from {{lang|grc|διηγεῖσθαι}}, "to narrate") is a style of [[fictional|fiction]] storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:
# details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
# the story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince, A Dictionary of Narratology, 2003, University of Nebraska Press, {{ISBN|0-8032-8776-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# there is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.

In diegesis, the [[narrator]] ''tells'' the story. The narrator presents the actions (and sometimes thoughts) of the characters to the readers or audience. Diegetic elements are part of the fictional world ("part of the story"), as opposed to non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story ("part of the storytelling").

== In contrast to mimesis ==
''Diegesis'' (Greek διήγησις "narration") and ''[[mimesis]]'' (Greek μίμησις "imitation") have been contrasted since [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s times. ''Mimesis'' ''shows'' rather than ''tells'', by means of action that is enacted. ''Diegesis'' is the ''telling'' of a [[Narrative|story]] by a [[narrator]]. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the ''invisible narrator'', or even the ''all-knowing narrator'' who speaks from "outside" in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 373 BC), [[Plato]] examines the "style" of "poetry" (the term includes [[comedy]], [[tragedy]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration."([[Plato]], [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], Book III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (''diegesis'') and imitation or representation (''[[mimesis]]''). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary "elsewhere" set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as "hypothetically actual" constructs, since they are "seen" in progress "here and now" without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] argues that kinds of "poetry" (the term includes [[drama]], [[flute]] [[music]], and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or "manner" (section I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III).

== Definition ==
In [[filmmaking]] the term is used to name the story depicted on screen, as opposed to the story in [[Real time (media)|real time]] that the screen narrative is about. Diegesis may concern elements, such as characters, events, and things within the main or ''primary'' narrative. However, the author may include elements that are not intended for the primary narrative, such as stories within stories. Characters and events may be referred to elsewhere or in historical contexts and are therefore outside the main story; thus, they are presented in an ''extradiegetic'' situation.

== In literature ==
For [[Narratology|narratologists]] all parts of narratives—characters, narrators, existents, actors—are characterized in terms of diegesis. For definitions of diegesis, one should consult Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''; [[Gerard Genette]]'s ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method'' (Cornell University Press, 1980); or (for a readable introduction) H. Porter Abbott's ''The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative'' (Cambridge University Press 2002). In literature, discussions of diegesis tend to concern discourse/sjužet (in [[Russian Formalism]]) (vs. story/[[Fabula and syuzhet|fabula]]).

Diegesis is multi-levelled in narrative fiction. Genette distinguishes between three "diegetic levels". The '''extradiegetic level''' (the level of the narrative's telling) is, according to Prince, "external to (not part of) any diegesis." One might think of this as what we commonly understand to be the narrator's level, the level at which exists a narrator who is not part of the story being told. The '''diegetic level''' or '''intradiegetic level''' is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. The '''metadiegetic level''' or '''hypodiegetic level''' is that part of a diegesis that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a [[story within a story]], as when a diegetic narrator himself/herself tells a story.

== In film ==
The classical distinction between the diegetic mode and the mimetic mode relate to the difference between the ''epos'' (or [[epic poetry]]) and ''drama''.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt; The "epos" relates stories by ''telling'' them through narration, while drama enacts stories through direct embodiment (''showing''). In terms of classical [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetics]], the cinema is an ''epic'' form that utilizes ''dramatic'' elements; this is determined by the technologies of ''the camera'' and ''editing''. Even in a spatially and temporally continuous scene (mimicking the theatrical situation, as it were), the camera ''chooses'' where to look for us. In a similar way, editing causes us to jump from one place (and/or time) to another, whether it be elsewhere in the room, or across town. This jump is a form of narration; it is as if a narrator whispers to us: "meanwhile, on the other side of the forest". It is for this reason that the "story-world" in cinema is referred to as "diegetic"; elements that belong to the film's narrative world are diegetic elements. This is why, in the cinema, we may refer to the film's ''diegetic world''.

"Diegetic", in the cinema, typically refers to the internal world created by the story that the characters themselves experience and encounter: the narrative "space" that includes all the parts of the story, both those that are and those that are not actually shown on the screen (such as events that have led up to the present action; people who are being talked about; or events that are presumed to have happened elsewhere or at a different time).

Thus, elements of a film can be "diegetic" or "non-diegetic". These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film, but can apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither taking place in the world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a [[non-diegetic insert]]. Titles, subtitles, and [[voice-over]] narration (with some exceptions) are also non-diegetic.

== In video games ==
In video games "diegesis" comprises the narrative game world, its characters, objects and actions which can be classified as "intra-diegetic", by both being part of the narration and not breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://devmag.org.za/2011/02/02/video-game-user-interface-design-diegesis-theory/ |title=Video game user interface design: Diegesis theory| last=Russell| first=Dave| date=2011-02-02| website=Dev.Mag| access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status icons, menu bars and other UI which are not part of the game world itself can be considered as "extra-diegetic"; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information. A noted example of a diegetic interface in video games is that of the ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series, in which the player-character is equipped with an advanced survival suit that projects holographic images to the character within the game's rendering engine that also serve as the game's user-interface to the player to show weapon selection, inventory management, and special actions that can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/31/4166250/dead-space-user-interface-gdc-2013| title = Deliberately diegetic: Dead Space's lead interface designer chronicles the UI's evolution at GDC| publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]| date = 13 March 2013| accessdate = 15 April 2015| first = Dave| last = Tach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1992">'''Doerner Institute''' was founded in 1937 [[Munich]] as a ''State Testing and Research Institute for Colour Technology'' (in German ''Staatliche Prüf- und Forschungsanstalt für Farbentechnik)''.

== The founding of the Institute ==

The Institute takes its name from [[Max Doerner (Artist)|Max Doerner]], an artist and Munich Art Academy professor. His book, ''The Materials of the Artist and their Use in Painting'' published in 1921 had established Doerner's reputation and his argument which is quoted in Phillip Ball's "Bright Earth" provided the inspiration for the institute. That argument was that ''the artist cannot be expected to be chemist; he would only become victim of a dilettantism more harmful than beneficial....[Yet] the laws which govern the materials of the artist are the same for all artists, to whatever school they belong. Whoever wishes to employ his materials correctly and to the best advantage must know these laws and follow them, otherwise sooner or later he will pay dearly for his mistakes.... Craftsmanship must again be made the solid foundation of art.''&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip (2001) Bright Earth: The Invention of Colour, Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "di"&gt;http://www.doernerinstitut.de/en/geschichte/geschichte_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Activities ==
Since 1977 the Institute has been home to the conservation department of the [[Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen]] as well as its "own" science department. Other activity undertaken at the Institute includes
* research into historical painting techniques and materials
* development of scientific methods applied to objects of art
* museum design or the renovation of historic buildings used as museums.&lt;ref name="di"/&gt;

'''Georges Mora''' (June 26, 1913 – June 7, 1992) was a German-born Australian entrepreneur, art dealer, patron, connoisseur and restaurateur.

== Early life ==
Mora was born '''Gunter Morawski''' on June 26, 1913 in [[Leipzig]], Germany, of  Jewish Polish heritage. As a young medical student Mora became a member of a communist cell and fled Germany to Paris in 1930. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Georges left Paris to join the cause. After a plane crash, he was a prisoner of war for a short time. He was active in the [[French Resistance]] in World War II, using the alias Georges Morand. After the War, Georges worked as a patent dealer and became the director of a Jewish rehabilitation home for children run by [[Œuvre de secours aux enfants]] (OSE) in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;unverified account from his biography on the Georges Mora Foundation website [http://www.georgesmorafoundation.org.au/biography.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Later In 1947 he married Parisian artist and fellow Jewish [[refugee]] [[Mirka Mora|Mirka Zelik]], becoming a French citizen.

== New York and Melbourne ==
In 1949, after the birth of Georges' and Mirka's first son [[Philippe Mora]] (a filmmaker) they joined his family in New York, then in July 1951 moved on to McKinnon, Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Thomas, in 'Creative Displacements: Georges Mora, Rudy Komon, Joseph Brown', in ''Art and Australia'', Vol 30 No 4 Winter 1993,  p. 481, recounts that they were attracted to Australia;
"because his wife, Mirka, had read [in] Murger's ''Scènes de la Vie de Bohème'' [of] a character, the photographer Antoine Fauchery, who had been in Melbourne and Mirka declared, 'Melbourne is so attractive to the French'"&lt;/ref&gt; where he adopted the name Georges Mora. With characteristic adaptability he took up management of a [[matzo]] factory. Seeking more romantic quarters Georges and Mirka moved into [[Grosvenor Chambers]] ([[Ola Cohn]]'s former studio) at 9 Collins Street Melbourne (the so called 'Paris End'). Recognising that their hospitality and cuisine were marketable, the Moras opened a coffee lounge. In 1954, 'Mirka Café' was the first in Melbourne where patrons could eat at tables on the pavement in the Parisian style and the café became the watering-hole of Melbourne's avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Thomas.

The rear of the building became a venue for exhibitions of [[avant-garde]] art and was soon surrounded by other galleries.

Sons [[William Mora]], born in 1953, and [[Tiriel Mora]] (1958), are respectively an art dealer and an actor.

== Tolarno Galleries ==
In 1969, to avoid bankruptcy, Mora sold the Tolarno hotel and leased out the restaurant and gallery. In the early 1970s he separated from Mirka. In 1979, Georges sold the restaurant to Leon Massoni and relocated the Tolarno Galleries to River Street, [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]].&lt;ref&gt;July 14, 1982, Ivan Durrant, [[Asher Bilu]] and [[Luba Bilu]] made an agreement with Leon Massoni, the new owner of Tolarno restaurant, to take over the old Tolarno Gallery, with [[Ivan Durrant]] to create United Artists Gallery, as an artist-run co-operative (1982 to 1985) which included Mike Brown, Dale Hickey, Don Laycock and Peter D. Cole amongst others&lt;/ref&gt; The opening show there included [[lithographs]] by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] secured through his work as a dealer for [[Daniel Wildenstein]].

[[William Mora]] joined his father in running the gallery before setting up his own in the city. Jan Minchin, who came from a position at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], was Georges co-director from 1989. Throughout its career, Tolarno Galleries supported challenging contemporary art,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Smith, Terry E.

In 1985 Georges married artist Caroline Williams when their son, Sam, was born.  Georges was made a [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government in 1989 and he was a strong supporter of the move toward multiculturalism in his adopted country.

== Death ==
On June 7, 1992, at the age of 78, and still energetically running the Tolarno Gallery, Mora died of a brain tumour. He was buried at [[Cheltenham, Victoria|Cheltenham]] New Cemetery, where his grave bears the quip 'Out to Lunch'.

Tolarno continues under the directorship of Jan Minchin in new premises at Level 4, 104 Exhibition Street, Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;not far from the site of ''Mirka Café'' of the 1950s&lt;/ref&gt; George and Mirka's son William Mora continues the family tradition as the director of William Mora Galleries at 60 Tanner St.Richmond.

== The Georges Mora Foundation ==
In Georges' memory [http://www.georgesmorafoundation.org.au/ ''The Georges Mora Foundation''] was established in 2006. It is a not-for-profit cultural foundation dedicated to the promotion of contemporary art and artists in Melbourne and Australia. In May 2006, the foundation was officially launched by Baillieu Myer with inaugural Patron, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. The foundation awards a fellowship each year to a contemporary artist whose work conveys a sense of [[gravitas]]. Georges Mora Foundation Fellowships have been awarded to Jude Walton, Catherine Evans, Inez de Vega, Brook Andrew &amp; Trent Walter, Linda Tegg, Ross Coulter, Philip Brophy, Cyrus Tang &amp; Trinh Vu.

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8458">In [[color theory]], '''color harmony''' refers to the property that certain aesthetically pleasing color combinations have. These combinations create pleasing contrasts and consonances that are said to be harmonious. These combinations can be of [[complementary colors]], split-complementary colors, color triads, or [[analogous colors]]. Color harmony has been a topic of extensive study throughout history, but only since the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Scientific Revolution]] has it seen extensive codification. Artists and designers make use of these harmonies in order to achieve certain moods or [[aesthetics]].

== Types ==
=== Complementary colors ===
Complementary colors exist opposite each other on the [[color wheel]]. They create the most contrast and therefore greatest visual tension by virtue of how dissimilar they are.
==== Split-complementary colors ====
Split-complementary colors are like complementary colors, except one of the complements is split into two nearby analogous colors. This maintains the tension of complementary colors while simultaneously introducing more visual interest with more variety.

=== Color polygons ===
==== Triads ====
Similarly to split-complementary colors mentioned above, color triads involve three colors in a geometric relationship. Unlike split-complementary colors, however, all three colors are equidistant to one another on the color wheel in an equilateral triangle. The most common triads are the [[primary color]]s. From these primary colors are obtained the [[secondary color]]s.
=== Analogous colors ===
The simplest and most stable harmony is that of analogous colors. It is composed of a root color and two or more nearby colors. It forms the basis for a color scheme, and in practice many color schemes are a combination of analogous and complementary harmonies in order to achieve both visual interest through variety, chromatic stability, and tension through contrast.
== Relationship ==
It has been suggested that "Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Burchett, K. E. (2002). Color harmony. Color Research and Application, 27 (1), pp28-31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgement. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st century approach to color harmony:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Color harmony} = f(\text{Col} 1, 2, 3, \dots, n) \cdot (ID + CE + CX + P + T)&lt;/math&gt;

Wherein color harmony is a function (''f'') of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, …, ''n'') and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (''ID'') such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (''CE''), the prevailing context (''CX'') which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (''P'') and the effects of time (''T'') in terms of prevailing social trends.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). Color harmony revisited. Color Research and Application, 35 (4), pp267-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, given that humans can perceive over 2.8 million different hues,&lt;ref&gt;Pointer, M. R. &amp; Attridge, G.G. (1998). The number of discernible colors. Color Research and Application, 23 (1), pp52-54.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound.&lt;ref&gt;Hard, A. &amp; Sivik, L. (2001). A theory of colors in combination - A descriptive model related to the NCS color-order system. Color Research and Application, 26 (1), pp4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or "color harmony". Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as "color harmony"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as "simple harmonies". In addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the "true" second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Feisner, E. A. (2000). Colour: How to use colour in art and design. London: Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahnke, F. (1996). Color, environment and human response. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- the above paragraph (and frankly this whole section) is absurdly vague.  we should get some sources about psychological research with color, and attribute controversial subjective statements to particular authors, instead of presenting them as fact. --&gt;

Color combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is because of the influence of contextual, perceptual and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer.

As early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If it's Purple, Someone's Gonna Die|first=Patti|last=Bellantoni|publisher=[[Elsevier]], [[Focal Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-240-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). Colour psychology and colour therapy: Caveat emptor. Color Research and Application, (Published online in 'EarlyView' in advance of print).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Historic Cairo Restoration Project''' ('''HCRP''') is an effort by the governments of [[Egypt]] and [[Cairo]] to restore and renovate historic [[Islamic Cairo|Medieval Islamic Cairo]].  ''Al-Qahira'' (Cairo) was officially founded here in 969 CE by the [[Fatamid]] caliphs as an imperial capital and walled city, just to the north of the preceding capital [[Fustat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm|title=Cairo, a Millennial|accessdate=2007-08-09|author=Irene Beeson|pages=24, 26–30 |date=September–October 1969|publisher=[[Saudi Aramco World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldpress"&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/2343.cfm Worldpress.org; "Rescuing Cairo's Lost Heritage;" by Rose Aslan; May 10, 2006] . (article first appeared in 'Islamica Magazine' - Issue 15) . accessed 5.25.2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are two parts to the HCRP: the remaking of the historic area and the restoration of its monuments.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U_0RRizglmMC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=Historic+Cairo+Restoration+Project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zwdnAF3m4o&amp;sig=GUSz7z85uW9d_yKmfwf_ky0Zp4k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8kjhTczuEMrmiALFi4XIBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Historic%20Cairo%20Restoration%20Project&amp;f=false Cairo Cosmopolitan: Politics, culture, and urban space in the new Globalized Middle East"] pp. 275-285 - via Google Books . accessed 5.25.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The Historic Cairo Restoration Project is a project started by the governments of Egypt and Cairo. The main project's intention is to create new museums in a sequence of historical sites in an [[open-air museum]] district, that will be widely accessible to both the citizens of Cairo and tourists.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The project is currently focused on restoring historic landmarks from the medieval [[Fatamid]] era in Cairo (969 CE - 1250 CE). The number of potential historic monuments is estimated between 450 and 630 structures.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;

According to the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]], the HCRP  plan is to "''transform the whole area into an open-air museum.''" &lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The HCRP is first focusing on this [[Islamic art]]s district in order to be a part of the [[Museum With No Frontiers]]. This is a museum organized by the [[European Union]], and the Fatimid area project will be a part of its [[Euromed Heritage program]] — "Islamic Art in the [[Mediterranean]]." &lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

===Projects===
A primary concept of the project is to feature the actual historical sites as the main exhibits for this open-air museum by providing extensive information resources and catalogs on-site at each of them. Visitors would therefore be able to truly experience medieval Egyptian culture and history by seeing the structures and sites while concurrently learning more about them from the on-site resources.

As a part of this project, to increase pedestrian accessibility there are plans to create a paved walkway along al-Muizz li-Din Allah, the main ceremonial path of Fatimid Cairo. There are also plans to demolish less significant adjacent [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] structures to create large [[garden]] settings surrounding the landmarks.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Medieval context===
The HCRP has issued many plans, which have been met with resistance by some Cairens, the citizens of Cairo. For example, the plans to create gardens and walkways is seen by some as an assault on the original dense medieval layout and 'urban fabric' of Fatimid Cairo that diminishes the historical value of the retained sites.

The reasoning is that in [[History of Cairo|Medieval Cairo]], the context of a building was determined by its relationship to neighboring buildings. Buildings and monuments of importance were intentionally constructed adjacent to conventional ones, to convey and enhance their high stature and prestige. It is this urban clustering and juxtaposition that actually gives the landmark buildings authentic context and meaning for visitors to experience. Some Cairens think that by eliminating this context from the buildings  the HCRP is lessening the value  and historical understanding of their heritage sites.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

Some architectural conservation experts have claimed the HCRP has used incorrect building materials in its conservation work.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;  Other conservation experts counter that the massive and immediate intervention for landmarks, despite the inevitable mistakes, has stopped the threat of many just disappearing.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

===Funding===
Some residents of historic Cairo have also become suspicious of the HCRP motives, questioning if the project really has historical preservation and interpretation as its true primary intention. Some believe that tourism and commerce are instead the main reason for the project's creation and funding.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The large amount of spending necessary for the intended project has also become a point of controversy, with some estimates as high as $350 million.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;  Some residents believe that the massive cost of creating the open-air museum and restoring its landmarks would be better spent for other local public social and economic needs.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;

Organized by the [[International Thespian Society]], it is held annually in late June on the campus of the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edta.org/educational_events/festival/ | title=Thespian Festival| publisher= Official Website for Educational Theater Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= For love of the theatre | publisher=The Daily Nebraskan | date=2000-06-29 | author= Melanie Mensch| url=http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/06/29/Arts/For-Love.Of.The.Theatre-1732984.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Garel''' (1917 – July 4, 1999) was an American artist. He illustrated cartoons for such notable magazines as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''.

==Early life==
Garel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Max and Sarah Garil (née Kramer); his surname was changed from 'Garil' to 'Garel' to sound more American. Both of Garel's parents were [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants from an area of the [[Russian Empire]] near [[Kiev]].

==Career==
Garel was a mentor, instructor and friend to many who exhibited at and made art upstairs at the Lavendar Door, a Stockbridge tradition that was attached to the Austin Riggs Center.  Thus, Garel, in a natural way, helped hundreds of emotionally charged psychiatric patients paint their way out of difficulties that were often too complex for mere therapy to cure. So many of the lives he touched were literally turned around by the knowledge that if they applied themselves their art could gain an audience.  An audience not judgmental, in a field where most work is done alone:  a perfect combination for those trying to overcome the scars left by myriad unusual circumstances too awful to describe here. His art was superb, but his capacity as a lifesaver was unmatched.

==Later years==
He lived the later part of his life in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] until his death from [[cancer]]. He was survived by a brother, two children and two grandchildren.

'''Literary property''' is a term used in [[publishing]] to refer to works generally covered by [[copyright]] but also an associated set of [[property rights]] that go far beyond what courts have historically permitted to be claimed as [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Writers Guild of America]], for instance, uses this term exclusively to refer to works registered with its [[WGA script registration service]], so as not to restrict the claims it or its users can make regarding their rights.

==Narrower than "intellectual property"==
Since it applies only to literary works and not technological or social constructs such as are covered by [[patent]] or [[trademark]] law, the term is much narrower in scope than the hotly contested term "[[intellectual property]]" sometimes used to refer to all non-physical works in which property rights are recognized.

==Differences between literary property and other non-physical property==
Among other differences, in literary works a very specific concept of [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]] is a critical part of the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for [[invention]]s or [[brand name]]s.  Also, most countries recognize [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] that are not [[alienable]] from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it.  While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.

The '''Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society''' of [[Georgetown University]] is the oldest continuously running collegiate theatre troupe in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehoya.com/countrys-oldest-theater-troupe-shines/ |title= Country’s Oldest Theater Troupe Shines |work= [[The Hoya]] |first= Nicole |last= Jarvis |date= September 7, 2012 |accessdate= November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Society is one of five theatre groups on the Georgetown campus and is entirely student-run. In its 166th Season, the group continues to provide an opportunity for students to develop artistic, technical, and administrative skills, while performing high-quality theatre.

Mask and Bauble produces four main stage shows annually, including the Donn B. Murphy One Acts Festival, which focuses on student-written work. All shows are directed, produced, designed, and performed by students.

==History==
Mask and Bauble was founded in 1852 as The Dramatic Association of Georgetown College, staging its first show, ''[[Pizarro]]'', a play by [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], on February 27, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Georgetown University |last1= O'Neill |first1= Paul R. |first2= Paul K. |last2= Williams |publisher= Arcadia Publishing |year= 2003 |page= 24 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=peQeOeO39JMC&amp;pg=PA24 |isbn= 0738515094}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War I]] priorities caused a suspension of its performances, and after the war the group was revived with the new name of Mask and Bauble. The society was the first of its kind to use female actresses in 1922, as female roles were previously filled by male actors. It formally accepted female members in 1934.&lt;ref name=anelli&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/node/255 |title= Mask &amp; Bauble Provide 148 Years of Theater, GU Tradition |first= Melissa |last= Anelli |work= [[The Hoya]] |date= January 21, 2000 |accessdate= 2009-01-14}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the Society had a close relationship with the Roosevelt White House, with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as a society patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mask and Bauble Club Drama Nearly Ready at Georgetown |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= February 2, 1936 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/240184392.html?dids=240184392:240184392&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=FEB+02%2C+1936&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Mask+and+Bauble+Club+Drama+Nearly+Ready+at+Georgetown&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate= 2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administrations,   student technicians from the group assisted with the technical aspects of some of the nation's first televised presidential press conferences.&lt;ref name=anelli/&gt; This intimate relationship with the White House was nurtured by the society's faculty adviser, [[Donn B. Murphy]], who also served as theatrical adviser to Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]]. Murphy served until 1976, although he remains involved with Georgetown theatre. The Society's annual playwright contest and one acts festival bears his name, and promotes student-written plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mr. Cheap's Washington, D.C. |first1= Corey |last1= Sandler |first2= Michael |last2= Lawrence |first3= Mark |last3= Waldstein |publisher= Adams Media |year= 2002 |isbn= 1580626939 |page= 169 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nG0xrJbPLlcC&amp;pg=PA169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Mask and Bauble  performs in Poulton Hall's Stage Three, on the Georgetown campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Poulton Hall Stage 3 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&amp;id=1027092 |year= 2008 |accessdate= 2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theater space, part of the university, was occupied by  students from the group over spring break in 1975. Unsatisfied  with university commitment to theater, they squatted in what was previously Room 57, and built a makeshift theater they named Stage Two.&lt;ref name=anelli/&gt;  The university forced this to be taken down, but built the group a small theater in Poulton Hall, which became Stage Three. Stage One was then converted into the scene and costume shop. While the club's alumni were very active in raising money to build Georgetown's new Davis Performing Arts Center, the society and other student groups have been restricted from using the Center's main theatre due to their insistence on maintaining student, rather than faculty, direction.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}} In 2009, Mask &amp; Bauble co-produced ''Caroline, or Change'' with the Black Theater Ensemble and the Department of Performing Arts on the main stage of the Davis center, making it the first student directed play on the Gonda Stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/18/AR2009111801648.html |title= D.C.

Club membership currently stands over 100 students, surpassing [[Nomadic Theatre|'''nomadic'''''theatre'']], one of the other theatre organizations on campus.

The '''''Miró Wall''''' is a ceramic tiled wall designed by Spanish artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[Wilhelm Hack Museum]] in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany. The wall, which comprises 7,200 tiles, is {{convert|55|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft}} high.

==Design==
The elements in the mural are colorful and fanciful creatures. The {{convert|55|x|10|m|ft}} mural was produced by [[Joan Gardy Artigas]].&lt;ref name=wilhelm&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miró Wall|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/home/collection/the-miro-wall.html|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the 7,200 tiles based on a design by Miró involving surreal figures and animals. Artigas had to work from an image which Miró had created at one-tenth the scale of the finished wall. Using that model, he marked out each section on an individual {{convert|20|x|36|cm|in}} tile. The artwork was completed in 1979 and includes the signatures of both artists at the bottom, left-hand corner. Miró's signature is undated; Artigas' signature is dated 1979.

Artigas was a second generation surrealist. His father had been a ceramicist for both [[Picasso]] and Miró. When Artigas' father wanted to retire, Miró brought the younger Artigas back from exile in France, where he had been avoiding the Spanish Francoist regime. Artigas junior worked with Miró for twenty years creating other similar sized murals for [[UNESCO]], [[IBM]] and the [[Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos]] in Madrid.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html|publisher=rogallery.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was opened at the same time as the new museum was built. It was in the town's market place and had been constructed to hold the art collection of the [[Cologne]] businessman, Wilhelm Hack, whose collection had been given to [[Ludwigshafen]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/index.php?id=152|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack saw the new museum as he died in 1985.

==Construction==
The tiles were [[Kiln|fired]] in [[Gallifa]], a village near Barcelona. They had to be transported {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to the museum. Because of the terrain, they were placed four to a box so they could be carried down the mountain by mule. After that, the tiles were transported by lorry and train to complete the journey from [[Catalonia]] (Spain) to south western Germany.&lt;ref name=lorry&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intertrans-gmbh.de/index.php?pg=22|title=The wall by Joan Miró|publisher=InterTrans Gmbh|accessdate=28 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall has become discoloured from pollution and has not been cleaned because of the high cost.

It started as a private collection of Byzantine and Old Russian art that obtained the official status of public museum and became member of the IСOM ([[International Council of Museums]]).The museum's collection totals about 4,000 works including about 600 icons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/art-and-culture/icon-museum-opens-moscow/] Russian Icon Museum opens in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum first opened its doors in May 2006 and at that time it occupied a hall in the Vereyskaya Plaza business center. Four years later collection was moved to premises in Goncharnaya street in downtown Moscow.

'''Physical art''', as contrasted with [[conceptual art]], refers to art that [[concrete]]ly exists in physical [[reality]], in [[space]] and [[time]].  Its [[ontology|ontological]] status is that it is a [[physical object]].  The art is [[concrete]]ly realized but may be [[abstract art|abstract]] in nature.  For example, a painting, sculpture, or performance exists in the physical world.  This is contrasted to [[conceptual art]], some but not all kinds of [[performance art]], [[Aesthetics|computer software]], or objects of [[mathematical beauty]], such as a [[mathematical proof]], which do not exist in the [[mental world]] or in [[physical world]], but have other ontological status, such as in [[Plato]]'s world of [[Platonic ideal|ideals]].  Here, the art, may be ''realized'' in the physical world, such as a [[mathematical proof]] written on a chalkboard, but refer to objects that [[existence|exists]] in the [[mind]] as [[concept]]s, not physical objects.  A [[music]] performance is physical, while the composition, like computer software, is not.&lt;ref name=Leo2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|title=A Taxonomy of Abstract Form Using Studies of Synesthesia and Hallucinations|journal=Leonardo|date=February 2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The term "runestone style" in the singular may refer to the [[Urnes style]].'' 
The style or design of [[runestones]] varied during the [[Viking Age]]. The early runestones were simple in design, but towards the end of the runestone era they became increasingly complex and made by travelling [[runemaster]]s such as [[Öpir]] and [[Visäte]].

A categorization of the styles was developed by Anne-Sophie Gräslund in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Anne-Sophie |last=Gräslund |contribution=Dating the Swedish Viking-Age Rune Stones on Stylistic Grounds | title=Runes and Their Secrets: Studies in Runology| publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press| location=Copenhagen |pages=117–140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USIpSluLe10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=87-635-0428-6 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her systematization is considered to have been a break-through and is today a standard. The styles are RAK, Fp, Pr1, Pr2, Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5, and they cover the period 980-1130, which was the period during which most [[runestone]]s were made. 

The styles Pr1 and Pr2 correspond to the [[Ringerike style]], whereas Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5 belong to what is more widely known as the [[Urnes style]].&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer 2000:32&lt;/ref&gt; 

Below follows a brief presentation of the various styles by showing sample runestones according to [[Rundata]]'s annotation.

==RAK==
RAK is the oldest style and covers the period 980-1015 AD, but the Rundata project also includes the older runestones in this group, as well as younger ones. This style has no dragon heads and the ends of the runic bands are straight.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fp==
This style is from the period c. 1010/1015 to c. 1040/1050, when Pr3 appeared. It is characterized by runic bands that end with animal heads seen from above.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pr (profile styles)==
In the styles called Pr1, Pr2, Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5, the runic bands end with animal heads seen in profile.
===Pr1 (Ringerike style)===
This style is contemporary with FP dated to c. 1010- c. 1050 when it was succeeded by Pr3.

Image:U 161, Risbyle.JPG|[[Risbyle Runestones#U 161|U 161]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr2 (Ringerike style)===
This style is only somewhat younger than the previous style and it is dated to c. 1020- c. 1050, and it was also succeeded by Pr3.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr3 (Urnes style)===
This style succeeded FP, Pr1 and Pr2 and is dated to c. 1050- c. 1080.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr4 (Urnes style)===
This style appeared somewhat later c. 1060/1070 and lasted until c. 1100.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pr5 (Urnes style)===
This style was the last one before runestones stopped being raised. It appeared c. 1080/1100 and lasted until c. 1130.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:U 104, Ed.jpg|[[Greece runestones#U 104|U 104]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==KB==
This style is used by the [[Rundata]] project, although it does not attribute it to Gräslund's model. The style is common in western Södermanland and it is characterized by bordered crosses.

'''Ruth Ray''' (1919–1977) was an American painter in the [[Magic Realism]] style.  Educated at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] and the [[Art Students League of New York]], she drew inspiration from the horses and farm life of [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ctpost.com/entertainment/article/Ruth-Ray-s-Nativity-paintings-set-in-red-barns-of-834808.php | title=Ruth Ray's Nativity paintings set in red barns of Connecticut | publisher=Connecticut Post | date=November 26, 2010 | accessdate=December 25, 2011 | first=Phyllis A.S. | last=Boros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ruth Ray was born in 1919 into a sophisticated [[New York City]] household. Her mother was an early [[Feminism|feminist]], a managing editor of [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and a prolific author of self-help books. Ray attended [[Swarthmore College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], and the [[Art Students League of New York]]. In 1948, she married and established a home in [[Darien, Connecticut]]. She had a successful career as a commercial artist and portraitist; among her most famous portraits was the golfer [[Sam Snead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.namos.iupui.edu/artists/Artist.aspx?artist=195 | title=Ray, Ruth: ruth Ray tells more about Sam Snead than his golf swing | publisher=The National Art Museum of Sport | accessdate=December 25, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024014158/http://www.namos.iupui.edu/artists/Artist.aspx?artist=195 | archivedate=October 24, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her passion was an idiosyncratic form of [[Magic realism]] inspired by her love of horses, New England farm life, and the Maine seacoast.

==Works==
Inspired by the surrealists but demonstrating a cultivated sense of restraint in the depiction of her subject matter, Ray juxtaposed the ordinary with the fantastical. "Her art might be called a rational surrealism," opined the critic [[Frederic Whitaker]] in 1957. "Some of her paintings suggest the skill of a Dalí with his irritating shock elements omitted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Whitaker | first=Frederick | authorlink=Frederic Whitaker | title=Ruth Ray | journal=American Artist | volume=21 |date=April 1957 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's paintings are in the collections of several museums, including the [[National Art Museum of Sport]], the [[National Academy of Design]], and the [[Sheldon Museum of Art]]. Her "Swordsplay" (1962) numbers among the illustrations in "The Personality of the Horse."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, Brandt and Edward Sagarin, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeZ4Ley5eaoC&amp;pg=PA44 "The Personality of the Horse]. Wings Books, 1963, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2012-2013 exhibition, "Her Own Style: An Artist's Eye," curator [[Judith Shea]] selected Ray's "Self-Portrait" (1962) as one of thirty-three female artists' self-portraits from among the collection of the [[National Academy Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Zahn, Paula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">The '''Schulze Registers''' are the only surviving record of clandestine marriages in [[Ireland]].

Canon law in the 18th and 19th centuries in Ireland stipulated that [[banns]] should be called or a [[marriage licence]] obtained before a marriage could take place and that the marriage should be celebrated in the parish where at least one of the parties was resident. Also, the marriage had to be celebrated by a clergyman of one of the religious denominations then in Ireland.

Some clergymen were willing, for a fee, to marry couples in secret, in "irregular" or "clandestine" marriages. This might have been necessary for a number of reasons, for example, objections of parents, problems with religious affiliation, or financial difficulty. While most of these "couple-beggars" did not keep a record of the marriages, some did—among them J.G.F. Schulze (died February 1839), minister of the Lutheran Church in Poolbeg Street, [[Dublin]].  He was licensed to act only in his own congregation, but is known to have married couples of all sects, recording over 6,000 marriages between 1806 and 1837. Two of his registers of marriage survive, and are held by the [[Register office#Ireland|General Register Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groireland.ie/history3.htm General Register Office, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;
The marriages performed by Schulze, over 6000, have also been indexed in a book 'Irregular Marriages in Dublin before 1837' by Henry (Harry) McDowell (2015).

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish art''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in what is now Scotland, or about Scottish subjects, since prehistoric times. It forms a distinctive tradition within European art, but the political union with England has led its partial subsumation in [[British art]].

The earliest examples of art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the [[Neolithic]] period. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]]. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the [[Iron Age]]. Elaborately carved [[Pictish stone]]s and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of [[Insular art]] across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the [[Renaissance]] can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. [[Scottish Reformation|The Reformation]] removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court as a result of the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as [[George Jamesone]] and [[John Michael Wright]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the eighteenth century Scotland began to produce artists that were significant internationally, all influenced by [[neoclassicism]], such as [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], [[Jacob More]] and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Towards the end of the century [[Romanticism]] began to influence artistic production, and can be seen in the portraits of artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]]. It also contributed to a tradition of Scottish landscape painting that focused on the [[Highlands]], formulated by figures including [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. The [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] was created in 1826, and major portrait painters of this period included [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]. [[William Dyce]] emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The beginnings of a [[Celtic Revival]] can be seen in the late nineteenth century and the art scene was dominated by the work of the [[Glasgow Boys]] and the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The early twentieth century was dominated by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. [[Modernism]] enjoyed popularity during this period, with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce successful and influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Scotland possess significant collections of art, such as the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow. Significant schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in Scotland is [[Creative Scotland]]. Support is also given by local councils and independent foundations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Museum of ScotlandDSCF6355.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]], as displayed in 2011]]
The oldest known examples of art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late [[Neolithic]] era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name="Towie"&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108, (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]]. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are believed to be the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Iron Age, Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Middle Ages===

{{See also|Scotland in the Middle Ages}}
In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], four distinct linguistic and political groupings existed in what is now Scotland, each of which produced distinct material cultures. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the [[River Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, ''The Medieval State: Essays Presented to James Campbell'' (London: Continuum, 2000), {{ISBN|1-85285-195-3}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictish art can be seen in the extensive survival of carved [[Pictish stones]], particularly in the north and east of the country.

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Stirling Heads]] showing [[James V of Scotland|James V]]]]
Beginning in the fifteenth century, a number of works were produced in Scotland by artists imported from the continent, particularly the [[Netherlands]], generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]];&lt;ref name="Webster1997pp127-9"/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; and [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], such as those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name="Glendinningetal1996p14"&gt;M.

At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and like the surviving carved oak portrait [[Boss (architecture)|roundels]] from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Reformation===
{{Main article|Art in early modern Scotland|Portrait painting in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
During the sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that created a predominantly Calvinist national [[Church of Scotland]] (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Protestant [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Oxford: Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1859735088}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A self-portrait by George Jamesone.jpeg|thumb|left|Self portrait of [[George Jamesone]] (1642)]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth Earl of Seaton (c. 1570s).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94).&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in Devine and Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enlightenment period====
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]]. The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=scottish+artists+italy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=KQipT-rINemP4gTboeyOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20artists%20italy&amp;f=false ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Hamilton studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome for the rest of his life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where John died in 1768/9. Alexander returned home to gain a reputation as a landscape and portrait painter. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p554"&gt;I.

He produced historical and mythical scenes before moving to England, where he pursued portraiture. He then returned to Edinburgh in 1780, became director and master of the [[Academy of Arts]] in 1786. Here he produced his most famous work, with illustrations of themes from Scottish life, earning him the title of "the Scottish Hogarth".&lt;ref name="Houghton2003pp34-5"&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), {{ISBN|0-618-25210-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanticism====
{{See also|Romanticism in Scotland|Scottish genre art}}
Scotland played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in [[German language|German]] literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554/&gt;&lt;ref name=Houghton2003pp34-5/&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name="Withers2001pp151-3"&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|''Highland Loch Landscape'' by [[Alexander Nasmyth]]]]
The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century artists including [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name="Campbell2003pp142-3"&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Knox continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of Scott&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D.

====Painting====
[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
[[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in [[Highland dress]] commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Jones, eds, ''Arab and Islamic Studies'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1997), {{ISBN|9774244028}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name="Szasz200p136"&gt;F.

This was helped by [[Queen Victoria]]'s declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|right|Alexander and Bucephalus by [[John Steell]] (1832)]]
In the early decades of the century, sculpture commissions in Scotland were often given to English artists. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790 – 1858) and [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) undertook work in Scotland, but worked for much of their careers in London and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' (1832). His 1832 design for a statue of [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] to the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside. Public sculpture was boosted by the anniversary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in [[Leith]]. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for [[Dundee]], London and [[Dunedin]]. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early photography====
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|'His Faither's Breeks', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]]]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name="Burn2011"&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0486267504}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93), who pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[Clementina Hawarden]] (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.&lt;ref&gt;G. Clarke, ''The Photograph'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0192842005}}, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of the Pre-Raphaelites====
{{See also|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[William Dyce]] [[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (1858–60?)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail, but puts the biblical subjects in a distinctly Scottish landscape, against the Pre-Raphaelite precept of truth in all things. His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyce became head of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the [[Royal College of Art]], where his ideas formed the basis of the system of training and he was highly involved in the national organisation of art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p209&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855).&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millias was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work included ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arts and Crafts and the Celtic Revival====
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement|Celtic Revival}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: the People's Designer – 1834–1904'' (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reptilian Fabric.jpg|thumb|left|Textile pattern by [[Christopher Dresser]] (1887)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p170"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Glasgow School====
{{Main article|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', by [[Frances Macdonald]] (1909)]]
For the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly represented by the Royal Academy, were often influenced by French painting and incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]], and have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art, making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Colourists====
{{Main article|Scottish Colourists}}
The next significant group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

====Edinburgh School====
{{Main article|The Edinburgh School}}
The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, became known as the Edinburgh School.&lt;ref name="EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool"&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School "The Edinburgh School"], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"&gt;D.

====Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance====
{{See also|Modernism|Scottish Renaissance}}
[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''The Regatta'' (1913)]]
Patrick Geddes coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that technological development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970) and [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981).&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"/&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century".&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p173"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, [http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/review-painters-in-parallel-william-johnstone-william-gillies-1-2063707 "Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone &amp; William Gillies"], ''Scotsman.com'', 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting McIntosh Patrick first gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Scottish Group====
{{Main article|New Scottish Group}}
[[File:JD Fergusson, People and Sails.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. D. Fergusson]], ''People and Sails'' (1910)]]
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, J. D. Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th Century, 1890–2001'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (born 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1/&gt;{{clear}}

Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler.

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (born 1920),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]] and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]].

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (born 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, both grouped under the description of "Scottish realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups"&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255/&gt; and included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (born 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (born 1960) and Adrian Wiszniewski (born 1958). Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work has a comic book-like quality and puts an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wiszniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopts a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employs figures reminiscent characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011"&gt;D. Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie has revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints ''The Saracen Heads'' (1988).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011p406&gt;Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary sculpture===
While sculptors [[Eric Schilsky]] (1898–1974) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93) worked in the existing tradition of modelling and carving,&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; sculptor and artist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.&lt;ref name="Roseetal2012p25"&gt;L.

MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, including Jake Harvey (born 1948), Doug Cocker (born 1945), Ainslie Yule (born 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; In contrast [[Sandy Stoddart]] (born 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Clive Aslet, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3556356/Alexander-Stoddart-talking-statues.html "Alexander Stoddart: talking statues"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', retrieved 12 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:sandy smith object moved edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The first room of the installation ''The Object Moved by its Own Success'', by [[Sandy Smith]] and [[Alex Gross]] (2008)]]
In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (born 1951), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (born 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Art schools and colleges===
{{See also|List of art schools in Europe#Scotland}}
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow School of Art]], designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]]]
Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century, many of which continue to exist in different forms today. [[Edinburgh College of Art]] developed from the Trustees Academy founded in the city in 1760 and was established in 1907. After a long independent history, in 2011 it became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8523596/Edinburgh-College-of-Art-guide.html ''Edinburgh College of Art guide''], ''The Telegraph'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845.

===Organisations===
[[Creative Scotland]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in Scotland. It superseded the [[Scottish Arts Council]], which was formed in 1994 following a restructuring of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], but had existed as an [[autonomous]] body since a [[royal charter]] of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;M.

[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[File:Sheela na gig, St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.jpg|thumb|Sheela na gig on the south-west pillar of the presbytery in [[St Magnus Cathedral|St. Magnus Cathedral]], Kirkwall, Orkney, ca. twelfth-thirteenth centuries, [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]]]

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

A significant number of the figures are found in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] contexts,&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; especially in France, northern Spain, Britain, and Norway. In Ireland figures commonly are found in areas of Norman influence.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">The '''Symphony No. 1 in D minor''', Op. 9, was completed by [[Ernő Dohnányi]] in 1901, when the composer was 24. Premiered in 1902, it is an early work by Dohnányi, and is his first full venture into orchestral writing (the 1896 [[Symphony in F (Dohnányi)|Symphony in F]] was neither completed nor published). Although audibly influenced by the prevailing voices of the time, including [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], the work nonetheless demonstrates a formidable handling of complex compositional techniques and is a notable precursor to what would become Dohnányi's distinctive [[Neoromanticism|neoromantic]] style. As with most of his public work, Dohnányi published the composition under the Germanized version of his name, Ernst von Dohnányi. The symphony is 50–55 minutes in duration.

==Structure==
The work is structured, uncommonly for Dohnányi's time, in five [[movement (music)|movement]]s. It opens with the customary fast movement; the next three are in a slow-fast-slow configuration, with two calmer movements on either side of a vigorous [[scherzo]]. The finale is the work's longest section, and ends in a triumphant conclusion.

The score is marked as follows:

#Allegro ma non troppo  
#Molto adagio  
#Scherzo - Presto  
#Intermezzo - Andante con moto  
#Finale - Introduzione, Tema con variazione e Fuga

==Orchestration==
The symphony is written for an orchestra typical of the late-[[Romanticism in music|Romantic]] era:

*[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]: [[piccolo]], two [[oboe]]s, three [[flute]]s, [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], three [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]]
*[[Brass instrument|Brass]]: six [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]
*[[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]: [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[snare drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]] 
*[[Stringed instrument|Strings]]: 16 1st [[Violin]]s, 10-16 2nd [[Violin]]s, 8-12 [[Viola]]s, 10 [[Cello]]s, 4 [[double bass]]es, 2 [[harp]]s

==Recordings==
There have been two major recordings of this symphony, both in 1998. [[Matthias Bamert]], who had two years earlier conducted the premiere recording of Dohnányi's [[Symphony No. 2 (Dohnányi)|Symphony No. 2]], directed a performance with the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra|BBC Philharmonic]] with [[Chandos Records]] label; [[Leon Botstein]] conducted the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] with [[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]] label. The information of the two recordings is as follows:

*1998: [[Matthias Bamert]] (with the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]]), recorded 1998, released 1998 on ''Dohnanyi: Symphony No. 1, American Rhapsody'' ([[Chandos Records|Chandos Records Ltd.]]) as "Dohnányi: Symphony No. 1" (55:24).
*1998: [[Leon Botstein]] (with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]), recorded 1998, released 1998 on ''Ernst von Dohnányi: Symphony No. 1'' ([[Telarc International Corporation]]) as "Ernst von Dohnányi: Symphony No. 1" (53:39).

In addition to these, numerous informal and unprofessional recordings have been made and are typically not available for purchase.

[[File:Gottfried August Bürger.jpeg|thumb|180px|right|Gottfried August Bürger, author of ''Lenore'']]
'''Symphony No. 5 in E major ''Lenore''''', Op. 177, was composed by [[Joachim Raff]] between 1870 and 1872. It is generally regarded as his best symphony and the most frequently performed and recorded today.&lt;ref name=Symphony&gt;[http://www.raff.org/music/detail/symphony/symph_05.htm Joachim Raff: Symphony No. 5 Lenore]&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by [[Gottfried August Bürger]]'s ballad ''Lenore'', set during the [[Seven Years' War]].

The symphony came during a time of great success for Raff. He already achieved fame with his [[Symphony No. 3 (Raff)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Raff)|Fourth]] symphonies, as well as the opera ''Dame Kobold'', so the orchestras were eager to perform it. The premiere took place in December 1872 at a private performance in Sonderhausen in front of an audience of 20.&lt;ref name=Symphony /&gt; The first public performance took place in [[Berlin]] the following year and it was very well received. The work was performed in other places in Germany, as well as England and America. [[Ebenezer Prout]] reported that at the English premiere "those who were present will remember the sensation created by its performance".&lt;ref name=Symphony /&gt;

Raff described the symphony's programme: "The happiness of two lovers is interrupted by war. The time has come when he must go forth with his fellow soldiers and she remain behind alone. In this solitude evil forebodings take possession of her; she falls into a fever, in which her hallucinations prepare, in reality, only for her own death".&lt;ref name=Symphony /&gt;

== Instrumentation ==

The symphony is scored for [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2  [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[triangle]] and [[string instrument|strings]].

== Structure ==

Just like his [[Symphony No. 3 (Raff)|Third]] symphony, the work is structured in three parts and four movements:

* Part I: Love's Happiness
** ''Allegro'' ([[E major]])
** ''Andante quasi larghetto'' ([[A-flat major]])
* Part II: Parting
** ''Marsch Tempo. Agitato'' ([[C major]])
* Part III: Reunited in Death
** ''Allegro'' ([[E minor]] - E major)

'''Thanjavur painting''' is a classical [[South India]]n [[painting]] style, which was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] from the town of [[Thanjavur]] (anglicized as [[Tanjore]]) and spread across the adjoining and geographically contiguous Tamil country. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the [[Nayak (title)|Nayakas]] of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples.It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676 - 1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramparaproject.org/traditions_tanjor-gold-paintings.html|title=Parampara Project - Tanjore Gold Leaf Painting|publisher=paramparaproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recognized as a [[Geographical indication]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2007-08.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|title=Geographical indication|publisher=Government of India|access-date=28 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826183844/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thanjavur]] paintings are characterised by rich, flat and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are [[Hindu]] gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, ''Sthala-puranas'' and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a ''mantapa'' or ''prabhavali'') surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects.  There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings.

Thanjavur paintings are [[panel painting]]s done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as ''palagai padam'' (''palagai'' = "wooden plank"; ''padam'' = "picture") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India - colourful pieces of art to decorate walls, and collectors' items for art lovers, as also sadly sometimes, dime-a-dozen bric-a-bracs to be purchased from street corner practitioners.

==History==

===Introduction===

Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century [[Chola]] wall paintings in the [[Brihadeeswarar temple]] (''Periya koyil'' or ''Pervudaiyar koyil'' in Tamil) as also paintings from the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] period (many times superimposed on the earlier [[Chola]] paintings&lt;ref&gt;Preserving the past - Unique achievement by archaeologists in restoring Thanjavur paintings - S.H. Venkatramani in Thanjavur  November 19, 2013 | UPDATED 16:06 IST http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/unique-achievement-by-archaeologists-in-restoring-thanjavur-paintings/1/328875.html&lt;/ref&gt;) dating to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_cholabt.asp|title=Great Living Chola Temples, Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur; Temple of Gangaikonda Cholisvaram, Tamil Nadu, Archaeological Survey of India|publisher=asi.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and the sack of [[Hampi]] in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the [[Maratha]] rulers who defeated the Thanjavur [[Nayak dynasty|Nayakas]] began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. Needless to say, the artists absorbed the local influences and the individual tastes of their [[Maratha]] patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. The Thanjavur artists in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, ''chatrams'' and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility.

===Vijayanagara Rayas===
The [[Vijayanagar]] empire, founded by Harihara and Bukka, was for long a bulwark against the rapidly advancing Islamic influence from the nearby Deccan and the farther North. While the foreign influences did gradually percolate into the Peninsular South, the Vijayanagar empire ensured that the older Hindu artistic traditions were protected and preserved.
The empire had reached its zenith under [[Krishnadevaraya]] (1509–29). Its territory stretched across the entire South Indian peninsula, from the [[Tungabhadra]] river in the North to [[Kanyakumari]] in the south and the Malabar coast on the Arabian sea in  the west to the Coromandel coast on the Bay of Bengal in the east at its peak. In 1521-22, [[Krishnadevaraya]] travelled to the Tamil country ''(Tamilagam)'' visiting holy places and as was his wont, made munificent donations to temples and other religious establishments.&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be surmised that some of this munificence was also channeled into art and artists.

===Thanjavur Nayakas===
The Vijayanagar Rayas administered their vast kingdom through Nayaka Governors who also administered the outlying provinces or states under the supervision of the Raya. The third important [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaka]] state in Tamil country, Thanjavur, ([[Gingee|Senji]] and [[Madurai]] being the others) had been established under the reign of [[Krishnadevaraya]]'s half-brother and successor Achyutaraya (1529–42). The Thanjavur Nayaka line commenced with Sevappa Nayaka (1532–72). Sevappa ruled for several years, ably supported by his son Achyutappa (1564-1614), who later succeeded him. It was during Achyutappa's reign that the [[Vijayanagara]] empire fell, leading to the exodus of numerous litterateurs, philosophers, musicians and artists who migrated to several other neighbouring kingdoms like [[Mysore]] and Thanjavur. Achyutappa was succeeded by his son Raghunatha Nayaka who in turn was succeeded by Vijayaraghava Nayaka. Raghunatha, who was possibly the most successful Thanjavur Nayaka ruler, was also a great patron of art and artists and helped establish the unique school of Thanjavur artists who later evolved the Thanjavur style of paintings under the Marathas.

[[File:Venugopala Tanjore glass painting.jpg|thumb|A Tanjore Glass painting of Venugopala Krishna flanked by Gopikas]]

===Marathas===
Due to internal dissensions in the Nayaka line, [[Ekoji]] otherwise called [[Venkoji]] (1676–83), half-brother of Chatrapati [[Shivaji]] marched into Thanjavur on behalf of the Adil Shah of Bijapur under whom he was a General. He subsequently captured Thanjavur and established the [[Maratha]] rule. Despite intermittent wars, when Thanjavur was overrun first by the Nawab of Arcot and later by Haidar Ali, [[Ekoji]] and his successors like Tulajaji, [[Serfoji II]] (''Sarabhoji'' in Tamil) and others remained great patrons of the arts and artists. By the time [[Serfoji II]] succeeded to the Maratha throne in Thanjavur, the Britishers had taken over the complete administration of the state, retaining the king in only a nominal capacity to exercise power over the fort and a smidgen of surrounding lands . Though [[Serfoji II]] had to fight off a spirited competition from Amarasimha, his paternal uncle, to the Maratha throne of Thanjavur, it was during his reign&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thanjavur - A Cultural History by Pradeep Chakravarthy Published by Niyogi books&lt;/ref&gt; that Thanjavur painting flourished and reached the form and style in which we recognise it today. [[Serfoji II]] had to traverse a difficult path throughout his reign, being constantly challenged by Amarasimha who ran a parallel court in [[Thiruvidaimarudur]] even after his accession. However, despite the troubled times, [[Serfoji II|Serfoji's]] reign was a time of great innovations in Thanjavur art and many other parallel fields.

The Maratha rule came to a sad end after the death of its last ruler Shivaji II, (resembling only in name his vastly greater ancestor) who died without a male issue, when the Britishers obliged by annexing the Thanjavur state to its dominions under the notorious [[Doctrine of Lapse]]. After the [[Maratha]] rule waned, the mercantile [[Chettiar]] community continued to patronise the Thanjavur artists. The [[Chettiar]]s being staunch Shaivites encouraged Shaivite themes. One of their monasteries in [[Koviloor]] has large Thanjavur paintings on the lives of the 63 Nayanmars (Saivaite saints) and the 64 miracles (''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam'') of Lord Shiva minutely labelled in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;Thanjavur Paintings in Koviloor  By C. Nachiappan Hardcover Kalakshetra Publications 14 Nov 2004, 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bhimarajagoswami monastery in Thanjavur has a large painting of 108 Vishnu temples. The Britishers who had come into Thanjavur in the wake of the [[Anglo-Mysore wars]] also patronised Thanjavur artists and their paintings.

==Style and Technique==
Thanjavur paintings were made in various sizes depending upon the function, the subject and the choice of the patron. Large paintings of deities and the Maratha rulers, their courtiers and nobility, were painted and installed to serve as architectural accents in the Maratha palaces and buildings. To quote Dallapiccola - ' ''The works, executed on canvas pasted on a wooden support, were framed - a major departure from the pan-Indian tradition, in which paintings are of small size - and designed to be hung on the walls of domestic puja rooms or in bhajan halls. The themes, as in painted albums, (made for European patrons) were usually gods and goddesses, holy places, religious personalities and occasionally portraits. Their dazzling palette consisted generally of vivid reds, deep greens, chalk white, turquoise blues and the lavish use of gold (foil) and inset glass beads. Sometimes precious stones were also used in the paintings. The large format of the majority of such works and the relatively simple composition are the hallmark of the style. This school was greatly inspired by European techniques and was the most popular in Tamil Nadu until the early twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;South Indian Paintings - A catalogue of the British Museum collection by A. L. Dallapiccola Published by Mapin Publishing in association with the British Museum Press&lt;/ref&gt;'

Paintings in addition to being done on canvas, were also done on walls, wooden panel, glass, paper, mica and exotic media such as ivory. Small Ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called ''rajaharam'' and were quite popular.

Thanjavur glass paintings following the techniques of Chinese reverse glass paintings were popularised during [[Serfoji II|Serfoji II's]] reign as a cheaper and faster craft. The paintings were done on the reverse surface of a glass sheet with strips of metal beaten into transparent gaps to simulate the effect of jewellery and precious stones. Most of the paintings were of Hindu deities &amp; saints. Other courtly and secular portraits were also created.

[[File:Raja Sarabhoji of Tanjore.jpg|thumb| Tanjore Glass painting of Raja Sarabhoji]]

A Thanjavur Painting was generally made on a canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (''gopi'') or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made of limestone powder and a binding medium called ''sukkan'' or ''makku'', was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like pillars, arches, thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the sketch.

In the past, artists used natural colours like vegetable and mineral dyes, whereas the present day artists use chemical paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green.  The sky, of course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static and two-dimensional with the figures placed within arches, curtains and decorative borders. The main subject is much larger than the other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European conventions of lighting and perspective.

The British and Victoria &amp; Albert museums in England also house a large collection of Thanjavur paintings in the company and traditional styles. The National Museum of Copenhagen also houses a fine collection of 17th century Thanjavur paintings. King Christian IV of Denmark had received permission to build a fort at Tranquebar ( ''Tharangambadi'' in Tamil) which led to the building of the Danesborg fort as also a Danish relationship with Thanjavur which resulted in the museum collection.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang Mai &amp; Northern Thailand Footprint Focus Guide  By Andrew Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Tanjore paintings were painted by 'Moochys or Artists of India' according to the British chronicler Charles Gold in his book ''Oriental Drawings'' published in 1806. Traditionally, it is well known that the Raju community of Thanjavur and Tiruchi, also called as Jinigara or Chitragara and the Nayudu community of Madurai were the artists who executed paintings in the Thanjavur style.&lt;ref&gt;Tanjore Paintings, A Chapter in Indian Art History by N. S. 'Kora' Ramaswami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanjavurpaintings.com/abouttp.html|title=Thanjavur Paintings - About Thanjavur paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists (Rajus &amp; Naidus) were originally Telugu speaking people from the artistically vibrant "Rayalseema" region of Andhra, who moved to Tamil Nadu in the wake of the fall of the Vijayanagar empire and the establishment of Nayak rule in Madurai and Thanjavur.

The artists turned out a wide repertoire of paintings on different subjects and of varied quality depending upon the patron's interest, urgency and most importantly influence and financial capacity. However, the art was by and large a sacred task to be performed with a reasonable degree of ritual purity and humility by the master craftsmen, many of whom chose to remain anonymous and never signed their paintings, true to the Indian artistic tradition. However a few works signed by the Thanjavur artists are also known. [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]],&lt;ref name="BabbWadley1998"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Lawrence A. Babb|editor2=Susan S. Wadley|title=Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgDHFFe7YM8C&amp;pg=PA55|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1453-0|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; the famous calendar artist from [[Kovilpatti]], was one of the illustrious descendants to make a name as an artist during modern times from the Raju community.

==Influences==

The Tanjore style of paintings spring from a late phase of South Indian classical art, when the society in which it originated was itself going through turbulent times. Needless to say, Tanjore paintings are informed by a syncretic style, notable for its assimilation of the contemporary diverse cultural influences - Tamil, Telugu, Maratha, European, Deccani, Folk, etc. The style drew heavily from the other major South Indian styles of painting which were all deeply influenced by the Vijayanagar school. The closest influences among these could be the [[Kalamkari]] and [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings.

[[File:Tirupati Venkateswarar with consorts.jpg|thumb|left|A portable wooden shrine carrying painted terracotta plaques of Tirupati Venkateswarar and consorts- Circa 19th century CE]]

[[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings, in particular were produced in the famous temple town using different media and techniques, like painted terracotta reliefs, brass repousse works, paintings on paper and canvas, etc. The commonest examples were painted and gilded terracotta relief slabs of the deity, framed and packaged in neat wooden boxes which could be carried back as holy memorabilia and worshipped in the ''Puja room'' by the pilgrim-devotee. Paintings of the main deity, gilded and gem-set, in a manner similar to Tanjore paintings are also known.

[[File:Painted Brass repousse Tirupati Balaji.jpg|thumb|A painted brass repousse of Tirupati Balaji. Circa 19th century CE.]]

Tanjore paintings were also closely related to the crafts of painted and carved wood on the one hand and gilded, stone set jewellery work which flourished in Thanjavur. It is also pertinent to remember that Thanjavur art was functional, in that it was made for a specific purpose on a specific demand from a customer. And it is also in the same context that one understands the iconic style of Thanjavur paintings in contrast to say, the [[Pahari miniatures]] or even [[Surpur paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanjavur Painting of the Maratha Period, By Jaya Appasamy Published by Abhinav publications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vayu.jpg|thumb|left| A Tanjore painting of Vayu on mica in the collection of Government Museum, Chennai]]

==Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s==
Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s, both spring from the same source - Vijayanagara paintings to begin with and Nayaka paintings subsequently. The very same artists, Chitragars and Naidus migrated to various places including Thanjavur and Mysore. This is the reason for the remarkable degree of similarity between the two styles. However, there are many differences that can be made out by the discerning viewer.

The differences are largely in the techniques used to create these artworks and in their distinct iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=95533|title=PIB English Features|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques adopted by the Mysore artists are slightly different from those of the Tanjore School. While Tanjore School used white lime powder and powdered tamarind seeds with gum arabic on cloth stretched on wooden panels, Mysore artists used white lead powder (''Makhisafeda'') or ''Makhi Gamboge'' (yellow) drawn from the juice of the indigenous tree (''Revana Chinni halu'') on paper. The paper sometimes was pasted to a wooden board, but mostly was framed as it was. As against the high relief of the Tanjore 'Gesso' work used prominently across large areas of the painting, the Mysore school preferred low relief, in selected areas such as jewellery, clothing, and borders. The Mysore school used pure gold leaf in lesser quantity as against gold-coated silver leaf handled across larger areas in the painting by Tanjore artists. The use of glass beads, precious and semi precious stones is also very rare in [[Mysore painting]]s. More elaborate and detailed interior and exterior landscapes are featured in [[Mysore painting]]s, whereas Tanjore paintings tend to be more iconic and static. In [[Mysore painting]]s, the jewellery, costumes, architectural features, furniture, etc. reflect the contemporary style prevalent in the [[Mysore Palace]]. The throne on which Gods and Goddesses are shown seated is usually a replica of the Mysore throne in many [[Mysore painting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Painting : The Modern Period by Krishna Chaitanya pages 36 &amp; 37 {{ISBN|8170173108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles however, frequently show traditional temple pavilions (''prabhavalis'') and towers particularly for framing the main characters. However the geographical proximity, constant transmigration of artists and a heavy cross fertilisation of ideas and techniques ensured that one could see Tanjore paintings employing Mysore techniques and vice versa.

==Tanjore paintings in Company style==
[[File:Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820.jpg|thumb|Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820 - British Museum Collection]]

Many of the traditional Indian artists were also patronised by Europeans, beginning with the Portuguese who  landed on the west coast in 1498. Gradually the other Europeans followed suit and commissioned local artists to paint in the so-called company style. While no specific character or technique marked out the Company school of paintings, it can be understood to mean the large body of paintings painted by Indian artists in a mixed Indo-European style which would appeal to the Europeans who were employed by the various East India Companies.

The direct European impact on Tanjore paintings began with the stationing of a British garrison in Thanjavur in 1773, during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] of 1767-99. Throughout the nineteenth century, artists based in and around Thanjavur prepared, by and large a  standard sets of paintings for the Company personnel. These sets were called albums or album paintings and were a collection of 'native' or 'Indian' subjects of interest, suited to the English sensibilities and tastes. Common subjects were Gods and Goddesses, episodes from Hindu mythology; Fairs, ceremonies, processions and festivals; Castes, their occupations and dresses; Indian Flora and Fauna, etc.  These paintings were executed by the same Tanjore artists in a style suited to western tastes. The paintings were usually executed on European paper, without gesso work, little or no Gold foil and without any glass or gem inlay. The paintings would also carry a brief description ( most times extremely quaint and so typically English) of the subject in English and sometimes in Tamil or Telugu. Paintings on cloth backed by wooden panels were also executed for the English patrons. Many of these were carried to England where they probably enlivened many an evening tea!  The [[British Museum]] and The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] have an enviable collection of such paintings.

Though the British patronised paintings tend to be grouped under the Company style of paintings, they were Tanjore paintings in spirit. In addition to being executed by the same traditional group of artists in Thanjavur and the neighbouring Tamil country, the style and characterisation in these paintings are very typically Thanjavur as against the style of say, Company paintings executed in Calcutta or Lucknow.

==Modern Times==
Thanjavur paintings continue to be made even to the present day, though not with the rigour and virtuosity that marked the paintings of yore. 'Revival' programmes, Exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Thanjavur-paintings-steal-the-show-at-Madurai-exhibition/articleshow/20964245.cms|title=Thanjavur paintings steal the show at Madurai exhibition|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops and Training camps on Thanjavur paintings are being held regularly by many institutions including State Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/16/stories/2011051653050700.htm|title=News Archives: The Hindu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Women-queue-up-to-learn-Thanjavur-painting/articleshow/21738811.cms|title=Women queue up to learn Thanjavur painting|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials used have also changed according to the cost, ease of availability and the choice of individual artists. Plywood, for example has by and large replaced Jack and teak wood. Synthetic colours and adhesives are preferred over the natural and mineral colours and other traditional components. In addition to the traditional subjects, a wide range of popular and modern subjects and themes are being depicted in Thanjavur paintings. While it is a happy development that this traditional art continues to hold its sway, the brazen commercialisation and lack of aesthetics are disturbing trends. Be that as it may, Thanjavur paintings - the style and aesthetics continue to inspire many contemporary artists. The Calendar prints of [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]] and his student followers, marked by an iconic solidness as against the western naturalism of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], are examples of the continued influence of Tanjore paintings in modern, popular and academic art.

Artists have taken this old form of art and over the years combined it with other styles to create mixed media arts. For example, tanjores are also done on mirrors, glass and canvas. The idea of applying gold foil is unique to this traditional art, so this same style is taken and recreated on different mediums.

'''''The Amazing Bone''''' is a 32-page [[picture book]] by [[William Steig]] from 1976. It was nominated for the [[Caldecott Medal]] in 1977; however, [[Leo &amp; Diane Dillon]]'s ''[[Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions]]'' won, so ''The Amazing Bone'' only received the [[Caldecott Honor]] Award.&lt;ref name="Haase2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Donald|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: Q-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVHhj-GIk0wC&amp;pg=PA919|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334443|page=919}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Steig's few books in which the main character is a female.

The story is about how Pearl the [[pig]] is walking home from school, and finds a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] bone on the ground, which has the ability to imitate any sound and speak in any [[language]] (It samples Spanish, Polish and German for her). Pearl takes it with her, and on the way home they have several misadventures, including an encounter with a hungry [[fox]] who wants to eat Pearl for dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/arts/design/03conn.html|title=Worlds Outfoxed by a Wily Inner Child|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|date=3 March 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was featured in an episode of the [[PBS]] television show ''Storytime'' in which it was read to a live audience.

==Adaptation==
In the mid 80's a short [[animation|animated]] film was made of this book, with [[John Lithgow]] as the narrator. Lithgow also gave his voice for another film adaptation of a William Steig book, ''[[Shrek]]''.

A children's musical was produced at [[Lifeline Theatre]] in Chicago, Illinois in 1996.  This adaptation, by [http://www.ericlanebarnes.com Eric Lane Barnes], was also produced at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100216073354/http://www.pigandbone.com/Site/Home.html Morgan-Wixson Theatre] in Santa Monica, California in 2010.

'''''The Execution of Marshal Ney''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''L'exécution du maréchal Ney'''}}) is an 1868 painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. It depicts the French Marshal [[Michel Ney]] right after his execution on 7 December 1815, with the firing squad seen walking from the site. On the wall behind Ney's corpse are two inscriptions: one that says "vive l'empereur" ("long live the emperor") and is crossed out, and one that says "vive" right before the bullet holes from the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2010|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gérôme this was a comment on Ney's multiple shifts of allegiance between [[Napoleon]] and the [[House of Bourbon]].&lt;ref name="mitchell98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2010|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been owned by the [[Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust]] since 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-execution-of-marshal-ney-71726|title=The Execution of Marshal Ney|publisher=[[Art UK]]|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was presented at the 1868 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]]. On behalf of Ney's descendants, Gérôme was asked to withdraw the painting, but did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2010|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general reception was very split and the 1868 Salon marked the beginning of a lasting divide between Gérôme and many French art critics. Those who were negative accused the painting of relying on literary techniques, of commercialising art, and of bringing politics into art.&lt;ref name="mitchell98" /&gt; Henri Oulevay made a caricature where Gérôme is depicted in front of the wall with the art critics as the firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2010|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Théophile Gautier]] wrote a positive review where he highlighted the many details that give the picture meaning, Gérôme's treatment of the death theme and how the painting captures a mental climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2010|pp=96–97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacob_Jordaens_-_The_Bean_King_-_WGA11982.jpg|thumb|St Petersburg version]]
'''''The King Drinks''''' or '''''The Bean King''''' is a c.1638 painting by [[Jacob Jordaens]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg. 

Its history is unknown before 18 August 1762, when it was sold at the Wirman auction in [[Amsterdam]]. It was resold at the sale of J. van der Mark's collection on August 25 1773. By the end of the 18th century it was already in [[Alexander Bezborodko]]'s collection, from which it was inherited by [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko]], who in turn left it to the Museum of the Academy of Fine Arts. It was transferred to a new canvas by the restorer Umetsky in 1905. The Museum of the Academy of Fine Arts was dissolved in 1922 and ''The King Drinks'' and most of its other works were moved to the Hermitage Museum.

'''''Venus and Cupid'''''  is a painting by [[Lorenzo Lotto]] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].  It probably dates to the mid-1520s, but has been dated as late as the 1540s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is a wedding gift for a couple of [[Bergamo]] or [[Venice]]. Such paintings were inspired by the classical tradition of [[Epithalamium|wedding poetry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description ==
[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], lying on the ground and leaning on an elbow on a blue cloth, is accompanied by her son [[Cupid]] standing with his bow and quiver. He  urinates on the bride through a crown of laurels of myrtle which she holds by a ribbon and below which is suspended a burning incense burner. This urine stream is symbolic act, the meaning of which is to bring fertility,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Bonnet, Lorenzo Lotto, Adam Biro, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and which would have seemed humorous to contemporary viewers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is on a background of red hanging tied to a tree on which climbs ivy. Around them are scattered allegorical objects of marriage (garland of myrtle), femininity (rose, seashell, rose petals), eternal love (ivy). The headdress of Venus, with the tiara, the veil and the earring, is typical of the Venetian brides of the sixteenth century. The pendant earring with a pearl is a symbol of purity. The gesture of Cupid that urinates through the crown on the belly of Venus is an erotic allusion to fertility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The painting is Lotto's typically individual contribution to the emerging Venetian tradition of the recling nude, begun by the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Dresden Venus]]'' by [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]]. The goddess shows no discomfort with her nakedness and looks at the spectator in the eye. In front of her are a stick and a snake. The goddess seems to bless the marrying couple, wishing them fertility, and preserving them from hidden dangers like the serpent.

== History ==
This painting is not recorded until an image of it was published in the ''Directory of paintings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'' by [[Salomon Reinach]] in 1918, as being with a French dealer in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125007969849#page/n669/mode/2up|title=Repertoire de peintures du Moyen Âge et la Renaissance (1280-1580)|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 it was acquired by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Before the purchase, the painting was [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|cleaned]] at the Metropolitan, notably cleared of its repainting (at the level of the headdress of Venus, draped on her right thigh and bouquet held by Cupid).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436918|title=Lorenzo Lotto {{!}} Venus and Cupid {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:View of Geelong 1856 painting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''View of Geelong'', painted by [[Johann Joseph Eugen von Guerard]] in [[1856 in art|1856]].]]

:''Throughout this article, the $ symbol refers to the [[Australian dollar]].''&lt;!-- Disclaimer is as per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers) #Currency --&gt;

'''''View of Geelong''''' is an 1856 [[oil painting]] on canvas by [[Eugene von Guerard]]. The painting measures 154.5 x 89cm and is owned by the [[Geelong Art Gallery]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.geelonggallery.org.au/collections/#details=ecatalogue.4937 View of Geelong] at the Geelong Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

It was purchased from English composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] for $3.8M. The purchase is the second highest ever for an Australian work of art, with the top being $5.3M paid by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] for a portrait of [[Captain James Cook]] by [[John Webber]]. [http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,19709055%255E2902,00.html]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}

Lloyd Webber had bought the painting in 1996 for A$1.98 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/lloyd-webber-sells-geelong-masterpiece/2006/05/12/1146940719620.html |title=Lloyd Webber sells Geelong masterpiece |date=12 May 2006 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the painting was loaned to the Geelong Art Gallery, where it proved popular.&lt;ref name="sixslayings"&gt;[http://www.geelonggallery.org.au/events/view_of_geelong.htm The future of a Geelong icon needs your support], Geelong Art Gallery {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103221/http://www.geelonggallery.org.au/events/view_of_geelong.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Lloyd Webber offered the painting for sale via auction house [[Christie's]] of [[London]], giving the Geelong Gallery first right of refusal. On July 7, 2006, the Geelong Gallery purchased the painting for permanent display in the Geelong Gallery, after being offered $1.5 million from the Victorian state government and the remainder being sought via a community fundraising appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Bronwyn |date=30 July 2016 |title=Eugene von Guerard’s View of Geelong a glimps of Victoria’s promise |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/eugene-von-guerards-view-of-geelong-a-glimps-of-victorias-promise/news-story/30c08e5db9ac1a8e2587ac01301ea527 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=12 January 2018 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
