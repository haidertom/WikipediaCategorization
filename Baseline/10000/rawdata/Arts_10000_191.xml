The '''Alcalá de Guadaira school''' was the name given to the circle of painters, initially brought together by [[Manuel Ussel de Guimbarda]], who from 1890, centered on the figure of [[Emilio Sanchez Perrier]], assembled and painted [[en plein air]] on the banks of the river [[Guadaíra (river)|Guadaíra]], near [[Seville]].

'''Amanda Newton''' (ca. 1860-1943) was a botanical illustrator for the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) who specialized in watercolors of fruit. Her work is now preserved in the USDA's [[Pomological Watercolor Collection]], and she is the second-most prolific contributor to that archive of 7600 paintings, with her work representing roughly one-sixth of the total.

==Early life and education==
Amanda Almira Newton was born around 1860. She was the granddaughter of [[Isaac Newton (agriculturalist)|Isaac Newton]], the first commissioner of the USDA, who died when she was a child; later in life, her colleague at the USDA, [[Royal Charles Steadman]], would paint a portrait of her grandfather for her.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

==Career==
Newton worked for the USDA from 1896 to 1928.&lt;ref name=south/&gt; This was a time when the major fruit-producing regions in the United States were just beginning to emerge, as farmers worked with the USDA to establish [[orchard]]s for expanding markets. Photography was not yet in widespread use as a documentary medium, so the government relied on artists like Newton to produce technically accurate drawings for its publications.&lt;ref name=fusonie/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Newton was one of more than 50 skilled botanical illustrators hired in this early period—among whom were [[Elsie Lower Pomeroy|Elsie Lower]], [[Ellen Isham Schutt]], [[Royal Charles Steadman]], and [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]]—and she was one of the most productive, turning out more than 1200 finished watercolors for the USDA.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

Newton's artwork for the USDA covered a wide range of fruit and nuts, principally [[apple]]s, of which there are many hundreds of examples. There are also paintings of [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[plum]]s, [[citrus]], [[persimmon]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[cherry|cherries]], as well as fruits that are still not commonly grown in the continental United States such as [[loquat]] and [[baobab]]. Most of her watercolors show a whole and a half fruit in full color; a few (such as the strawberry and cherry paintings) show foliage as well. Her style is precise and detailed, combining vigorous lines with subtle color modulations. Newton signed her work 'A.A. Newton'.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

In addition, beginning in 1896, Newton made [[wax]] models of some 300  specimens of fruits being grown or tested in the United States. She inaugurated production of these wax models for the USDA and later showed some of them at the [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]] and the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]].&lt;ref name=wax/&gt; For the latter exposition, she created some models showing how environmental conditions, cultivation practices, and storage conditions affect the fruit's condition and keeping qualities.&lt;ref name=lpe/&gt;

Newton's original paintings are now in the USDA National Agricultural Library's [[Pomological Watercolor Collection]].&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

The '''Bardia Mural''' was created in a building on a clifftop overlooking the bay in [[Bardia]], [[Libya]], during [[World War II]] by [[John Frederick Brill]] just prior to his death at the age of 22.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a collage of images that range from the horrors of war shown by skulls to the memories of home, shown by wine, women and song.

The mural still exists and can still be visited.  It has, however, been defaced and its state has declined with a large crack in the wall on which it was created.  Much of the lower part of the mural is lost.

As of April 2009, renovation work had been started by Italian artists who have filled the cracks and replaced broken plaster. Parts of the mural have been cleaned removing graffiti and restoring some of the 'blackness' of the paint.&lt;ref name="Donald Simmonds"&gt;

== Mural description ==
[[File:Bardia07.JPG|thumb|The Bardia Mural building.]]
As can be seen from the photograph taken in the sixties, while the mural was still largely intact, it originally depicted Brill's memories of home, as well as the horrors of war. From left to right images of a boxer overlay a newspaper, beneath which money and piles of skulls, are followed by grasping hands reaching up to repeated and overlaid images of apparently naked women, whose facial features change subtely. Above these women can be seen the artists signature reference to the [[Royal Army Service Corps|R.A.S.C.]] and the date of ''21 4 42'', with a further repetition of skulls above the signature. The image continues to unfold, on the other side of what appears to be a curtain separating the two sides of the mural, with pages of music, a grand piano and a table laid for a sumptious meal (many knives and forks), under which are fitted a number of books, which according to Lydia Pappas &lt;ref name="Lydia Pappas"&gt;

represent the works of [[Charles Dickens]] From left to right: ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''; ''[[Barnaby Rudge]]''; ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]''; ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' and ''The Pickwick Papers''. The image flows on to a conductor with more music, followed by a number of men's faces watching three ballet dancers, who are dancing on a floor of musical notes, the mural ends with the image of a face looking out of a window high up in a brick wall at the top right hand corner of the mural, which has variously been suggested to be the artist himself, or a relative back in "[[blighty]]" awaiting his return.

== History ==
[[Image:Alamein2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Commonwealth War Cemetery, [[El Alamein]]. John's final resting place.]]
According to his mother,&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother"&gt;{{cite web |last=Seccombe |first=John |url=http://bardiamural.pbwiki.com/%5BBardiaMural |title=Letter to John Seccombe from Brill's Mother |accessdate=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brill developed a passion for art at a young age. Having studied at the [[Royal Academy]], he then went on to pass the entrance exam to study a 3 year diploma course at the [[Royal College of Art]] when the war broke out. His mother wrote, "His creed was that in order to become a great artist, he must suffer. Consequently he joined the Infantry, believing that to be the roughest and hardest of the services."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; He fought in Europe and survived Dunkirk, after which his regiment was posted to the Middle East

John Frederick Brill was a Private in the 5th Battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]].&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission"/&gt; He signed the mural on 21 April 1942,&lt;ref name="Signature"&gt;{{cite web |last=Simmonds |first=Donald |url=http://www.don-simmonds.co.uk/updates1.htm |title=Signature Close Up |accessdate=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a matter of weeks before his death. He died on 1 July 1942, the first day of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], aged 22.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission" /&gt; He was buried at the El Alamein War Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission" /&gt;

===Controversy===
Early versions of the history of the Bardia Mural involved controversy. While it is commonly accepted that the mural was painted with paint, some versions stated that the material used to create the murals was Boot Black.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} There were also arguments over John's status when he painted the mural, indicating him as a [[prisoner of war]] or even under a [[death sentence]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These three questions were referred to in a letter to the "Old Codgers" section of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Brill's mother Eliza later wrote a letter, to answer the controversies, on 31 January 1966, having been shown a copy of the article about the mural which she knew her son had painted before his death. In the letter she stated that he originally painted a mural on each of the "four walls of the lad's canteen, which represented 'A Soldier's leave in Cairo'. This - I understand, afforded them much interest &amp; amusement".&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt;
Following this the Officers asked Brill to create Murals in their Officer's Mess. According to John's mother the picture below represents one of these murals. The subjects being "The Pleasures of Avarice" and "The Pleasures of Art", and a third subject of "The Last Supper', "but this was never finished as his company was moved up the line." The Bardia Mural is likely to be one of these.&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; She goes on in her letter to state "I am thankful to say, that he was not under sentence of death, neither was he ever a prisoner."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; She also states that the material used to create the various murals he painted during this period was paint, and not boot black; "paints were bought in Cairo, by the lads on leave and sent up by Convoy to Bardia. I understand that the costs were defrayed from the N.A.F.F.A. ''(sic)'' funds."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; It is likely that she meant to refer to [[NAAFI]] funds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' ({{lang-de|Bibliographie des Musikschrifttums}}), also known as '''BMS''' or [http://www.musikbibliographie.de:80/LNG=EN/ '''BMS ''online'''''], is an international [[bibliography]] of literature on music. It considers all kind of music and includes both current and older literature. Since 1968, the BMS editorial  staff has been working as the German committee for [[RILM]], too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rilm.org/globalNetwork/country.php?country=Germany RILM National Committee of Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography includes [[monograph]]s, master’s theses and doctoral [[dissertation]]s, articles and reviews from journals, [[Festschrift]]en, [[Proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[yearbook]]s, [[Anthology|anthologies]], and essays from critical reports. It contains [[Printing|printed media]] as well as [[Electronic publishing|online resources]], data media, sound recordings, audiovisual media, and [[microform]]s. Each record provides the title in the original language (for [[Eastern Europe|East European]]- and [[Asia]]n entries a German translation is added), full bibliographic data, a keyword index, and mostly an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]. 
Currently, '''BMS ''online''''' has more than 315,000 [[Bibliographic record|records]] of literature on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Musikverzeichnisse#Musikbibliographien Wikisource-Music directories]&lt;/ref&gt; It is supplemented by the [http://uri.gbv.de/database/olcssg-mus '''OLC-SSG Musicology'''], which incorporates the contents of some more 150 music journals from 1993 onward. '''BMS ''online''''' participates actively on [[Virtual Library of Musicology|ViFaMusik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamusik.de/literature.html?L=1&amp;cHash=2d26cd0946314ea51422f6a01ed26e4d BMS ''online'' in the Virtual Library of Musicology]&lt;/ref&gt; the central gateway for music and musicology in Germany.

==Format==

'''BMS''' was established in 1936 by the [[State Institute for Music Research]] in Berlin with the aim to list literature on music from all over the world. It was published in print from 1936 through 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiz1.fh-potsdam.de/volltext/diplome/05005.pdf Silvia C. E. Mai, ''Anforderung an eine Datenbank im SIM - Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung'', Berlin 2004, p. 4/ p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is available as '''BMS ''online''''' in a [[Online database|cumulative online database]], which is updated in real-time.

==History==

Established in 1936, the '''BMS''' resumed the bibliographic surveys printed in the [https://archive.org/details/jahrbuchdermusi00petegoog '''Jahrbücher der Musikbibliothek Peters''']. The first '''BMS''' editor was [[Kurt Taut]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Karstädt]]. Originally printed by [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Friedrich Hofmeister]] in Leipzig (Leipzig: Hofmeister, 1936-1941 [volumes 1.1936 to 4.1939]), after a span of four years '''BMS''' was stopped due to wartime limitations. The commencement of this bibliographic enterprise after World War II is owed to the musicologist and librarian [[Wolfgang Schmieder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/musik/mushist.html Wolfgang Schmieder CV in the University Library of Frankfurt a. Main]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the reconstituted [[State Institute for Music Research]] the first volume for 1950/51 appeared in 1954. Since that time the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' has been a regular publication of the [[State Institute for Music Research|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung]]. The last volume in print format was published in 2001 and covered the year 1988 (Frankfurt am Main: [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1954-1968 [volumes 1.1950/51 to 6.1960], Mainz: [[Schott Music|Schott]], 1969-2001 [volumes 1961 to 1988]). Since 2006, there has been the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' as '''BMS ''online'''''.

"'''Bookland'''" is the informal name for the [[Unique Country Code]] (UCC) prefix allocated in the 1980s for [[European Article Number]] (EAN) identifiers of published [[book]]s, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN [[namespace]] can catalogue books by [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. In other words, Bookland is a fictitious country that exists solely in EAN for the purposes of non-geographically cataloguing books in the otherwise geographically keyed EAN coding system.

== History ==
Until January 1, 2007, all ISBNs were allocated as 9-digit numbers followed by a [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 11 [[checksum]] character that was either a decimal digit or the letter X.  A Bookland EAN was generated by concatenating the Bookland UCC 978, the 9 digits of the book's ISBN other than its checksum, and the EAN checksum digit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isbn-information.com/the-13-digit-isbn.html Anatomy of a 13-digit ISBN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Z5I3gnFh0C&amp;pg=PA265 |title=Elementary number theory with applications |author=Thomas Koshy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since parts of the 10-character ISBN space are nearly full, all books published from 2007 on have been allocated a 13-digit [[ISBN]], which is identical to the Bookland EAN.  Most of UCC 979  (formerly "Musicland") has now been assigned for the expansion of Bookland,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjveruEBBfoC&amp;pg=PT41 |title=Book Marketing Demystified |author=Bruce Trelawny Batchelor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used by publishers in the French language, which can now use the additional prefix "979-10-" in addition to the nearly full "978-2-" prefix (onto which legacy 10-character ISBNs starting with "2-" have been remapped).  Books numbered with prefixes other than 978 will not be mappable to 10-character ISBNs.

The GS1 is the global identification standards organization for retail. Every country has an assigned country code which precedes the company code. The "country codes" 978 and 979 are now officially registered for allocation by the [[International ISBN Agency]], which maintains the official international registry of ISBN numbers allocated to book publishers.

==Similar mappings==

* [[ISSN]]s (which identify [[periodical publication]]s) are mapped into the UCC 977.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKcpAQAAIAAJ |title=International literary market place |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISMN]]s (which identify [[sheet music]]) are mapped into the UCC 979. Since the leading "M" of a legacy 10-digit ISMN number (such as M-345-24680-5) is transcoded as 0, the EAN prefix 979-0 is wholly reserved for sheet music and has been dubbed the fictitious country "Musicland". Like ISBNs, ISMNs have been officially allocated using 13 digits since mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ismn-international.org/download/GuidelinesGeneral.pdf Guidelines for the Implementation of 13-Digit ISMNs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Talent Booking''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[booking agency]] with offices in [[Los Angeles]].  Since its founding in 1999, CTB has built its business primarily by finding [[celebrity]] and [[human interest]] talent for television programs, particularly [[talk shows]], though the company has regularly worked with [[publishers]], developers of [[web content]] and [[band (music)|music groups]].

==History==

Founded by Joanna Jordan in 1999, Central Talent Booking began in a small, home office after Jordan had spent five years working as the in-house booker at the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]. According to a ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' article, when Jordan told Late Show executives of her plans to start her own company, they offered her their business as the company's first client.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Niche-Oriented." Hollywood Reporter 12 Dec 2005 &lt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614834&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  CTB booked guests for two of the Late Show's [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series|Emmy]]-award winning seasons, in addition to three others won while Jordan and other CTB staffers were still working for Letterman.

CTB continued to grow well into the 21st Century, picking up business from runaway hits such as [[Punk'd]] and [[Best Week Ever]], and by 2007 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was already calling Jordan "one of the industry's premier bookers."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Booking talkshows spawn rigid rules." Variety 5 Oct 2007 &lt;http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973524.html?categoryid=1019&amp;cs=1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

CTB has also been noted by industry observers for raising the profile of one of the company's bigger clients, [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]] In a 2008 article, [[TV Guide]] referred to Jordan as the "force behind" the [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#"I'm Fucking Ben Affleck" video|'I'm F-ing Ben Affleck' video]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Zoë. "She's Booking Ben Affleck!". TV Guide 6 June 2008: 36.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Can't find a URL for the article, but here's a link to a scan of it: https://www.flickr.com/photos/49429632@N03/4535619880/--&gt; and in the same article Kimmel quipped, "I wish I'd had her in high school when I was looking for a date to the prom."

==The Highland Widow==

===Plot summary===
The MacTavish family lived near [[Oban]] in 1775. Hamish MacTavish ''Mohr'' ("Senior"), a daring freebooter, had met his death in an encounter with the Saxon red-coats, by whom the Highlands were garrisoned after the [[battle of Culloden]]. His wife, who had shared all his dangers, strove to inspire their only son with his father's love of adventure and hatred of servile toil; but as he grew up the lad evinced no inclination for lawless pursuits, and, unable to endure his mother's taunts at his want of spirit, enlisted in one of the regiments formed in Scotland to oppose the French in the [[American war of independence]]. Before sailing he sent her some money by Phadraick, and returned to spend a few days with her, when she fiercely reproached him for daring to act in opposition to her will, and, failing to alter his purpose, drugged his parting-cup, thus causing him to exceed his furlough, and render himself liable to the lash as a deserter. She then urged him to flee to her kinsmen, while she baffled his pursuers; but he resolved to await the arrival of the sergeant and men of his regiment who, he felt sure, would be sent to arrest him. They came and summoned him to surrender, but because they could not assure him against the lash, and provoked by his mother, he shot the sergeant dead. The other soldiers secured him, and he was marched as a prisoner to Dumbarton castle, where he was tried by court-martial and condemned to be shot. His captain and a Presbyterian minister interceded for him; but the English general in command was determined to make an example, and the next morning his sentence was carried out in the presence of his comrades.

His mother, who had attempted to follow him, was met by the minister wandering in a wild glen, and on hearing her son's fate, she uttered terrible imprecations, and renounced all further intercourse with the world. She lived, however, for many years in her lonely cottage, regarded with awe and pity by her neighbours as the victim of destiny, rather than the voluntary cause of her son's death and her own wretchedness. At length, while two women, who had been set to watch her last moments, were sleeping, she disappeared from her bed, and was never heard of again.

===Characters===
* Hamish MacTavish ''Mohr'', an outlaw
* Elspat, his wife
* Hamish ''Bean'' ("Junior"), their son
* Miles Phadraick, a farmer
* Rev Michael Tyrie, a Presbyterian minister
* Green Colin, captain of Hamish Bean's regiment

==The Two Drovers==

===Plot summary===
In 1795, Robin Oig was just starting from [[Doune]] with a drove of cattle for England, when his father's sister, who was supposed to be gifted with second sight, drew his dirk from the folds of his plaid, and, exclaiming that there was Saxon blood on it, induced him to entrust the weapon to Morrison, who undertook to return it when asked for. At [[Falkirk]] the Highlander met his bosom friend, Wakefield, and they travelled southwards together. Having reached [[Cumberland]], they separated to hire pasturage for their beasts, and it happened that while the Englishman bargained with the bailiff, the Highlander came to terms with the squire, and they thus both secured the same enclosure. On discovering this, Wakefield reproached his comrade with having played him false, and, angrily refusing his offer that they should share the field, had to be content with a barren moor belonging to the landlord of the alehouse, where they had agreed to pass the night.

The squire had invited Oig to sup with him, and mentioned having passed Morrison a few miles off. On reaching the inn the Highlander met with a cold reception from the assembled company, who sided with Wakefield, and egged him on to challenge Oig to a Cumberland tussle. But the Highlander would have shaken hands, and, refusing to fight except with swords, he attempted to leave the room. Wakefield, however, opposed his doing so, and struck him senseless to the ground. Frantic with rage when he revived, and prevented by the hostess from attacking his comrade, Oig sullenly went out, warning him to beware. Striding over the moonlit moor to meet Morrison, he obtained his dirk on the pretence that he had enlisted, and, returning to the alehouse, he stabbed Wakefield through the heart.

At his trial the judge made every allowance for the provocation Oig had received, but pointed out to the jury that, as he went to recover possession of his weapon, there was ample time for his passion to have subsided, and for him to have reflected on the guilt of his meditated revenge. He was, accordingly, convicted of murder, and having been sentenced to be hanged, he met his fate with the observation, "I give a life for the life I took, and what can I do more?"

===Characters===
* Robin Oig MacCombich, a Highland drover
* Janet of Tomahourich, his aunt
* Hugh Morrison of Glanae, a Lowland drover
* Harry Wakefield, an English drover
* Mr Ireby, a Cumberland squire

* Hortence Bennet, his lover

==The Surgeon's Daughter==

===Plot summary===
Gideon Gray was a surgeon who lived in [[Fife]] in the late 18th century. The surgeon's services were unexpectedly sought by a pregnant woman and her husband, who arrived in the village, as strangers, just before she gave birth. The following day the father left, and within a month the mother was carried off by her father, who persuaded Mr Gray to undertake the care and education of the boy, and deposited a thousand pounds in trust for him. Four years afterwards Mrs Gray died in giving birth to a daughter, and the two children were brought up together. At the age of fourteen Richard, who had been led by his nurse to believe himself born to wealth and honour, was informed by his guardian of his real position, and, after consulting with Mr Lawford and his companion Tom Hillary, he decided to remain an inmate of Mr Gray's family as his apprentice, with Hartley as a fellow pupil. As they grew up both the young men fell in love with Menie, and when the doctor proposed that Hartley should become his partner, and endeavour to secure her affections, it transpired that she and Richard were already secretly engaged. Hartley determined to make a voyage to India, and learnt with astonishment that his rival, at the instigation of Hillary, who was now a captain in the Company's service, intended to spend two years there before marrying, in the hope of realising a fortune.

Having obtained the money left by his grandfather in Mr Gray's hands, and enlisted as a recruit, he sailed from [[Edinburgh]] with his friend for the depot at [[Ryde]]; but, on recovering from a drinking bout before landing, he found himself in the military hospital, deserted by Tom Hillary, and robbed of all his belongings. Hartley, however, was acting as one of the medical officers, and, having earned the gratitude of the commandant, General Witherington, by successfully treating two of his children who were suffering from smallpox, was able to obtain a commission for his fellow-student. The general and his wife had discovered that Richard was their first-born, and when he was introduced to them the shock of hearing him describe himself as an orphan, deserted by his parents, caused the death of his mother, upon which the father was seized with a fit of frenzy, and on recovering could not face his son again. Hartley had, however, been previously entrusted with his history, as well as a gift of money for him, and they sailed together for [[Madras]]. Having killed his colonel in a duel, Richard fled to the court of a native prince, while Hartley obtained great reputation as a medical practitioner. One of his patients was Barak el Hadji, who promised him his influence with [[Hyder Ali]], should he at any time need it.

[[File:Bangalore Fort.jpg|thumb|right|Bangalore Fort in 1860]]
Some months afterwards he was startled by the presence of Menie Gray at a public breakfast, chaperoned by the [[Begum]], who, he learnt, was the wealthy widow of a Rajah. At a private interview with his old master's daughter, Hartley elicited from her that she had come out at Richard's invitation to be married, and was on her way to meet him in [[Mysore]]. Mistrusting her lover, he offered his protection should she need it, and the next day he received a note from her telling him she was sold to [[Tippoo Saib]]. Unable to obtain an audience of the governor, Hartley resolved to solicit the intervention of Hyder Ali, and, having reached [[Seringapatam]], he sought the aid of El Hadji, who introduced him to another Fakir of higher rank. Following his directions, he accompanied a troop of native cavalry to Tippoo's encampment near [[Bangalore]], and witnessed his return thither, escorted by a magnificent bodyguard, including artillery and elephants. The Begum, who had previously arrived with her retinue, and Menie under her protection, was at once invited to an interview with the prince in his garden the following day. Accordingly, at noon the discharge of cannon announced that he had left his palace; and on the arrival of his visitor, attended by Richard as her principal officer, she was conducted to a cushion on his right hand. An attendant then proclaimed the appointment of Richard as governor of the city, and the Begum in return presented Tippoo with the litter containing Menie.

The old Fakir, however, came forward, and, throwing off his disguise, ascended the throne as Hyder Ali. Having reproved his son, he commanded him to restore the gift to the care of Hartley, but allowed the ceremony of investiture to proceed. As Richard, however, who had plotted with Paupiah to betray his trust, was about to mount the elephant in waiting for him, the Rajah made a sign, upon which the animal seized him by the neck with its trunk, and crushed him to death with its foot. The Begum was then ordered to bear her share in compensating her intended victim for the indignity she had suffered, and afterwards deprived of her power and riches. Menie returned to her native village, and the gallant Hartley died from a distemper caught in the courageous pursuit of his profession.

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}. The natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in eliciting laughter by releasing tension in acting clumsy or rendering themselves helpless.{{cite journal| last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Devil%2Bclown%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |title=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity.edu|accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624001158/http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

The term was coined in a 2006 study&lt;ref name="Eliminating"&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.120.5440|title=Eliminating the successor to plagiarism? Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=&lt;!-- 2007-05-23 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Thomas Lancaster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html Thomas Lancaster bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206154603/http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html |date=2009-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Clarke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-clarke/16/12a/967 |title=Robert Clarke bio |publisher=Linkedin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Birmingham City University|the University of Central England in Birmingham]] (now known as ''Birmingham City University'').

==Extent==

The first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating is a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster.&lt;ref name="Eliminating" /&gt; The study presented three main findings:

#Over 12 percent of postings on a popular website for outsourcing computer contract work are actually bid requests from students looking to attempt contract cheating.
#Contract cheaters posted an average of 4–7 requests, suggesting that habitual use is made of such services by these students.
#A smaller number of users have posted over 50 bid requests, including examples from multiple institutions. This suggests that these are agencies subcontracting work, not students who are directly making use of the services.

Whereas the quality of solutions to assignments sold by [[essay mill]] has been questioned, a study by Jenkins and Helmore showed that work obtained through the use of an [[Online auction|auction site]] was of sufficient quality to gain good marks and remain undetected by the module [[tutor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/Events/HEADublin2006_V2/papers/Tony%20Jenkins%2023.pdf |format=PDF|title=T. Jenkins and S. Helmore "Coursework for cash: the threat from on-line plagiarism", in Proceedings of 7th Annual Conference for Information and Computer Science, Dublin. Higher Education Academy pp121-126 (August 2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study examined over 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorise the assignment types (e.g. Programming, Database, Web Design) and are analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final year undergraduate and postgraduate) being posted onto auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/8th-annual-conf/Papers/Thomas%20Lancaster%20final.pdf|title=Assessing Contract Cheating Through Auction Sites – A Computing Perspective|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-09-13 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a study of 4,000 suspected cases of "contract cheating" some interesting patterns of behaviour have been observed. A summary was presented at the HEA Workshop on Contract Cheating (March 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/presentations/682_Private%20Life%20Annotated.pdf|title=The Private Life of an Assignment|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2011-01-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Aske conference held in June 2009 a paper detailing a "multi-faceted" approach to dealing with the problem of "contract cheating" was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/documents/Plagiarism09_LancasterClarke.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contract Cheating in UK Higher Education: promoting a proactive approach|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper presented at the STEM conference (April 2012) was a study of over 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from "Anthropology to Theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/stem-conference/Computing%201/Thomas_Lancaster_Robert_Clarke.pdf|title=Dealing with contract cheating: a question of attribution|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2012-04-18|accessdate=2012-05-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commercial Aspects of Contract Cheating are examined in a paper given at ITiCSE '13. This paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462497|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasLancaster/commercial-aspects-of-contract-cheating-iticse-2013|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating (Slides)|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 meta-analysis of 5 studies, 3.5% of a total of 1378 students reported buying assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted doing so more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Guy J.|last2=Clare|first2=Joseph|date=2017-04-20|title=How Prevalent is Contract Cheating and to What Extent are Students Repeat Offenders?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|journal=Journal of Academic Ethics|language=en|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|issn=1570-1727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The assignments prepared by essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', meaning that they are likely to evade detection by software packages such as Turnitin. Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M.J. and Newton P.M. 2014. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2014.889597#.VDj7k1fbGw0 Turnaround time and market capacity in contract cheating]. Educational Studies. 40(2) 233-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection ==
In July 2007 a paper proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4365466|title=Establishing a Systematic Six-Stage Process for Detecting Contract Cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2007-07-26|website=|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract cheating sites often claim this form of cheating is undetectable,&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lines|first=Lisa|date=2016-11-16|title=Ghostwriters guaranteeing grades? The quality of online ghostwriting services available to tertiary students in Australia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|journal=Teaching in Higher Education|volume=21|issue=8|pages=889–914|doi=10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|issn=1356-2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that has been tested in two studies. In a 2016 Australian study, when markers were asked to mark a set of contract cheating assignments and contract cheating was not mentioned to them, no marker raised any concerns of contract cheating.&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"/&gt; However, in a later study when markers were specifically asked to detect it, they correctly identified contract cheating 62% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Phillip|last2=Sutherland-Smith|first2=Wendy|date=2017-06-05|title=Can markers detect contract cheating? Results from a pilot study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|issn=0260-2938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clare|first=Joseph|last2=Walker|first2=Sonia|last3=Hobson|first3=Julia|date=2017-08-08|title=Can we detect contract cheating using existing assessment data? Applying crime prevention theory to an academic integrity issue|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|issn=1833-2595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the Plagiarism across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases where a student committed contract cheating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://plagiarism.pefka.mendelu.cz/files/proceedings_15.pdf |title=Plagiarism detection 2.0: Detection of Contract Cheating |last1=Khan |first1=Wasi |year=2015|publisher= Mendel University|book-title= |pages=215|location=Brno |conference= Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Khan, Wasi (Presenter)| date = Aug 3, 2015| title = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond| medium = Motion picture| language = English | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14f5AnfTy0A | access-date = November 12, 2017| location = Brno, Czech Republic | publisher = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-originality engines (like [[Turnitin]]) are unlikely to detect contract cheating, there has been some success in using them to identify the source of assignments detected on auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/stem-conference-2014/Post_event_resources/Computing/Using_Turnitin|title=Using Turnitin as a tool for attribution in cases of contract cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2014-04-13|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
In general, academic institutions consider contract cheating to be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct and it is penalised accordingly. In 2010 the 'AMBeR Project' developed a UK 'Plagiarism Tariff' in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious penalties available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions considered it to be a separate form of misconduct altogether due to the seemingly obvious intent associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/plagiarism-tariff-let-the-punishment-fit-the-demerit-points/412088.article|title=Plagiarism tariff: let the punishment fit the demerit points|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 research study, also in the UK, asked university students what they thought penalties for academic misconduct should be. The responses demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20205|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/hundreds-fail-to-spot-plagiarism/2019818.article|title=Hundreds fail to spot plagiarism|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199#.VccNJvma5kU|title= Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|accessdate=22 May 2016 | doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199|volume=41|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The legality of contract cheating services was reviewed by Newton and Lang in a 2016 book chapter of the Springer Handbook for Academic Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of these services varies internationally. In [[New Zealand]] it is illegal to "advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat", with similar, older laws on the statutes of 17 states in the US. 

In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|title=Education, deterrence, detection: how to tackle the problem of essay mills|date=2016-08-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919071215/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|archivedate=19 September 2016|work=QAA news}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggesting that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud as they involve 'false representation' and 'failure to disclose information'. A subsequent research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5|title=Are Essay Mills committing fraud? An analysis of their behaviours vs the 2006 Fraud Act (UK)|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the UK Fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that they would be unlikely to fall foul of [[Fraud]] law due to the disclaimers, terms and conditions they use which generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as 'study guides' or 'revision aids', thereby placing responsibility, and 'intent', onto the student client. Despite this,  media 'stings' have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1422913.ece|title=‘£630 and I’ll put you on the way to a first’|date=15 June 2014|author1=Robin Henry|author2=Cal Flyn|author3=Katie Glass|publisher=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7|title=Ethical and legal observations on contract cheating services as an agreement|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of [[Australian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1037969X17710627|title=Contract cheating: Will students pay for serious criminal consequences?|date=18 September 2017|publisher=|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=42|issue=2|pages=123–129|doi=10.1177/1037969x17710627}}&lt;/ref&gt; law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating.

A follow-up research study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5|title=A legal approach to tackling contract cheating?|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed such a new law, based on the principle of [[strict liability]], which lessens the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that they 'intended to help student cheat', but instead would make them liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating.  

More broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely due to the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.

[[File:Neues Museum - Krug mit szenischer Darstellung3.jpg|thumb|Jug with Scenic Decoration, 8th-6th centuries BC. [[Neues Museum]], Berlin]]

'''Cypriot Bichrome ware''' is a type of [[Late Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]], pottery that is found widely on Cyprus and in the Eastern Mediterranean. This type of pottery is found in many sites on Cyprus, in the Levant, and also in Egypt. It was typically produced on a [[pottery wheel]]. A large variety of decorations and motifs are attested. This pottery is very similar to certain types of the [[Mycenaean pottery]] from various locations.

It was originally produced on Cyprus during the Late Cypriot I period. Comparison of the fabrics indicates that it was also imitated in the Eastern Levant and in Egypt.

==Typology==
Cypriot Bichrome is characterized by its most common decoration: two black lines with a red line in between. Between those lines geometric, floral or zoomorphic decorations would often appear.

For a long time, Bichrome Ware was considered to be a key marker for the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. However, recent studies indicate a slightly earlier appearance.

==Chronology==
[[File:Ancient Cypriotic bichrome pottery 750-600 v. Chr. 2. C.jpg|thumb|300px|Bichrome Ware, Archaic I, 750–600 BC, from [[Salamis, Cyprus]]]]

The following periods are distinguished on Cyprus.

*Cypro-Geometric Period (1050–750&amp;nbsp;BC)

This is a wheel-made pottery featuring rich and symmetrical painted decoration of parallel lines, bands, concentric circles, rhombi, checked, meanders, rosettes, lotus flowers, papyruses and various other floral and geometrical motifs.

The Cypro-Geometric period is still not fully understood and is much debated. The main point of contention is the continuity between the end of the Bronze Age and the early Geometric period.

During the Cypro-Geometric I Period (1050–950 BC), the following types of pottery were produced on Cyprus other than the Bichrome: White Painted, Plain White, and Black Slip potteries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120709011915/https://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/Cesnola/MatWaresIAGjerstad.html Gjerstad's Iron Age Pottery Typology &amp; Chronology], Harvard Semitic Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

*Archaic Period (750–475 BC)
This period is distinguished by the jugs of the free field style. They feature unique schematised bichrome type representations of bulls, birds, fishes and additional decorative forms.

*Cypro-Classical Period (475–325 BC)
A type of Bichrome pottery (Bichrome VII) was produced as late as the Cypro-Classical Period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120709011915/https://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/Cesnola/MatWaresIAGjerstad.html Gjerstad's Iron Age Pottery Typology &amp; Chronology], Harvard Semitic Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, the artists of Cyprus were most heavily influenced by the art of mainland Greece, but Cypriot idiosyncrasies, such as the pitchers with figural spouts still existed. The human figure made more regular appearances in art than in previous ages, and sculpture became popular on large and minuscule scales.&lt;ref&gt;The Docent Collections Handbook, 2007: [http://ringlingdocents.org/pages/Gallery20.pdf Geometric and Archaic Art in Cyprus (PDF file)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific analysis==
A noted nuclear scientist [[Isadore Perlman]] undertook the analysis of Cypriot Bichrome Ware when he pioneered high-precision methods of [[neutron activation analysis]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in the US. Neutron activation analysis helps to determine the origin of ancient pottery and other artifacts through the analysis of the clay from which they were made. He was helped in the project by another noted scientist [[Frank Asaro]].

Second millennium BC pottery from Cyprus was one of the first archaeological projects that Perlman and Asaro undertook. This project was chosen because the archaeology for that period in that area was rather confused, and Perlman hoped to add some clarity to the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/iperlman.pdf ISADORE PERLMAN, 1915-1991: A Biographical Memoir by GLENN T. SEABORG AND FRANK ASARO (PDF file).] NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES&lt;/ref&gt;

Aided by the Swedish archaeologist [[Einar Gjerstad]], they obtained 1,200 pottery sherds excavated by the [[Swedish Cyprus Expedition]] in 1927-31. Up until that time, a distinctive type pottery called "Bichrome Ware," first found in [[Tel Ajjul]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by the archaeologist [[Sir Flinders Petrie]], was believed to originate in Palestine. This pottery was very common all over the [[Levant]]. The Berkeley group showed that, in fact, the chemical composition of the pieces matched the composition of Cyprus-made pottery, which meant that these items were later exported to Palestine and other areas, a result that had extensive ramifications on the archaeology of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of the "Palestinian" Bichrome Ware", (with M. Artzy and I. Perlman), J. American Oriental Society 93, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it was found that the fast wheel was used in Cyprus in the second millennium BC (which was not known before). Also, many types of pottery previously believed to have originated in [[Ras Shamra]], [[Lebanon]], had actually been made in Cyprus.

'''Devil's doors''' are structural features found in the north wall of some [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] and older churches in the United Kingdom.  They are particularly common in the historic county of [[Sussex]], where more than 40 extant churches have one.&lt;ref name="Collins52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collins|2007|p=52.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have their origins in the early Christian era, when pre-Christian worship was still popular, and were often merely symbolic structures—although they were sometimes used as genuine entrances.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"&gt;{{Harvnb|Piccardi|Masse|2007|p=291.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
[[File:St Nicholas Church, Worth, Crawley.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon-era]] [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth|St Nicholas' Church]] at [[Worth, West Sussex]], has a Devil's door]]

Before and during the [[Middle Ages]], the north face of a church was considered to belong to the Devil and to people considered [[Paganism|heathen]].&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppin138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coppin|2006|p=138.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Churches were invariably built to the north of roads and tracks, to ensure their main entrance was on the south side.&lt;ref name="Coppin138"/&gt;  It was also common for them to be [[Christianised sites|built on pre-Christian sacred sites]].  Such places were still considered sacred by their former worshippers, who would often continue to visit them.  A doorway would often be inserted in the "heathen" north side of the church to allow them to enter and worship on the site.  Because of the association of that side with the Devil, the name "Devil's door" became established.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;

A later, and more common purpose, (especially in Sussex) was to allow the Devil to escape from the church.  A widespread belief in the Middle Ages held that the Devil resided in an unbaptised child's [[soul]]; at the [[baptism]], the Devil would be driven out of the child and had to be able to leave.  Accordingly, a door was often built into the north wall for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;  These doors were often too small to have any real use, and were therefore only figurative.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;  Most of the doors that remain have been bricked up—reputedly to prevent the Devil re-entering.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:St Margaret's Church, Ditchling.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church, Ditchling, Devil's door]]

Devil's doors can be found throughout Britain, but they are concentrated in Sussex: churches in that county with visible examples include [[St Margaret's Church, Ditchling]]; [[St Peter's Church, Hamsey]]; [[St Helen's Church, Hangleton]]; [[All Saints Church, Patcham]]; [[Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting|St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting]]&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt; and [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmes|1920|loc=Unpaginated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">'''Ecological Building''' is both a design process and the structure that is a result of such a design process. 

The Ecological Building design process is a modern architecture variant of [[permaculture]] design. 

An Ecological Building is a structure that is ''designed to create and sustain mutually beneficial relationships with all of the elements of its local [[ecology]]''.  A building's local ecology, or environment, is made up of particular physical and biological elements and their interactions.

The [[abiotic]], or physical elements are defined by the local [[geology]] and the local [[climate]].  The local geology is defined by the soil type, [[substrata (gardening)|substrata]], local [[land use]], and water patterns of the site and its surroundings.  The local climate is made up of the weather patterns, wind patterns, solar patterns, and pollution patterns for the site and its surroundings.

The [[biotic material|biotic]] or living elements are all of the local [[species]] and local [[ecosystems]] - including humans and urban ecologies - that interact with the site.

This concept is distinctly different from [[green building]], or [[sustainable architecture]] where the goal is to "minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings".&lt;ref&gt;[[sustainable architecture]] ''Wikipedia'' August 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological building is a positive design goal that sets out to increase beneficial interactions, whereas green building is a negative design outlook that seeks only the reduction of negative interactions.  Inherent in green building is the assumption that any human interaction with a site is unavoidably negative, and that mitigating these negative impacts is the best that is possible. With Ecological Building, the designer acknowledges that humans can play an integral, beneficial role in improving and sustaining the health and vitality of their local ecology.

'''Feather tights''' is the name usually given by art historians to a form of costume seen on [[Late Medieval]] depictions of angels, which shows them as if wearing a body suit with large scale-like overlapping downward-pointing elements representing feathers, as well as having large wings.  Other sources use '''feathered angels''' to describe the style. The style is assumed to derive from actual costumes worn by those playing angels in medieval religious drama, with the "feathered" elements presumably flaps or [[lappet]]s of cloth or leather sewn onto a body suit.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 168; Plate 10.1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GgsSKtb9iRwC&amp;pg=PA144 here shows a modern production at York] attempting to recreate the effect, sadly with very baggy suits.&lt;/ref&gt;  The feathers on angels in art can often to be seen to stop abruptly at the neck, wrists and ankles, sometimes with a visible hemline, reflecting these originals.&lt;ref&gt;As for example on the Holy Thorn Reliquary; Tait 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Magdalene's hair suit''' is another iconographic feature, with a background in hagiographic legend, whose depiction apparently borrows from religious drama.

Historians of English churches tend to refer to the feather tights style as 15th century, and by implication essentially English,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= fowler&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first = Harold North | title = A History of Sculpture | year =2005 | location = | publisher = Kessinger | isbn = 978-1-4179-6041-5 |page =237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be seen in several major late medieval European works from the late 14th to early 16th centuries.  These include the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made by a court goldsmith in Paris in the 1390s,&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 43&lt;/ref&gt; and on two wooden angels from South Germany around 1530 ([[Museum Kunstpalast]] [[Düsseldorf]], right), as well as two stone ones hovering over the ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] at [[Maidbronn]] (1526), and others on [[Veit Stoss]]'s wooden [[altarpiece]] at [[Bamberg Cathedral]] (1520–23).&lt;ref&gt;Mellinkoff, 22; Kahrsniz and Bunz, 405&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a figure with greenish-black feathers, in [[Matthias Grünewald]]'s [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] of 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Russell; until Mellinkoff's book largely on this figure, he was often taken to be the [[Archangel Michael]], as [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQvRh-Z1cfEC&amp;pg=PA167 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "devil in his feathers" featured in the [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]] as late as the 1590s, provided by the butcher's [[guild]]; these parades had originally used the costumes from the [[Chester Plays]],&lt;ref&gt;F.

(Norwich or Durham?)" in the "3rd quarter of the 14th century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8780&amp;CollID=28&amp;NStart=1894 Egerton Genesis Picture Book] or MS Egerton 1894, British Library; see Joslin, Mary Coker and Carolyn Coker Joslin Watson.

==Context==
[[File:Matthias Grünewald - Concert of Angels (detail) - WGA10740.jpg|thumb|left|Feathered "[[Lucifer]]", [[Isenheim Altarpiece]], 1515]]
It is believed that this practice arose from medieval [[liturgical drama]]s and [[mystery play]]s, in which the actors portraying angels wore garments covered with feathers to emphasize their power of flight,&lt;ref name = coe/&gt; often standing on "clouds" of wool.&lt;ref name= anderson&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Mary Désirée | title = The Medieval Carver | year = 1935 | location = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costumed angels also might be introduced for one-off special occasions: at the coronation of Henry VII's queen, [[Elizabeth of York]], in 1487 an angel swinging a large [[censer]] was lowered from the roof of [[Old St Paul's]], and at the marriage of their son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in 1501, the [[archangel Raphael]] was part of the ceremony, with "goldyn and glyteryng wingis and ffedyrs of many and sundry colours".&lt;ref&gt;Roof angels&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathering might be used as a substitute for other clothing, or under [[vestment]]s or [[Saint Michael]]'s armour.&lt;ref name= rush&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushforth | first =Gordon McNeil  | title = Medieval Christian imagery: as illustrated by the painted windows of Great Malvern Priory Church, Worchestershire, together with a description and explanation of all the ancient glass in the church | year = 1936 | location = | publisher = The Clarendon Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feathered tights are not to be confused with the feathers of the extra pairs of wings traditionally attributed to [[cherubim]] and other higher [[Christian angelic hierarchy|orders of angels]], which are often shown pointing downwards covering the legs.  Further enhancements to actor's costumes might include expensive real [[peacock]] feathers to represent the "eyed" wing feathers of the [[cherubim]];&lt;ref name= coe&gt;{{cite book | last = Coe | first = Brian | title = Stained glass in England, 1150-1550 | year = 1981| location = | publisher = W.H.

The more common and traditional angelic costume of an [[alb]]-like robe flowing to the feet was also used in drama, as records show.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary Magdalene's hair suit==
[[File:Mary Magdalene 01.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of altarpiece by [[Jan Polack]], c. 1500]]
A similar depiction of the penitent [[Mary Magdalene]] appears in some Southern German works around mostly 1500, but with body hair rather than feathers. The earliest may be in the scene of Mary's last [[Holy Communion]] in [[Lucas Moser]]'s Altar with scenes from the life of the Magdalene in [[Tiefenbronn]], from 1432.  [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s carved figure in the [[Münnerstadt]] Altar (1490-1492), now [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]], Munich is the best known.  According to medieval legend the Magdalene had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a prostitute and her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of [[Saint Mary of Egypt]], a 4th-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert.  In earlier medieval depictions Mary's long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty, but in these her hair is more naturalistic and does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;Witcombe, 279, 282; Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead she has a coat of hair somewhat like a dog's, ending rather neatly at the neck, wrists and ankles, suggesting derivation from a theatrical costume, as with the feather suits. The suits, which are mainly consistent in depiction, do not cover her breasts or knees, or sometimes elbows.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;  The bare patches on the knees and elbows probably are meant to have been worn bare by Mary praying on her knees, resting her elbows on a rock ledge, as she is often shown in later paintings of the Penitent Magdalen. The lack of hair on the breasts presumably follows the pattern of body hair typical of mammals and familiar to late medieval Germans from farm animals such as sheep and cattle.

Most such images depict the "Ascension" or ''Elevation of Mary Magdalene'', showing the regular visits of angels to Mary's desert home (actually in [[Provence]] in the South of France according to the legend) to raise her into the air and feed her heavenly food.  In the words of [[William Caxton]]'s English translation of the ''[[Golden Legend]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the blessed Mary Magdalene, desirous of sovereign contemplation, sought a right sharp desert, and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God, and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody. In which place she had no comfort of running water, ne solace of trees, ne of herbs. And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly, that he had ordained for her refection celestial, and no bodily meats. And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels, and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears. Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats, and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place, in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing.&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Mary Magdalen", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume4.asp#Mary%20Magdalene "Life of Mary Magdalen"], [[William Caxton]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moser's altar shows the scene of her last [[Holy Communion]] after her return to the world and just before her death, as recounted in the ''Golden Legend'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... [Saint [[Maximin of Trier|Maximinus]]] saw the blessed Mary Magdalene standing in the quire or choir yet among the angels that brought her, and was lift up from the earth the space of two or three cubits. And praying to our Lord she held up her hands, and when S. Maximin saw her, he was afraid to approach to her. And she returned to him, and said: Come hither mine own father, and flee not thy daughter. And when he approached and came to her, as it is read in the books of the said S. Maximin, for the customable vision that she had of angels every day, the cheer and visage of her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the sun. And then all the clerks and the priests aforesaid were called, and Mary Magdalene received the body and blood of our Lord of the hands of the bishop with great abundance of tears, and after, she stretched her body tofore the altar, and her right blessed soul departed from the body and went to our Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Caxton, as previous passage quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[relief]] panels on the inside of the shutters of the Münnerstadt Altar show four scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, with her covered in body hair in the last two, showing her last Communion and burial (these are still in the church).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 93-95; [[:File:Münnerstadt, St Maria Magdalena 008.JPG|Image, also with replica main statue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinz Warneke''' (June 30, 1895 – 1983) American sculptor, best remembered as an [[animalier]]. His "''role in the [[direct carving]] movement assured him a place in the annals of Twentieth Century American sculpture.''" &lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Mary Mullen, ‘’Heinz Warneke (1895–1983): A Sculptor First and Last'', University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 1994 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 Heinz received the [[Widener Gold Medal]] for his sculpture ''Wild Boars''.

==Biography==
The artist was born Heinrich Johann Dietrich Warneke in [[Hagen bei Leeste]], a small village near [[Bremen, Germany]] and pursued his art studies at the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGlauflin, Alice Coe, editor, ''Who’s Who in American Art: Volume II, 1938–1939'', The American Federation of Arts, Inc., Washington D.C., 1937. p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; There his teachers included [[Karl Blossfeldt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Mary Mullen, ‘’Heinz Warneke (1895–1983): A Sculptor First and Last'', University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 1994 p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, Warneke was a member of the German Monuments Commission but later moved to New York in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/w/warneke_h.htm|title = Heinz Warneke Papers|date = |accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = Syracuse University Libraries|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the years 1927–1932 in Paris creating a social realism, art-deco and primitivism sculptural style. When he returned to the United States, Warneke undertook multiple commissions for the [[Works Progress Administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He shared his skills with young art students by teaching sculpture at various institutions. From 1943 to 1968, Warneke taught in Washington, D.C. at the [[George Washington University]] and the [[Corcoran School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=5236|title = Heinz Warneke|date = |accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = National Museum of American Art|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding history==
[[Peter Kneebone]] proposed the idea to establish an international organisation for graphic design and was involved in Icograda's founding.&lt;ref name="Muesuem of London"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/festival/kneebone.htm | title=The Festival of Britain | publisher=Museum of London | date=2001-09-10 | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Industrial Artists (which changed its name in 1963 to the Society of Industrial Artists &amp; Designers, and is now the Chartered Society of Designers, or CSD) set up a working group under the chairmanship of [[Willy de Majo]], to promote the creation of an organisation to represent internationally the many professional graphic design associations throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/willy-de-majo-archive | title=Willy de Mayo Archive | publisher=University of Brighton Faculty of Arts | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such organisation existed. The profession was rapidly growing in importance, and also attempting to clarify its identity and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; It was involved in increasingly complex social and technological situations. National associations were developing, but international dialogue and action were intermittent and uncoordinated. It was important to create links between the professional associations in all countries, and between the profession and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;W.M. de Mayo, 1990. 'A vision realized'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary''&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural conference of Icograda took place at Watney House, London, from 26–28 April 1963, attended by delegates from 28 associations in 17 European countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"&gt;Peter Kneebone, 1990. 'Icograda: reflections on a history'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was chaired by [[Henri Kay Henrion|H.K. Henrion]] and supported by Kneebone as secretary. On 27 April, the meeting agreed to formally establish Icograda. Proposals that were ratified include the development and drafts of a ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', a ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers'', ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', an ''International Directory of Organizations Concerned with Graphic Design'' and the publication of a News Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990.

The first Executive Board was elected at the meeting in London, composed of Willy de Majo (Great Britain, President), [[Wim Crouwel|Wim H. Crouwel]] (The Netherlands, Secretary General), Martin Gavier (Sweden, Treasurer), Peter Hatch (Great Britain, Vice President), Hans Neuburg (Switzerland, Vice President), Jukka Pellinen (Finland, Vice President), D. Stojannovic-Sip (Yugoslavia, Vice President), John Tandy (Great Britain, Member), Pieter Brattinga (The Netherlands, Member) and Paul Schwarz (The Netherlands, Honorary Treasurer). This Executive Board served from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same meeting, the first Icograda Congress and General Assembly in 1964 in Zurich was called in order to establish the aims and structures upon which the future of the organisation rested.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990.

On 27 April 2013, Icograda celebrated its 50th anniversary and its 25th General Assembly.&lt;ref name="50thAnniversary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/events/calendar1081.htm |title=25 Icograda General Assembly: Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=Icograda |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and activities==

===1960s===
The first Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in 1964 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm | title=Congress History | publisher=Icograda | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by about 200 designers from 17 countries and 23 associations. The theme of the Congress was Commercial Artist or Graphic Designer".&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt; The Congress opened with the reading of a message by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] who wrote: “Every day designers of all kinds are becoming responsible for a greater proportion of man's environment. Almost everything that we see and use that was not made by the Almighty has come from some designer's drawing board. This is a very heavy responsibility and every effort by designers to improve standards, to encourage proper training and to develop a sense of social awareness is to be welcomed.”&lt;ref&gt;The original letter is housed at the Icograda Archive, University of Brighton&lt;/ref&gt; At the General Assembly, delegates Icograda's aims and objectives, and it was further agreed to establish an audio-visual archive and library, to publish a news bulletin and to award student scholarships. Jenny Toynbee from Edinburgh School of Art won the first student scholarship. Ernest Hoch's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/obit.html |title=The optimism of modernity : documents |publisher=Optimism-modernity.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/hoch-catalogue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/metric-typo/hoch77.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposals for a unified system of typographic measurement was accepted for further development.

In 1965 Icograda establishes the Signs and Symbols Commission. It first collaborates closely with the International Chamber of Commerce and then with the [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]. In the same year Icograda publishes ''Graphic journalism: Catalogue of Magazines and Annuals of Graphic Design and Allied Subjects'' featuring around 300 journals from 30 countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt;

In April 1966 the first Icograda International Student Project was judged in Belgrade. The theme was 'Public information signs' and the jury included Abram Games, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Paul Rand, Masaru Katzumie and Ivan Picelj.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hitchins, 2013, ''An Icograda love story'', article to be published in November 2013 as part of the Icograda Legacy Initiative collection&lt;/ref&gt; The second Icogarada Congress, 'Graphic Design and Visual Communication Technology', and General Assembly were then held from 11–16 July 1966 in Bled, then in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm |title=Congress History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buckminster Fuller|R Buckminster Fuller]] was one of the main speakers at the Congress. At the General Assembly, four key policy documents were ratified: ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', the ''Honorarium for Judges of International Competitions'' document and the revised ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', and the ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers''. [[:no:Knut Yran|Knut Yran]], head of design at Phillips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.philips.com/about/design/aboutus/designheritage/index.page |title=Philips - Design - Our design heritage |publisher=Design.philips.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Eindhoven, was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] from the Netherlands, Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory" /&gt; The first student seminar was also held in Bled from 11–13 July 1966 and the theme was 'Breaking the Language Barrier with Signs and Symbols'. In addition, the production of ''Equality of Man'', a film project for students and young people in support of the United Nations Human Rights Year, was the first of several Icograda collaborations with [http://asifa.net/ International Animated Film Association (ASIFA)]

The third Icograda Congress 'Design Destinations in a Changing World' was held in 1968 in Eindhoven.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory" /&gt; An exhibition of Belgian graphics was organised by Michel Olyff at the same time and the entire congress decamped to Brussels for a day. "Sachez que tout en ce monde n’est que signes et signes de signes" (beware that all in the world is only signs and signs of signs), were the words of Marcel Schwab quoted by Alderman van der Harten in opening the congress. Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, "but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Icograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political émigrés who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.

At the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.

===1970s===
In 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that "the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week."

The first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.

In 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.

In 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.

In 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from Düsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.

In 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.

The 1977 Zurich Congress − 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' − was complimented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne − 'A Town and its Image' − and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.

In 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef Müller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar − 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'

===1980s===
In 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. In the same year, ''World design sources directory 1980 = Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getcited.org/pub/101980835 |title=(1980) World design sources directory 1980: Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980 |publisher=Getcited.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Centre de Creation Industrielle, was published on behalf of Icograda and ICSID.

The first Icograda, ICSID and IFI Joint Congress took place in Helsinki from 1–8 August 1981, an event that had been under discussion since 1977. The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''. Also in 1981, Icograda organised a poster competition on behalf of UNESCO to celebrate the International Year of Disabled Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32403&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO.ORG &amp;#124; International Year of Disabled Persons |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000483/048396eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the first of six issues of ''icographic/volume 2'' was published on behalf of Icograda by Mobilia Press, with Jorge Frascara as associate editor. Each issue was devoted to a single theme and abstracts were included in four languages. Also in 1982, Haig David-West organised the first African regional meeting in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and in 1983, Haig David-West (the first ever elected Icograda Executive board member from Africa)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; edited the publication ''Dialogue on graphic design problems in Africa'', based on this meeting.

In 1983 the 10th General Assembly and Icograda Congress '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Design Interaction''' were held in Dublin.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The keynote address was given by [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] of the United Nations. In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where "I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable – the only answer".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating "rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to – but in that order – literacy"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; he called on the delegates to "offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see – literally see – both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said "I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task... History will once again make its awesome judgement of you – but from now on with greater respect because you cannot any longer be underestimated. You help all of us perceive and place ourselves in life. Now you must help all of us understand so that we can more wisely and assuredly manage all our futures".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Raymond Kyne was elected President&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and Robert Blaich won the President's Award for his promotion of Icograda-Philips design award.&lt;ref name="icograda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1920.htm |title=President's Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of member organisations had by grown to 50. A multidisciplinary design competition on the theme of ''Shu/Collectivity'', held under the auspices of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and sponsored by the Japan Design Foundation, was won by Charles Owen from the Illinois Institute of Technology.

In 1985, the 11th Icograda Congress ''The place and influence of graphic design in everyday life'' was organised by Philippe Gentil&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; in Nice, the first time that there were major presentations from India ('design without designers' by people whose needs were too urgent to await intervention by professionals) and Australia (from boomerang to bicentenary); from the design of books in China to street signs in Buenos Aires, and provocatively 'the backside of design' – what happens after the consultant has moved on to new, more rewarding problems. According to Stephen Hitchins (Icograda board member from 1987−1991),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ivan Chermayeff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgstudionyc.com/about-us/ivan-chermayeff |title=Ivan Chermayeff &amp;#124; Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv |publisher=Cgstudionyc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a long presentation totally devoid of visuals stating that he "wanted graphics to grow up" – comparing much of it "to WC Fields' definition of a virgin: a child about four years old, extremely ugly". So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, "a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over. At the 11th Icograda General Assembly (also in Nice) [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] was elected president. The President's Trophy went to Jan Railich, the chairman of the Brno Biennale.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Also in 1985, the ''World Directory of Design Schools and Programmes'' was published jointly by Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and edited by Maarten Regouin, secretary of the Icograda Education Working Group, which also coincided with Icograda's establishment of the Design History and Design Management working groups chaired by Michael Twyman and Abe Rosenfeld respectively.

In 1986 Icograda Excellence Awards were made for the first time at the Brno and Warsaw Biennales. The recipients were Christof Gassner and Henryk Tomaszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1922.htm |title=Excellence Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Amrik Kalsi, [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] and Peter Kneebone organised the ''Graphic Design for Development Seminar'' on behalf of Icograda and UNESCO. It was hosted in Nairobi, Kenya, from 6–10 July and attracted 91 participants from 14 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000833/083352eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/feature/current/articles1127.htm?query_page=1 |title=GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR DEVELOPMENT - PART 1 OF 2 |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID, IFI ''Design 87'' − with as its theme 'Design Response' − was held in Amsterdam from 16–20 August 1987.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the 12th Icograda General Assembly which took place from 21–22 August (also in Amsterdam), Niko Spelbrink was elected president and Mary V. Mullin became Secretary-General (and Director of the Icograda Secretariat – a position she held until 1999).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Susumu Sakane was awarded the President's Trophy.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Uwe Loesch won the first Icograda Excellence Award to be presented at the Lahti Biennale. Icograda published the ''History of Design Bibliography'' edited by [[Victor Margolin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~victor/index.html |title=victor's home page |publisher=Tigger.uic.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Projects in Graphic Design Education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frascara-noel.net/publications3.html |title=Publications |publisher=FrascaraNoel |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara.

In 1988, Nils Tvengsberg organised a special event in Oslo, from 13–15 May, to mark the 25th anniversary of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; All 11 presidents from 1963-onwards attended together with many former board members, partners, friends and supporters. It coincided with Norway's national day and according to Stephen Hitchins, "it was one of the more remarkable Icograda events in a history of remarkable events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list276 |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Nils Tvengsberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list372.htm |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to serve on the boards of both Icograda and ICSID simultaneously. His goal was to look at the possibility of joining their common interests. It would be over 20 years before this partnership, the International Design Alliance (IDA), would be headquartered in Montreal, contemplating the first IDA joint congress in 2011.

In 1989 the 13th Congress took place at Tel Aviv University, chaired by Abe Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The theme was 'Graphic Design Through High Technology?' At the General Assembly Simon de Hartog won the President's Award,&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; and Helmut Langer became President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Graphic Design, World Views. A celebration of ICOGRADA’s 25th Anniversary'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jdExAQAAIAAJ | title = Graphic design, world views: A celebration of Icograda's 25th anniversary | isbn = 9780870119002 | author1 = Frascara | first1 = Jorge | last2 = Associations | first2 = International Council of Graphic Design | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara, designed by Niko Spelbrink, and with a cover designed by [[Grapus]], was published jointly by Icograda and Kodansha, a major book on graphic design that celebrated Icograda's 25th anniversary.

The Icograda Foundation was established in 1991 for the advancement of worldwide understanding and education through the effective use of graphic design. A limited company, the Foundation was a registered charity funded by corporate sponsorships, individual donations, legacies, and various fundraising activities. Mary Mullin received the President's Award for her work in establishing the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles149.htm |title=Foundation |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comdevelopment Ltd |url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/the-icograda-foundation |title=The Icograda Foundation of HP4 3NE in Berkhamsted Hertfordshire |publisher=Companiesintheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/1003880 |title=Icograda Foundation |publisher=OpenCharities |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the 14th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in Montréal, from 25–29 August, attended by around 2,000 delegates.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the Icograda General Assembly (30–31 August 1991), [[Giancarlo Iliprandi]] was elected president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Highlights of the Assembly included: the hosting of the 3rd Marijke Singer Memorial Lecture presented by Margaret Catley Carlson, entitled ''Images for the Next Century''; the Icograda President's Award was bestowed on Mary V. Mullin for the inauguration of the Icograda Foundation and the Friends of Icograda;&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; establishment of the Icograda World Graphic Design Day;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/worlddesignday.htm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; World Communication Design Day |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishment of Icograda Steering Committee for the International Design Archive and Research Centre Project; and the establishment of Icograda Friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/categories/articles125.htm |title=Friends |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with seed donations contributed by 68 Japanese founders, chaired by Hiroshi Kojitani. In the same year, the first ''Icograda/IFI/ICSID Joint Newsletter'' was published.

In 1993 the 3rd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID and IFI was held in Glasgow, Ireland from 5–9 September.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Stephen Hitchins chaired the organising committee and there were 101 speakers and over 1,000 delegates. [[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been “the most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years”. Jeremy Myerson called it "a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, "Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is [[Yuri Soloviev]]'s story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it − keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

From 23–27 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto. The theme of the Congress was ''Shifting Frontiers''. At the 16th Icograda General Assembly, Jose Korn Bruzzone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/media/releases/articles911.htm |title=Jose Korn Bruzzone to Deliver Education Keynote at Icograda World Design Congress 2007 |publisher=Icograda |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Chile became President and the Icograda President's Award was presented to Marion Wesel-Henrion and J.

In 1996, Icograda released a policy document ''Digital Immortality: Encapsulating the Work of the World's Top 20th Century Designers for an Icograda Archive in digital form'' aimed to establish a comprehensive archive for Icograda and the work of leading graphic design masters. In the same year, Icograda participated in a meeting of the Icograda/ICSID/IFI working group founded to develop closer working relations between the three organisations which took place from 7–8 December in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The 17th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place from 21–23 October in Punte del Este, Uruguay.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; This was the first Icograda Congress to be hosted in the Southern Hemisphere and attracted ±1 000 delegates. The Congress theme was 'INTERCAMBIOS/EXCHANGES'. At this General Assembly in Punte del Este, the Icograda Assembly joined the ICSID and IFI General Assemblies to unanimously pass a resolution which called for closer contact between the "three sisters," paving the path towards the formation of the International Design Alliance (IDA), which was eventually established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |title=International Design Alliance |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528090348/http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy-A Schockaert from Belgium became President and Mary V. Mullin was again elected Secretary General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In early 1999, Mary V. Mullin resigned as the Icograda Secretary General and Director of the Icograda Secretariat after serving 12 years in the position. The Secretariat relocated from London to Brussels under the new leadership of Thierry van Kerm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thierry-van-kerm/6/609/13a |title=Thierry Van Kerm |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was appointed as Icograda Director in June of the same year.

''Sydney Design 99: Viewpoints in Time'', the 4th joint Icograda/ICSID/IFI Congress took place from 26–29 September in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Around 1 400 delegates from 45 countries attended the event. The 18th Icograda General Assembly followed immediately after the Congress, 30 September-1 October in Sydney. At the Assembly, David Grossman from Israel become President and Martha Bateman from South Africa was elected as Secretary General (Bateman was only the second person from Africa to serve on the Executive Board and the first to serve in a senior position). At this GA the Council officially separated the positions of Secretary General and Director of the Secretariat (paid position) functions.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the 19th Icograda General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the GA ratified a Joint motion of Icograda, ICSID and IFI to establish Design for the World. The Icograda President's Award was presented to Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO for the organisation's long track-record in supporting Icograda's activities.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

===2000s===
At the 17th Icograda General Assembly a motion was ratified to hold a special millennium congress in October 2000 in Seoul, South Korea. The theme was ''Oullim'', meaning 'great harmony'. The event was attended by around 1,600 delegates and was also the first Icograda event to be webcast live on the Internet. The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.

In 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15–16 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.

In March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting. Smaller versions of the ''Design Perspectives'' seminar were also hosted in Victoria, Canada, as well as in Seattle, USA. The Icograda Design Week in Brno took place from 17–21 June in the Czech Republic. The event included ''Over the fence: Design in Central and Eastern Europe'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar, a Regional Meeting attended by delegates from eight countries, the ''Identity/Integrity Icograda Conference'', ''East Meets West, Icograda Student Workshop'', a symposium and inauguration of the Icograda Education Network (IEN) and a workshop to conceptualise the formation of the International Design Media Network (IDMN). The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.

In September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.

The year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.

In January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members’ interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.

The ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8–11 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003−2005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.

In January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey. The Week's programme included ''6 Alfabe, Icograda Student Workshop'', an IEN Symposium, Regional Meeting, ''Building Bridges: Icograda Design Conference'', ''Design Perspectives Icograda Regional Design Seminar'', as well as the launch of the Icograda Design Media Network (IDMN). This was followed by the Icograda Design Week in São Paulo, Brazil, in April of the same year. The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations’ Secretariates to Montreal.

In January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport – Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.

''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.

In 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks. In January, ''So Tiny, So Many: Icograda Design Week in Hong Kong'' took place in China and consisted of a student workshop, an evening lecture series and a Regional Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1025.htm |title=2006 - HONG KONG (CHINA) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, ''Defining design on a changing planet: Icograda Design Week in Seattle'', took place in the USA.

==Tales and myths of impalement==

===Europe===

====Vampires and other undead====
The idea that the vampire "can ''only'' be slain with a stake driven through its heart" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]] and the more recent [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]] and [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] series' all incorporate that idea.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity claim and example:[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155602/Vampire-skeletons-impaled-iron-stakes-say-arent-just-film-fantasy.html Thought vampires were just film fantasy? Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise]&lt;/ref&gt; In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, ''among several'', to "kill" a [[vampire]], or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In one story, an [[Istria]]n peasant named [[Jure Grando]] died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was [[decapitation|decapitated]], and the vampire terror was put to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Caron'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a [[vrykolakas]]. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementshealthspace.com/masthead/ Bio on Cronkite]&lt;/ref&gt; describes an odd grave found at [[Mytilene]], at [[Lesbos]], a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronkite''(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse [[draugr]], or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/[[tumulus|tumuli]]. The approved methods of killing a draugr are "to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes".&lt;ref&gt;''Andrews'' (1913), p.603. Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. [[Edward Payson Evans]] tells the following story, from the city [[Kadaň]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Evans'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=delFlcGFniYC&amp;pg=PA196 p.196]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|In 1337, a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the villages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and murdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep him in his grave, a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: "You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk"}}

====Literary treatment of impalement====
A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of impalement in book can be accessed here: [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Bridge+on+the+Drina+%28excerpts%29.-a0165021314 The Bridge on the Drina]&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans.html A Reader's Guide to the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anecdotes of the impaled====
Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to [[Saint Barbara]]. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.
All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to ''de-impale'' himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Vierholz'' (1737) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrY_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 p.&amp;nbsp;493–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.&lt;ref&gt;''Damengesellschaft'' (1785) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3pMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.&amp;nbsp;95–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In [[British Columbia]], a folk tale from the [[Lillooet people|Lillooet People]] is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.&lt;ref&gt;The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. ''Teit'' (1912), p. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among tribes living around the [[Titicaca]], tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the [[Incas]], a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandelier'' (1904), impalement incident at p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of al-Hallaj===
The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as "I am God". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance "I am God" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like "I am God". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.Soc. Bombay (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=12soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111–113]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he ''does'', however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case.&lt;ref&gt;''Cantemir'' (1734), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, under [[Murad IV]] (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship, ''Browne'' (1751) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=248&amp;id=XjYLAAAAYAAJ p.248]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherwood, Jones'' (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=722&amp;id=8esTAAAAIAAJ p.722]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under [[Mustafa II]]: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Percy'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0k4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian sub-continent===
In the Hindu [[Draupadi]] cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=diPh4qYtjPUC The Cult of Draupadi]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Shaivite]] story from India, under the old [[Pandyan Dynasty]], ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King [[Koon Pandiyan]] had 8000 [[Jainism|Jains]] [[Impalement of the Jains in Madurai|impaled in Madurai]]. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sastri|1976|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roy|1984|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in "lurid mural representations" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paul Dundas|Dundas]]'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C p.127] The author mentions as an example the temple to the war god [[Murugan]] in [[Kalugumalai]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai]], around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of [[Meenakshi]]. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''AES'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybyzrkuQaUEC&amp;pg=PA52 p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name [[Chennai]]), for example, the walls "are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey." ''Elliot'' (1869), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NRISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109] This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the [[Pala Empire]], Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the [[Wise Men of Gotham]], bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter]]'' (1875) [https://archive.org/details/astatisticalacc00unkngoog p.313]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the [[Arthashastra]] states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire "by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (1922), p.422&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Or if invisibility is desired, having fasted three nights one should, on the day of the star Pushya, sprinkle with the milk of goats and sheep, barley planted in soil placed in the skull of a man who has been killed by a sword or has been impaled.}}
The [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Mandavya]], when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord [[Yama]], the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as [[Vidura]], the son of a mere serving maid.&lt;ref&gt;Combined from two slightly variant accounts, ''Ward'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294–95] and ''Garbe'' (1913), p. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A tale from [[Kashmir]] of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: "To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with [[Yogini]]s (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and "lustful for a man", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and "spent the rest of the night sporting with him". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as [[Aryaraja]], and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown'' (1919), p. 425–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Asia===
In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as [[John Bowring]] relates from [[Siam]], those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=306&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.306]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale popular in Siam was about [[Devadatta]], a wily antagonist to [[Buddha]] seeking to undermine [[Gautama]]'s position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the [[Avici]], being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=313&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.313] For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in [[Cambodia]], see ''Vincent Jr.'' (1878), p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusions of impalement==
The 1980 Italian film, ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]], graphically depicts impalement.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sergio&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the "impaled" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the [[special effect]] was done: the actress sat on a [[bicycle seat]] mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of [[balsa]] wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=sergio/&gt;

In stage magic, the ''[[Impaled (illusion)|illusion of impalement]]'' is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/impaled.html Impaled]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some [[dervish]] orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at [[Basra]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Pinkerton'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HWEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 p.172]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The scene was in the open air, and in the court of the mosque, which was illuminated with only three lamps. Several Mullahs and dervises began with singing some passages out of the Koran. They continued to sing, with the accompaniment of some drums; and, during the music, the other dervises arose, took the sharp pointed irons, and did as if they were piercing their bodies, and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh. Next appeared the principal actor, who, assuming an air of inspiration, directed the music to proceed, and to be raised to higher animation, in, order to assist his enthusiasm, or rather to stun the ears of the spectators. In his extacy, he threw up his turban in the air, loosened his hair; for this order of dervises wear their hair; and pierced his body with five lances: then mounting upon a low building, upon which a pole, sixteen feet long, and shod with a sharp iron point, had been set up, he impaled himself upon the pole, and was carried in this condition through the square. It was an affecting sight, to see a lean man, with a long beard, and dishevelled hair, wounded all over with spikes, and then carried about spitted upon a pole. I said, as I went away, to a Mullah of my acquaintance, that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers. The Mullah replied, that he had suspected some such art, but avoided mentioning his suspicions, lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of [[Sheikh Bedreddin|Bed-reddin]]; for that one of his brethren had experienced great persecution from those dervises, in consequence of presuming to hint his doubts of the reality of their miracles."}}

'''Johann Friedrich Herbart''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁbaʁt|lang}}; 4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and founder of [[pedagogy]] as an academic discipline.

Herbart is now remembered amongst the [[post-Kantian]] philosophers mostly as making the greatest contrast to [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]—in particular in relation to [[aesthetics]].

==Life==
Herbart was born on 4 May 1776 in [[Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up as a fragile child because of an unfortunate accident, Herbart was taught by his mother at home until the age of 12. He continued his schooling at the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' for six years, and showed interest in philosophy, logic and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] work involving the nature of knowledge obtained from experience with reality. His education then continued at [[University of Jena|Jena]], whereupon he studied philosophy and came to disagree with his teacher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] precisely because Fichte had taught him to think in a logical manner. He composed a few essays, which he had given to Fichte during his years at Jena, criticising the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and advocating his contention for the [[German idealism]] promoted by others like Kant at the time.

Leaving Jena after three years, he tutored the children of Herr von Steiger, who was the Governor of [[Interlaken]]. During these three years, his tutoring job sparked his interest in educational reform. While tutoring in [[Switzerland]], Herbart met and came to know [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], the Swiss educator involved with issues of reform in the schools. Resigning from his tutoring position, Herbart went on to study [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Mathematics]] at [[University of Bremen|Bremen]] for three years, and then eventually moved on to attend [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] from 1801 to 1809. While there, he received a privat-docent for his endeavours in educational studies after receiving his doctoral degree. He gave his first philosophical lectures at [[Göttingen]] around 1805, whence he removed in 1809 to occupy the chair formerly held by Kant at [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]. Here he also established and conducted a seminary of pedagogy till 1833, when he returned once more to Göttingen, and remained there as professor of philosophy till his death. Herbart gave his last lecture in perfectly good health and then unexpectedly died two days later from apoplexy. He is buried in [[Albanifriedhof|Albanifriedhof Cemetery]] in Göttingen.

Herbart was very much focused on his studies, and “he barely saw the world outside his study and the classrooms” making “his world the world of books and only books”.{{sfn|Wolman|1968|p=29}} Regardless of his relentless studying, he met an eighteen-year-old English girl named Mary Drake one night when playing a game of charades. He became acquainted with her and asked her for her hand in marriage. They lived a happy life with Mary supporting all of her husband’s pursuits and contributions to the fields of pedagogy and psychology.

==Philosophy==

Philosophy, according to Herbart, begins with reflection upon our empirical conceptions, and consists in the reformation and elaboration of these, its three primary divisions being determined by as many distinct forms of elaboration. [[Philosophical logic|Logic]], which stands first, has to render our conceptions and the judgments and reasonings arising from them clear and distinct. But some conceptions are such that the more distinct they are made the more contradictory their elements become; so to change and supplement these as to make them at length thinkable is the problem of the second part of philosophy, or [[metaphysics]]. There is still a class of conceptions requiring more than a logical treatment, but differing from the last in not involving latent contradictions, and in being independent of the reality of their objects, the conceptions that embody our judgments of approval and disapproval; the philosophic treatment of these conceptions falls under [[aesthetics]].

===Logic===

In Herbart's writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice; he insisted strongly on its purely formal character and expressed himself in the main at one with Kantians such as [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]] and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug|Krug]].

===Metaphysics&lt;!--'Pluralistic realism' redirects here--&gt;===

As a metaphysician he starts from what he terms the higher [[scepticism]] of the [[David Hume|Hume]]an–[[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] sphere of thought, the beginnings of which he discerns in [[John Locke|Locke]]'s perplexity about the idea of [[Substance theory|substance]]. The validity of even the forms of experience is called in question on account of the contradictions they are found to involve. And yet that these forms are given to us, as truly as sensations are, follows beyond doubt when we consider that we are as little able to control the one as the other. To attempt at this stage a psychological inquiry into the origin of these conceptions would be doubly a mistake; for we should have to use these unlegitimated conceptions in the course of it, and the task of clearing up their contradictions would still remain, whether we succeeded in our enquiry or not.

But how are we to set about this task? We have given to us a conception A uniting among its constituent marks two that prove to be contradictory, say M and N; and we can neither deny the unity nor reject one of the contradictory members. For to do either is forbidden by experience; and yet to do nothing is forbidden by logic. We are thus driven to the assumption that the conception is contradictory because incomplete; but how are we to supplement it? What we have must point the way to what we want, or our procedure will be arbitrary. Experience asserts that M is the same (i.e. a mark of the same concept) as N, while logic denies it; and so it being impossible for one and the same M to sustain these contradictory positions there is but one way open to us; we must posit several Ms. But even now we cannot say one of these Ms is the same as N, another is not; for every M must be both thinkable and valid. We may, however, take the Ms not singly but together; and again, no other course being open to us, this is what we must do; we must assume that N results from a combination of Ms. This is Herbart's method of relations, the counterpart in his system of the [[Georg Hegel|Hegelian]] [[dialectic]].

In the ''[[Ontology]]'' this method is employed to determine what in reality corresponds to the empirical conceptions of substance and cause, or rather of inherence and change. But first we must analyse this notion of reality itself, to which our scepticism had already led us, for, though we could doubt whether the given is what it appears, we cannot doubt that it is something; the conception of the real thus consists of the two conceptions of being and quality. That which we are compelled to posit, which cannot be [[:wikt:sublation|sublated]], is that which is, and in the recognition of this lies the simple conception of being. But when is a thing thus posited? When it is posited as we usually posit the things we see and taste and handle. If we were without sensations, i.e. were never bound against our will to endure the persistence of a presentation, we should never know what being is.

Keeping fast hold of this idea of absolute position, Herbart leads us next to the quality of the real:
#This must exclude everything negative; for non-A sublates instead of positing, and is not absolute, but relative to A.
#The real must be absolutely simple; for if it contain two determinations, A and B, then either these are reducible to one, which is the true quality, or they are not, when each is conditioned by the other and their position is no longer absolute.
#All quantitative conceptions are excluded, for quantity implies parts, and these are incompatible with simplicity.
#But there may be a plurality of reals, albeit the mere conception of being can tell us nothing as to this.

The doctrine here developed is the first cardinal point of Herbart's system, and the name '''pluralistic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has been proposed for it by [[Otto Pfleiderer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Pfleiderer]], [https://books.google.gr/books?id=-rRZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''The Philosophy of Religion on the Basis of Its History, Volume 2''], Williams and Norgate, 1887, pp. 116, 215, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictions he finds in the common-sense conception of inherence, or of a thing with several attributes, will now become obvious. Take some thing, say A, having ''n'' attributes, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ...: we are forced to posit each of these because each is presented in intuition. But in conceiving A we make, not ''n'' positions, still less ''n''+1 positions, but one position simply; for common sense removes the absolute position from its original source, sensation. So when we ask, What is the one posited? we are told the possessor of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' or in other words, their seat or substance. But if so, then A, as a real, being simple, must be equal to ''a''; similarly it must be ''b''; and so on.

Now this would be possible if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ... were only [[contingent]] aspects of A, as for example 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, {{radic|64}}, 4+3+1 are contingent aspects of 8. Such, of course, is not the case, and so we have as many contradictions as there are attributes; for we must say A is ''a'', is not ''a'', is ''b'', is not ''b'', etc. There must then, according to the method of relations, be several As. For ''a'' let us assume A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ...&amp;nbsp;; for ''b'', A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ...; and so on for the rest.But now what relation can there be among these several As, which will restore to us the unity of our original A or substance? There is just one; we must assume that the first A of every series is identical, just as the centre is the same point in every radius.

By way of concrete illustration Herbart instances “the common observation that the properties of things exist only under external conditions. Bodies, we say, are coloured, but color is nothing without light, and nothing without eyes. They sound, but only in a vibrating medium, and for healthy ears. Colour and tone present the appearance of inherence, but on looking closer we find they are not really immanent in things but rather presuppose a communion among several.” The result then is briefly thus: In place of the one absolute position, which in some unthinkable way the common understanding substitutes for the absolute positions of the ''n'' attributes, we have really a series of two or more positions for each attribute, every series, however, beginning with the same (as it were, central) real (hence the unity of substance in a group of attributes), but each being continued by different reals (hence the plurality and difference of attributes in unity of substance). Where there is the appearance of inherence, therefore, there is always a plurality of reals; no such correlative to substance as attribute or accident can be admitted at all. Substantiality is impossible without causality, and to this as its true correlative we now turn.

The common-sense conception of change involves at bottom the same contradiction of opposing qualities in one real. The same A that was ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ... becomes ''a'', ''b'', ''d'' ...; and this, which experience thrusts upon us, proves on reflection unthinkable. The metaphysical supplementing is also fundamentally as before. Since ''c'' depended on a series of reals A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ... in connection with A, and ''d'' may be said similarly to depend on a series A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ..., then the change from ''c'' to ''d'' means, not that the central real A or any real has changed, but that A is now in connection with A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, etc., and no longer in connection with A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.

But to think a number of reals in connection (''Zusammensein'') will not suffice as an explanation of phenomena; something or other must happen when they are in connection; what is it? The answer to this question is the second hinge-point of Herbart's theoretical philosophy.

What actually happens as distinct from all that seems to happen, when two reals A and B are together is that, assuming them to differ in quality, they tend to disturb each other to the extent of that difference, at the same time that each preserves itself intact by resisting, as it were, the others disturbance. And so by coining into connection with different reals the self-preservations of A will vary accordingly, A remaining the same through all; just as, by way of illustration, hydrogen remains the same in water and in ammonia, or as the same line may be now a normal and now a tangent. But to indicate this opposition in the qualities of the reals A+B, we must substitute for these symbols others, which, though only contingent aspects of A and B, i.e. representing their relations, not themselves, yet like similar devices in mathematics enable thought to advance. Thus we may put A = ''&amp;alpha;''+''&amp;beta;''-''&amp;gamma;'', B = ''m''+''n''+''&amp;gamma;''; ''&amp;gamma;'' then represents the character of the
self-preservations in this case, and ''&amp;alpha;''+''&amp;beta;''+''m''+''n'' represents all that could be observed by a spectator who did not know the simple qualities, but was himself involved in the relations of A to B; and such is exactly our position.

Having thus determined what really is and what actually happens, our philosopher proceeds next to explain synthetically the objective semblance (''der objective Schein'') that results from these. But if this construction is to be truly objective, i.e. valid for all intelligences, ontology must furnish us with a clue. This we have in the forms of Space, Time and Motion which are involved whenever we think the reals as being in, or coming into, connection and the opposite. These forms then cannot be merely the products of our psychological mechanism, though they may turn out to coincide with these. Meanwhile, let us call them intelligible, as being valid for all who comprehend the real and actual by thought, although no such forms are predicable of the real and actual themselves.

The elementary spatial relation Herbart conceives to be “the contiguity (''Aneinander'') of two points,” so that every “pure and independent line” is discrete. But an investigation of dependent lines which are often incommensurable forces us to adopt the contradictory fiction of partially overlapping, i.e. divisible points, or in other words, the conception of Continuity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
Hence Herbart gave the name ''synechology'' to this branch of metaphysics, instead of the usual one, [[cosmology]].
&lt;/ref&gt; But the contradiction here is one we cannot eliminate by the method of relations, because it does not involve anything real; and in fact as a necessary outcome of an intelligible form, the fiction of continuity is valid for the objective semblance. By its help we are enabled to comprehend what actually happens among reals to produce the appearance of water. When three or more reals are together, each disturbance and self-preservation will (in general) be imperfect, i.e. of less intensity than when only two reals are together. But objective semblance corresponds with reality; the spatial or external relations of the reals in this case must, therefore, tally with their inner or actual states. Had the self-preservations been perfect, the coincidence in space would have been complete, and the group of reals would have been inextended; or had the several reals been simply contiguous, i.e. without connection, then, as nothing would actually have happened, nothing would appear. As it is we shall find a continuous molecule manifesting attractive and repulsive forces; attraction corresponding to the tendency of the self-preservations to become perfect, repulsion to the frustration of this. Motion, even more evidently than space, implicates the contradictory conception of continuity and cannot, therefore, be a real predicate, though valid as an intelligible form and necessary to the comprehension of the objective semblance. For we have to think of the reals as absolutely independent and yet as entering into connections. This we can only do by conceiving them as originally moving through intelligible space in rectilinear paths and with uniform velocities. For such motion no cause need be supposed; motion, in fact, is no more a state of the moving real than rest is, both alike being but relations, with which, therefore, the real has no concern. The changes in this motion, however, for which we should require a cause, would be the objective semblance of the self-preservations that actually occur when reals meet. Further, by means of such motion these actual occurrences, which are in themselves timeless, fall for an observer in a definite time — a time which becomes continuous through the partial coincidence of events.

But in all this it has been assumed that we are spectators of the objective semblance; it remains to make good this assumption, or, in other words, to show the possibility of knowledge; this is the problem of what Herbart terms Eidolology, and forms the transition from metaphysic to psychology. Here, again, a contradictory conception blocks the way, that, viz. of the Ego as the identity of knowing and being, and as such the stronghold of idealism. The contradiction becomes more evident when the ego is denned to be a subject (and so a real) that is its own object. As real and not merely formal, this conception of the ego is amenable to the method of relations. The solution this method furnishes is summarily that there are several objects which mutually modify each other, and so constitute that ego we take for the presented real. But to explain this modification is the business of psychology; it is enough now to see that the subject like all reals is necessarily unknown and that, therefore, the idealist's theory of knowledge is unsound. But though the simple quality of the subject or soul is beyond knowledge, we know what actually happens when it is in connection with other's reals, for its self-preservations then are what we call sensations. And these sensations are the sole material of our knowledge; but they are not given to us as a chaos but in definite groups and series, whence we come to know the relations of those reals, which, though themselves unknown, our sensations compel us to posit absolutely.

===Principles of education ===

Herbart's pedagogy emphasised the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. In Platonic tradition, Herbart espoused that only by becoming productive citizens could people fulfill their true purpose: “He believed that every child is born with a unique potential, his Individuality, but that this potential remained unfulfilled until it was analysed and transformed by education in accordance with what he regarded as the accumulated values of civilisation”.{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=70}}  Only formalised, rigorous education could, he believed, provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice and Equity or Recompense.{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=72}}

According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. In order to develop an educational paradigm that would provide an intellectual base that would lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilise a methodology with five formal steps: “Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of 
interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back and deductively summed up the lesson's achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living”.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=114}}

In order to appeal to learners' interests, Herbart advocated using literature and historical stories instead of the drier basal readers that were popular at the time. Whereas the moralistic tales in many of the primers and readers of the period were predictable and allegorical, Herbart felt that children would appreciate the psychological and literary nuances of the masterpieces of the canon.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=111}}

Though he died in 1841, his pedagogy enjoyed a renaissance of sorts in the mid-19th century; while Germany was its intellectual centre, it "found a ready echo in those countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in which the development of Individuality into Character appeared particularly well attuned to the prevailing economic, political and social circumstances."{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=77}} Among those who espoused and advocated his ideas in the United Kingdom was [[Catherine Isabella Dodd]].&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Dodd (1904).&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of individual potentiality and civic responsibility seemed to reflect democratic ideals.

Though the emphasis on character building through literary appreciation diminished somewhat after the movement toward utilitarianism following the [[First World War]], Herbart's pedagogy continues to influence the field by raising important questions about the role of critical thinking, and literary appreciation in education.

===Aesthetics and ethics===

Aesthetics elaborates the ideas involved in the expression called forth by those relations of object which acquire for them attribution of beauty or the reverse. The beautiful is to be carefully distinguished from the allied conceptions of the useful or the pleasant, which vary with time, place and person; whereas beauty is predicated absolutely and involuntarily by all who have attained the right standpoint. Ethics, which is but one branch of aesthetics, although the chief, deals with such relations among volitions (''Willensverhältnisse'') as thus unconditionally please or displease. These relations Herbart finds to be reducible to five, which do admit of further simplification; and corresponding to them are as many moral ideas (''Musterbegriffe''), as follows:
#Internal Freedom, the underlying relation being that of the individual's will to his judgment of it
#Perfection, the relation being that of his several volitions each other in respect of intensity, variety and concentration
#Benevolence, the relation being that between his own will and the thought of another's
#Right, in case of actual conflict with other
#Retribution or Equity, for intended good or evil
The ideas of a final society, a system of rewards and punishments, a system of administration, a system of culture and an animated society, corresponding to the ideas of law, equity, benevolence, perfection and internal freedom respectively, result when we take account of a number of individuals. Virtue is the perfect conformity of the will with the moral ideas; of this the single virtues are but special expressions. The conception of duty arises from the existence of hindrances to the attainment of virtue. A general scheme of principles of conduct is possible, but the sublimation of special cases under these must remain matter of fact. The application of ethics to things as they are with a view to the realisation of the moral ideas is moral technology (''Tugendlehre''), which the chief divisions are Paedagogy and Politics.

===Theology===

In [[theology]] Herbart held the [[argument from design]] to be as valid of divine activity as for human, and to justify the belief in a supersensible real, concerning which, however, exact knowledge is neither tenable nor on practical grounds desirable.

==Psychology==

===Herbart's concept of the ''Real''===

Building upon the teaching methods of Pestalozzi, Herbart contributed to pedagogy a psychological basis to help facilitate better learning as well as to ensure children’s character development. He was the first individual to point out how important a role psychology plays on education. In developing his ideas about psychology, Herbart came to disagree with Kant about how true knowledge is obtained. Kant believed that we become knowledgeable through studying the innate categories of thought, while Herbart believed that one learns only from studying external and real objects in the world as well as the ideas that come about from observing them. Examining the difference between the actual existence of an object and its appearance, Herbart concluded that “the world is a world of things-in-themselves [and] the things-in-themselves are perceivable.”{{sfn|Wolman|1968|p=33}} Everything’s appearance indicates that it exists. He considered all external objects existing in the world as ''reals'', which can be compared to [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] concept of [[Monadology|monads]].
 								
Subscribing to [[John Locke|Locke's]] empiricist viewpoint involving the ''[[tabula rasa]]'', Herbart believed that the soul had no innate ideas or no already pre-established Kantian categories of thought. The soul, considered to be a ''real'', was thought to be completely passive initially as well as very resistant to changes outside factors exert and force upon it. Even though ''reals'' are disrupted by other forces appearing to cause a change in the ''reals'' themselves, they are thought to be unchangeable. ''Reals'' tend to collide and struggle with one another so much so that each ''real'' fights for its own self-preservation (Selbsterhaltung). The way in which the soul helps to preserve itself from its outwardly perceived destruction is through Herbart’s concept of Vorstellungen, or ideas or mental representations. These ideas were regarded as dynamic forces that Herbart attempted to explain by means of mathematical formulas. [[Isaac Newton|Newton’s]] influence can be seen in Herbart’s beliefs about how forces mechanically interact with one another in the world to affect perceptions of reality. The mechanics of ideas involved their ability to move in different ways, whether they be moving up into the conscious or delving down into the unconscious. Different ideas come into contact with each other and result in more complex ideas through the processes of blending, fusing, fading and combining in a multitude of approaches. It is evident Herbart thought that ideas were not precise imitations of the existing items in the world but that they were the direct consequence of the interactions of individuals’ experiences with the external environment. An individual can only gain all the facts and their associated truth by understanding how their mental representations combine and potentially inhibit or contribute to one another.

===Apperception===

Herbart believed ideas crossed a [[limen]] of consciousness, or a boundary between the [[consciousness|conscious]] and the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], as they became clearer and strong enough to preserve themselves against their struggle with other forces. The ideas powerful enough to break through to the conscious formed the apperceiving mass, or a congregation of similar and related ideas dominating the conscious at any given moment. Expounding upon [[Leibniz]]’s concept of pétites perceptions and the idea of [[apperception]], Herbart believed the apperceiving mass to be crucial in selecting similar ideas from down in the unconscious to join its forces in the conscious. Although the individual is focusing all of his/her attention on those complex ideas a part of the apperceiving mass in the conscious, it is possible for ideas in the unconscious to combine with other ideas related to them and struggle to break through the limen into the conscious, disrupting the present ideas a part of the apperceiving mass. Apperception played a key role in Herbart’s educational theory. He saw apperception as more pivotal in the classroom than sense-perception because focusing on a child’s apperceiving mass in relation to the material being taught can inform teachers of how to implement the material in such a way as to direct the child’s ideas and thoughts to attend to certain information.

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Knight, Death and Devil (NGA 1943.3.3519).jpg|thumb|320px|''Knight, Death and the Devil'', 1513, [[engraving]], 24.5 x 19.1 cm]]

'''''Knight, Death and the Devil''''' ({{lang-de|Ritter, Tod und Teufel}}) is a large 1513 [[engraving]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]], one of the three ''Meisterstiche'' (master prints)&lt;ref&gt;Along with ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'' and ''[[Melencolia I]]'', both 1514&lt;/ref&gt; completed during a period when he almost ceased to work in paint or woodcuts to focus on engravings. The image is infused with complex iconography and symbolism, the precise meaning of which has been argued over for centuries.

An armoured knight, accompanied by his dog, rides through a narrow gorge flanked by a goat-headed devil and the [[Death (personification)|figure of death]] riding a [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse#Pale Horse|pale horse]]. Death's rotting corpse holds an [[hourglass]], a reminder of the shortness of life. The rider moves through the scene looking away from the creatures lurking around him, and appears almost contemptuous of the threats, and is thus often seen as symbol of courage;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 15&lt;/ref&gt; the knight's armor, the horse which towers in size over the beasts, the oak leaves and the fortress on the mountaintop are symbolic of the resilience of faith, while the knight's plight may represent Christians' earthly journey towards the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://museum.cornell.edu/exhibitions/albrecht-d%C3%BCrer-master-prints Albrecht Dürer: The Master Prints]". Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University. Retrieved 20 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was mentioned by [[Giorgio Vasari]] as one of "several sheets of such excellence that nothing finer can be achieved".&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J. "The Renaissance in the North". New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1987. 99&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely copied and had a large influence on later German writers. Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referenced the work in his work on dramatic theory ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) to exemplify pessimism, while it was later idealised in the 20th century by the [[Nazis]] as representing the racially pure [[Aryan]], and was sometimes used in their propaganda imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Ashley.

==Composition==
[[File:Detalhe gravura Dürer 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Detail]]

As with the two other of his ''Meisterstiche'', it contains a skull, dog, and hourglass, while all three are identical in size. The engraving is heavily indebted to the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style. Many of the forms blend into each other. The outline of the horse is built from a series of interlocking curves, while the knight's chin is woven into the line of his helmet. These two central figures are surrounded by a tangled mass of branches, harness and hair, which according to art historian Raymond Stites contrast with the relatively solid figure of the knight and his horse to set them as a "tangible idea in a world of changing forms".&lt;ref name="S465"&gt;Stites, 465&lt;/ref&gt; The man is shown looking doggedly straight ahead, he does not allow his line of vision be interrupted or distracted by the demons beside him.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Daniel. "Epilogue". ''Journal of Psychoanalytic Inquiry'', Volume 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elizabeth Lunday the "skeletal figure of death stands ghostly pale against the darkness of a shadowy crag, while the devil, a multihorned  goatlike creature, skulks amongst straggly tree roots."&lt;ref&gt;Lunday, Elizabeth. "Secret Lives of Great Artists". Quirk Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Death is shown with his horse in the left background and rendered without nose or lips in lighter shades than the other figures.&lt;ref name="S465" /&gt; A skull is seen in the lower foreground, directly in the Knight's path, whilst a dog is running between the two horses.

Death, the Devil, and the landscape are all rendered in a bleakly [[Northern Renaissance|northern]] manner. The surrounding characters are threatening to the knight, who is seemingly protected by the literal and figurative [[Armor of God|armor of his faith]]. It is believed by some art historians to be linked with publications of the Dutch humanist and theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]'' (''Handbook of a Christian soldier'').&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/43.106.2 Knight, Death, and the Devil, 1513–14]". [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]. Retrieved June 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving draws from [[Psalm 23]]; "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil".&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer,_knight,_death.aspx |title=Albrecht Dürer, Knight, Death and the Devil, a copperplate engraving |publisher=[[British Museum]] |access-date=June 12, 2010 |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108062023/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer%2C_knight%2C_death.aspx |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' is dated and signed by the artist; the bottom left of the tablet is scribed "S. (=Salus/in the year of grace) 1513."&lt;ref name="Dublin"/&gt; In contrast, American artist [[Ursula Meyer]] believed that the knight displayed in this print is not a Christian knight at all, but a "robber knight" (''raubritter''). She believes that the iconography of the fox tail symbolises the greed of the knight, and that Death and the Devil are merely the knight's companions on his journey, not omens.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 27–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Duerer - Ritter zu Pferde.jpg|180px|thumb|''Knight on horse'', a study from c.1512–13.]]
[[File:Duerer - Studie Reiter 1495.jpg|180px|thumb|Albrecht Dürer, ''Study of a rider'', 1498]]
The work was created while Dürer was in the service of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] but was not a commission and does not contain an overtly political message. Instead it reaches back to a medieval sense of morality, and is replete with Gothic imagery.&lt;ref name="S465"&gt;Stites, 465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getlein &amp; Getlein, 68&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving bears similarities in mood and tone to one of Dürer's other great prints ''[[Melencolia I]]''. The knight seems resigned, and his facial features are downcast. His gloomy posture is in contrast to the sturdy look of his horse. While his armor may protect him against the surrounding demons, the skull on a stump is held in front of the horse and the fall of the sand held by death in the face of the knight. According to writer Dorothy Getlein, "there is a sense of obsolescence about the knight accompanied by Death and the Devil."&lt;ref&gt;Getlein &amp; Getlein, 72&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Holland Cotter]] noted that the composition followed soon after Dürer's beloved mother died a painful death.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter, "The Renaissance Followed Him North", ''The New York Times'', March 22, 2013, [https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9C06E5DE163AF931A15750C0A9659D8B63.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian 19th-century art historian [[Moritz Thausing]] suggested that Dürer had created ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' as part of a four-work cycle, each designed to illustrate one of the [[four temperaments]]. According to Thausing, the work was intended to represent [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguinity]], hence the "S" engraved in the work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo4sAAAAMAAJ Masters in art: a series of illustrated monographs, Volume 5]. Bates and Guild Co., 1904. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally believed that the portrayal is a literal, though pointed, celebration of the knight's Christian faith, and also of the ideals of [[humanism]]. An alternative interpretation was presented in 1970 by writer Sten Karling, who suggested that the work did not seek to glorify the knight, but instead depict a "robber Baron". Karling points to the lack of Christian or religious symbolism in the work and to the fox's tail wrapped on top the knight's lance – in Greek legend&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Physiologus]] text; see Nürnberg, 74&lt;/ref&gt; the fox's tail was a symbol of greed, cunning and treachery, as well as [[lust]] and [[whoring]].&lt;ref name="Dublin"&gt;Nürnberg, 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, knights were commonly depicted in contemporary art with a fox tail tied to the tip of their lance. Moreover, the fox tail was a common form of protective [[amulet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lLBlor8nIu0C&amp;pg=PA10 The Landsknechts], Douglas Miller, 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is considered one among three of Dürer's "Meisterstiche" (''master prints''); along with [[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514).&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; In particular, the horse is skillfully rendered in geometric shapes that call to mind [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and reflect the [[Renaissance]] interest in natural sciences and anatomy.&lt;ref name="Dublin" /&gt;

In 1870 [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] gave a print of the engraving to [[Richard Wagner]]. The work was significant to Nietzsche as a representation of a "brave future" and as such he gave a copy to his [[Elisabeth Nietzsche|sister]] on the eve of her emigration to [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, 39&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]], writers [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Ernst Bertram]] described the work as close to what Nietzsche could teach about the fate of Germany; the embodiment of the [[Renaissance]] and the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and as described by Gary Shapiro, they believed it was "invoked in order to intensify the sense of resolute determination in the absence of all hope."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Although Durer did not meet Luther, his writings indicate that he admired him highly, and the engraving may well have been intended as a tribute to him.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Snyder, James (ed). "[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Vol_5_The_Renaissance_in_the_North The Renaissance in the North]". Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1987. p. 14. Retrieved 22 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0168, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|120px|Nazi theorist and ideologue Alfred Rosenberg]]
Dürer was idealised from the 1920s by ideologues within the [[Nazi]] party as "the most German of German artists". At a 1927 Nazi rally the philosopher, Nazi theorist and ideologue, and later convicted war criminal [[Alfred Rosenberg]] compared the assembled [[stormtrooper]]s to the warrior in ''Knight, Death and the Devil'', exclaiming that "in everything that you do, remember that for the National Socialists only one thing counts: to cry out to the world: And even if the world is full of devils, we must win anyway!"&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, Stephen. ''Nuremberg: The Imaginary Capital''. London: Camden House, 2006. 144. {{ISBN|978-1-5711-3345-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the mayor of [[Nuremberg]] presented [[Hitler]] with an original print of ''Knight, Death and the Devil'',&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; and described Hitler as the "knight without fear or blame, who as the [[Führer]] of the new German [[Reich]], once again carried and multiplied the fame of the old imperial city of Nuremberg to the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other writers===
Argentine writer and poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote two poems based on the engraving, titled "Ritter, Tod, und Teufel" (I) and "Ritter, Tod und Teufel" (II). In the first he praises the knight's [[courage]], writing, "Being / brave, [[Teuton]], you surely will be / worthy of the Devil and Death."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, 98&lt;/ref&gt; In the second he compares his own state to the knight, writing, "It's me and not the Knight that the old, white-faced man, head crowned with writhing snakes, exhorts."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[print room]]s with a significant collection will have a copy, and there are many, often late and worn, impressions in private collections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42956">An [[architectural style]] is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable.  A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character.  Most [[architecture]] can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different.

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.

==Examples of styles==
&lt;!--- Please don't flood this gallery! We should end up with a maximum of 8, perhaps 10, examples of DIFFERENT styles here. ---&gt;

==Chronology of styles==
{{Expand list|date=March 2011}}

===Prehistoric===
Early [[civilizations]] developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.

===The Dark Ages===
The European "Dark Ages" are generally taken to run from the end of the [[Roman Empire]], around 400 AD, to around 1000 AD. Relatively little is known of this period, but Christianity (spread by the Romans) was already making a significant impact on European culture, and the Romans left a technological and social legacy.

===Medieval Europe===
The dominance of the Church over everyday life was expressed in grand spiritual designs which emphasized piety and sobriety. The Romanesque style was simple and austere. The Gothic style heightened the effect with heavenly spires, pointed arches and religious carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zyHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA75 Robert Stuart (1854), ''Cyclopedia of architecture: historical, descriptive, typographical, decorative, theoretical and mechanical, alphabetically arranged, familiarly explained, and adapted to the comprehension of workmen'', A.

===The Renaissance and its successors===

1425-1660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Leinwand, ''The pageant of world history'', Prentice-Hall, 1990, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7jzT0qcJu1MC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Jackson J.

===Neoclassicism===
1720-1837 and onward. A time often depicted as a rural idyll by the great painters, but in fact was a hive of early industrial activity, with small kilns and workshops springing up wherever materials could be mined or manufactured. After the Renaissance, neoclassical forms were developed and refined into new styles for public buildings and the gentry.

===Revivalism and Orientalism===
Late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Victorian Era was a time of giant leaps forward in technology and society, such as iron bridges, aqueducts, sewer systems, roads, canals, trains, and factories. As engineers, inventors, and businessmen they reshaped much of the British Empire, including the UK, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and influenced Europe and the United States. Architecturally, they were revivalists who modified old styles to suit new purposes.

===Modernism and other styles contemporary with modernism===
1880 onwards. The Industrial Revolution had brought steel, plate glass, and mass-produced components. These enabled a brave new world of bold structural frames, with clean lines and plain or shiny surfaces. In the early stages, a popular motto was "[[Ornament and Crime|decoration is a crime]]". In the [[Eastern Bloc]] the Communists rejected the [[Western Bloc]]'s 'decadent' ways, and modernism developed in a markedly more bureaucratic, sombre, and monumental fashion.

'''Roofing material''' is the outermost layer on the [[roof]] of a building, sometimes self-supporting, but generally supported by an underlying structure. A building's roofing material provides shelter from the natural elements. The outer layer of a roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material, and the nature of the supporting structure. Those types of roofing material which are commercially available range from natural products such as [[thatch]] and [[slate]] to commercially produced products such as [[tiles]] and [[polycarbonate]] sheeting. Roofing materials may be placed on top of a secondary water-resistant material called underlayment.

==Materials==
The weatherproofing material is the topmost or outermost layer exposed to the weather.  Many materials have been used as weatherproofing material:
* [[Thatch]] is roofing made of plant stalks in overlapping layers
** [[Wheat]] [[straw]], widely used in England, France, and other parts of Europe
**[[Seagrass]], used in coastal areas where there are [[estuary|estuaries]] such as Scotland. Has a longer life than straw. Claimed to have a life in excess of 60 years.
** [[Rye]] straw, commonly used in a barn.
** Raffia palm leaves:A well organised raffia palm leaves is mainly used as roof houses in Nigeria, especially among the Igbos.
** [[Rice]] straw, commonly used in Eastern Asia.
** Water reed, commonly used in Ireland for [[Thatching]].
* [[Roof shingle|Shingle]] is the generic term for a roofing material that is in many overlapping sections, 
** [[Wood shingle]], shingles sawn from bolts of wood such as [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] which has a useful performance life expectancy of up to 30 years. However, young growth red cedar has a short life expectancy and high cost. In the United States and Canada, eastern [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] is also used. Some [[hardwood]]s were very durable roofing found in Colonial [[Australian architecture|Australian]] and [[American colonial architecture]]; their use is now usually limited to [[building restoration]]. All wood shingles benefit by being allowed to breathe (dry out from below).
** [[Shake (shingle)]], Are different than wood shingles in that they are split on one side and sawed on the back side. Commonly referred to as "resawn Shakes". A cedar shake is NOT the same as a cedar shingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grading and Manufacturing {{!}} Products {{!}} Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau|url = http://www.cedarbureau.org/frequently-asked-questions/product/grading-and-manufacturing.asp|website = www.cedarbureau.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Slate]]. High cost with a life expectancy of 80 to 400 years. See the article [[slate industry]] for an overview including names of quarries. Some of the famous quarries where the highest quality slate comes from that are available in Australia are Bethesda in Wales and areas of Spain.
** [[Asphalt shingle]] made of bitumen embedded in an organic or fiberglass mat, usually covered with colored, man-made ceramic grit. Cheaper than slate or tiles. The reduced cost of this particular style of roofing is especially apparent in its application and removal. Installation is very streamlined and a rapid process. Depending on the size of the roof and the experience of the crew, it is possible to remove old shingles and apply new ones on 2-3 houses in one day. Life span varies. Use only on slanted roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing Requirements One- and Two- Family Dwellings|url=http://roofingroger.com/roofing-requirements-one-and-two-family-dwellings/|publisher=Regulatory Services Department|accessdate=29 August 2015|quote=Asphalt-based organic and fiberglass shingles may only be used on roofs with slopes of 2:12 and greater.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Rubber shingle, alternative to asphalt shingle, slate, shake or tile. Made primarily of rubber, often recycled tire-derived rubber. Other typical ingredients include binders, UV (ultraviolet light) inhibitors and color. Warranted and designed to last at least 50 years in most cases.
** [[Asbestos]] shingles. Very long lifespan, fireproof, and low cost but now rarely used because of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asbestos_and_your_health?open | title=Asbestos and your health | publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]] | work=Better Health Channel | date=September 2011 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Stone slab. Heavy stone slabs (not to be confused with slate) 1–2 inches thick were formerly used as roofing tiles in some regions in England, the [[Alps]], and [[Scandinavia]]. Stone slabs require a very heavyweight roof structure, but their weight makes them stormproof. An obsolete roofing material, now used commercially only for building restoration.
*** [[Collyweston stone slate]]
** [[Solar shingle]]
** Metal shakes or shingles. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of 3:12 pitch or greater. Because of the flexibility of metal, they can be manufactured to lock together, giving durability and reducing assembly time. For a discussion of copper system shingles, see [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding]].
* Ceramic [[tile#Roof tiles|tile]]. High cost, life of more than 100 years.
** [[Imbrex and tegula]], style dating back to ancient Greece and Rome.
** [[Monk and Nun]], a style similar to Imbrex and tegula, but basically using two Imbrex tiles.
** [[Dutch roof tiles]], Netherlands
** [[Mangalore tiles]], India
* [[Membrane roofing]]. Membrane roofing is in large sheets, generally fused in some way at the joints to form a continuous surface.
** [[Thermoset membrane]] (e.g. [[EPDM rubber]]). [[Synthetic rubber]] sheets adhered together with contact adhesive or tape. Primary application is big box stores with large open areas.
** [[Thermoplastic]]s (e.g. [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[ThermoPlastic Olefin|TPO]], [[Hypalon|CSPE]]) – Plastic sheets welded together with hot air, creating one continuous sheet membrane. They can be re-welded with the exception of CSPE. Lends itself well to both big box and small roof application because of its hot air weldability. This membrane is installed by two methods: 1.) Rolls of membrane are attached to the ridged insulation using a bonding adhesive; 2.) The edge of each roll is fastened through ridged insulation into structural deck, and the proceeding roll is lapped over the fasteners.  The overlap is then heat-welded with hot air to create a mechanically fastened thermoplastic roof. PVC is also known as IB.[[Vinyl roof membrane]].
** [[Liquid roofing]]
** [[Asphalt roll roofing]] including single and double coverage types.
** [[Bituminous waterproofing]] is a general term for:
*** Modified [[bitumen]] – heat-welded, asphalt-adhered, or installed with adhesive. Asphalt is mixed with polymers such as APP or SBS, then applied to fiberglass and/or polyester mat, seams sealed by locally melting the asphalt with heat, hot mopping of asphalt, or adhesive.  Lends itself well to most applications.
*** Built-up roof – Multiple plies of salt-saturated organic felt or coated fiberglass felts. Plies of felt are adhered with hot asphalt, coal tar pitch, or adhesive.  Although the roof membrane can be left bare, it is typically covered with a thick coat of the waterproofing material and covered with gravel.  The gravel provides protection from ultra-violet degradation, stabilizes the temperature changes, protects surface of the roof, and increases the weight of the roof system to resist wind blow-off.
**[[Textile|Fabric]]
** [[polyester]].
** [[PTFE]], (synthetic fluoropolymer) embedded in [[fibreglass]].
* [[Metal roof]]ing.
** [[Corrugated galvanised iron]] is [[Hot-dip galvanizing|Galvanised steel]] manufactured with wavy corrugations to resist lateral flexing and fitted with exposed fasteners. Widely used for low cost and durability. Sheds are normally roofed with this material. ''Gal iron'' or ''Corro'' was the most extensively used roofing material of 20th century Australia, now replaced in popularity by steel with longer-lasting, coloured, alloy coatings.
** [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|Copper roofs]] can last for hundreds of years. Copper roofing offers durability, ease of fabrication, lighter weight than some other roofing materials, can be curved, low maintenance, corrosion resistance, low thermal movement, lightning protection, radio frequency shielding, and are 100% recyclable. Copper roofs have a high initial cost but very long lifetime: tests on European copper roofs from the 18th Century showed that, in theory, copper roofs can last one thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;The glory of copper; ''Metal Roofing Magazine,'' December 2002/January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of copper roofing systems is that they are relatively easy to repair.
** Standing-seam metal with concealed fasteners.
** Mechanically seamed metal with concealed fasteners contains sealant in seams for use on very low sloped roofs, suitable for roofs of low pitch such as 0.5/12 to 3/12 pitch.
** Flat-seam metal with or without soldered seams.
** [[Steel]] coated with a coloured [[alloy]] of [[zinc]] and [[aluminium]].
** [[Stone-coated metal roofing]].
* [[Concrete]] or [[fibre cement]], usually reinforced with fibres of some sort.
** may also be in the form of concrete tiles.
* Structural concrete can also be used for flat roof constructions. There are three main categories, [[Prestressed concrete|precast/prestressed]], cast-in-place and [[Concrete shell|shell]]. There are many types of precast/prestressed concrete roofing. The following are the most common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concrete Roof Systems Part 1: Precast/Prestressed Constructions |url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171509/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Double tee]]s are the most common products for short spans up to {{Convert|60|ft}}
** [[Hollow-core slab]]s are used when there is a need for flushed ceiling.
** [[T-beam]]s are similar to double tees but can be used for span ranging from {{Convert|30|ft}} to {{Convert|100|ft}}.
** [[Joist]]s and [[Concrete slab|planks]] are combination of using prestressed joists with prestressed planks. [[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]]-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|36|ft|adj=on}} spans and tee-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|60|ft|adj=on}} span.

==Other components==

The Little Carib Theatre was formally opened in November 1948.

By the 1960s, the work of the Little Carib Dance Company had been recognised and celebrated overseas, having performed at such events as the Caribbean Festival of Arts in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952, the [[Jamaica]] Tercentenary Celebrations in 1955 and the opening of the Federal Parliament of [[Toronto]] in April 1958. In the 1960s the Little Carib building had to be closed down and was re-built in three years.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

'''The Los Angeles Poverty Department''' (LAPD) is a [[Los Angeles]]-based performance group closely tied to the city's [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]] neighborhood. Founded in 1985 by director and activist John Malpede, LAPD members are mostly homeless or formerly homeless people who collaborate with advocates, social service professionals and community members to create performances and multimedia art that highlight connections between their lived experiences and external forces that impact their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you want the cosmetic version or do you want the real deal?

==History==

Performance artist John Malpede moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1984 to start work as an outreach paralegal at the [http://www.innercitylaw.org/ Inner City Law Center] (ICLC). He began leading theater workshops for the neighborhood's homeless population out of the ICLC's offices on Skid Row, gathering a group of performers and artists who now create their art as the Los Angeles Poverty Department (the acronym, LAPD, is a deliberate appropriation of that of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Colby|title=Los Angeles Poverty Department|journal=Artforum International|date=April 2014|volume=52|issue=8|page=263|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1514895730?accountid=14512|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was founded, the LAPD was the first theater by and for homeless people in the country and the first arts-based initiative for the Los Angeles homeless population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Maria Rosario|last2=Malpede|first2=John|title=Making the Case for Skid Row Culture: Findings from a Collaborative Inquiry by the Los Angeles Poverty Department and the Urban Institute|journal=Arts &amp; Civic Engagement Impact Initiative of Animating Democracy (Americans for the Arts)|date=2009|url=http://www.lapovertydept.org/home/newsletters/making-the-case-for-skid-row-culture/download.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the LAPD has been dedicated to giving expression to the homeless community's struggle to  create meaning out of their own lives and to avoid a sentimentalized or stereotyped narrative of victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graver|first1=David|last2=Kruger|first2=Lauren|title=Dispossessing the Spectator: Performance, Environment, and Subjectivity in Theatre of the Homeless|journal=Tdr (1988-)|date=Summer 1991|volume=35|issue=2|id=page 172|pages=157–175|jstor=1146094}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Material is often developed and rehearsed through community workshops and feedback sessions, continually evolving through conversation with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

The '''MGR film city''' is an integrated [[film studio]] complex in  [[Taramani]], [[Chennai]]. It was established in 1994 mainly to attract filmmakers and tourists and originally named after former chief minister of tamilnadu MG Ramachandran  JJ Film City by the AIADMK government. When DMK returned to power in 1996 it was renamed MGR Film City after the popular actor and late [[Chief Minister]] [[M. G. Ramachandran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiamarks.com/indian-film-cities/|title=Indian Film Cities|publisher=indiamarks|accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also houses a film institute, known as [[Adyar Film Institute|MGR Film and Television Institute]].

==Features==
The MGR Film City has numerous sets built on various themes to serve as scenery for movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/movie-park-planned-in-city/336878/|title=Movie park planned in city|publisher=business-standard|accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sets on [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Japan]]ese themes are popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=S.

[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] visited the place during her tour to India in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/revents/01/19970110.htm |title=National events in October 1997 |publisher=thehindu |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231084148/http://www.hindu.com/revents/01/19970110.htm |archivedate=2003-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= T.S.Subramaniyan|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1422/14220430.htm|title= A rough passage to India |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it experienced initial success the film city fell back accumulating a loss of 14{{nbsp}} [[crores]] (140 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/bline/2002/08/03/stories/2002080301931700.htm|title= MGR film city to give way to knowledge park|publisher=thehindubusinessline|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2002-08-02|accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has entertainment facilities for children. [[Bollywood]] actor [[Aamir Khan]] donated rupees 1.5 [[lakh]]s (({{INR}})150,000 or $3,000 to $4,000) to the city in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asitlive.com/children-of-bigger-god-talk-by-anupam-kher-on-the-occasion-of-11th-gollapudi-srinivas-national-award-to-aamir-khan/|title= Children of bigger god|publisher=asitlive|accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
In 2002 the MGR Film City was handed over to [[TIDCO]] to develop the area into a knowledge park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= T.S. Shankar|url=http://hindu.com/2002/08/03/stories/2002080301290500.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126013857/http://hindu.com/2002/08/03/stories/2002080301290500.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-26|title= Knowledge park coming up at MGR Film City  |publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film city's proximity to the [[Adyar Film Institute]], [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]] and the [[IT corridor]] was cited as the reason for it to be developed into a knowledge park. TIDCO has plans to build various research facilities for [[biotechnology]] and [[information technology]] in the premise. An international grade movie park was also planned in the film city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= T.S.

In August 2014, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced setting up of two modern studios at a cost of {{INR}} 150 million. These two air-conditioned studios would cover over 2.5 acres within the MGR Government Film and Television Institute campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/tn-to-have-two-modern-cine-studios-in-chennai/article6209373.ece|title= TN to have two modern cine studios in Chennai|newspaper=Business Line|publisher=The Hindu|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=9 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts''' is a database of [[Latter-day Saint]] media and creators. It contains entries on film, music, and writings, as well as directors, composers, and writers. It is "an important critical resource that seeks to comprehensively list literary writings and associated artistic works by and about Mormons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mormonletters.org/?p=960 |title=Mormon LitCrit: Help Us Get It Right? |first=Chris |last=Bigelow |work=Dawning of a Brighter Day |publisher=[[Association for Mormon Letters]] |date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidenced by its name, it launched as a catalogue of Mormon authors and literature in the mid-1990s by Gideon Burton, a [[BYU]] English professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mormonlit.lib.byu.edu/html/credits.html |title=Mormon Literature Database – Credits and History |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further expanded as a [[relational database]] called the '''Mormon Literature Database''' in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcing the Mormon Literature Database |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=231–233 |url=http://dialoguejournal.metapress.com/app/home/content.asp?referrer=contribution&amp;format=2&amp;page=1&amp;pagecount=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was expanded to include other forms of media, and was newly christened Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts (MLCA).

[[Image:Ctrl_alt_del_logo.jpg|right|250px]]
Project '''[[Project ctrl alt del|ctrl_alt_del]]''' was the first [[sound art]] festival realized in Turkey, in September 2003. It was a collaboration between NOMAD, Marres, Hedah, and [[Istanbul Technical University]] Center for Advanced Musical Studies (MIAM). All through the month of September 2003, several events were realized in two cities, [[Istanbul]] and [[Maastricht]]: (i) an introductory presentation, a CD launch, performances by two artists from the Netherlands and Turkey in Marres (Maastricht); (ii) a panel and workshop series at Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Architecture and MIAM; (iii) a series of performances in Babylon, Istanbul during the opening of the 8th International [[Istanbul Biennial]]; (iv) a panel, and performance series at Marres; (v) an exhibition at Marres; (vi) an audio CD which was distributed in Europe through Lowlands, and the international distribution of  the CD-ROM was carried out by NOMAD. ctrl_alt_del aimed at introducing Turkey to sound-art via sound-art’s pioneering names, together with panels and workshops. More than 30 people from 16 different countries contributed to the project in 2003.

In 2005, ctrl_alt_del took place in the “positionings” section of the 9th International Istanbul Biennial. The project launched on September 16, 2005 with an opening night performance at Balans Music hall, then continued on the [[Bosphorus]], the [[Golden Horn]], Istanbul Technical University’s MIAM studios, laboratories, library and concert hall till September 22. The 2005 programme for the ctrl_alt_del project has been developed by Basak Senova, Emre Erkal, Erhan Muratoglu, Pieter Snapper, and Paul Devens. Can Karadogan was responsible for the logistics of ITU activities as the project coordinator and Nusin Odelli was in charge of editing of the printed material. 57 people from 12 countries participated in the project.

In 2007, ctrl_alt_del will be realized by NOMAD in coorporation with Istanbul Technical University – MIAM. This year, ctrl_alt_del will include Opening Concert, Performance Series (live), Workshops, Panels, Presentations, Open Call, Field Studies/Workshops, Exhibition, Radio Programmes, Publication and CD release. The theme of ctrl_alt_del 2007 will be “remote [[orienteering]]”. The theme is not only connected to the navigational systems but it is also about positioning oneself within interconnected social and political realities. The theme will also be processed with the issues of control. It will take place parallel to the 10th International Istanbul Biennial in September. The development team consist of Paul Devens (NL), Can Karadogan (TR), Basak Senova (TR), Eran Sachs (DE/IL), Erhan Muratoglu (TR), and Emre Erkal (TR).

[[File:Bosque de Oma (10).JPG|thumb|right|220px]]

'''Oma forest''' is a work of art created by ''[[Agustin Ibarrola]]'', a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] sculptor and painter. The work is located in a forest near Kortezubi (Bizkaia, [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]), in the natural reserve of Urdaibai. It is also known as the "painted forest".

The work follows the modern art trend called “Land art”. Most of the trees are [[Monterey pine]]s. The projects aims to display the horrible and ghastly harmony between nature and human presence by painting on the trunks of trees, human figures, animals and geometric shapes, some of which are visible only from certain positions.

Agustin is a member of “Basta Ya", a group which aims to aid victims of terrorism. Some 100 trees of the natural reserve were destroyed in 2000 and Oma forest was damaged to protest his stand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Online music education''' is a recent development in the field of [[music education]] consisting of the application of new technologies associated with [[distance learning]] and [[online education]] for the purpose of teaching and learning music in an [[online]] environment mediated by [[computers]] and the [[internet]].

The origins of online music education may be traced to the use of technologies to supplement face-to-face learning in traditional classroom settings, however in recent years it has expanded to include the offering of entire degree programs – even [[doctoral degree]]s – online.  

The rise of technologies leading to the development of online music education is well documented, and  such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007). Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon &amp; Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007). It is likely that more studies will be seen in this high-growth area in the coming years.

== Institutions offering online music education ==
The following is a partial list of North American institutions that offer online degree programs in [[music education]]:

'''''Pastoral Pleasure''''' (French - ''Le Plaisir pastoral'') is a c.1714-1716 [[fête galante]] painting by [[Jean Antoine Watteau]], now in the [[musée Condé]] in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=00000076655|title=JOCONDE entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://srv225.hosteur.com/musee/conde02/voir.xsp?id=00101-4064&amp;qid=sdx_q0&amp;n=7&amp;e=|title=Museum catalogue entry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Watteau paintings survive with extremely similar compositions - the largest and most finished is ''[[The Shepherds (Watteau)|The Shepherds]]'' ([[Schloss Charlottenburg]]), whilst another seems to be a reworking of the Charlottenburg painting (Wildenstein collection). [[Pierre Rosenberg]] argues that the Chantilly version was an oil sketch for the Charlottenburg work. Three other copies of the Chantilly version appeared in 19th and 20th century auctions, but their locations are now unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé.

The Chantilly work belonged to [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], a great Watteau collector - it is mentioned as being in his house from at least 1729, around which time [[Nicolas-Henri Tardieu]] made an engraving after it. On 1 February 1775 it was sold after Mariette's death. According to Edmond Goncourt, it was resold in Paris on 11 May 1789, entering the marquis de Maison's collection, which was acquired in its entirety by the [[Henri d'Orléans (1822-1897)|duc d'Aumale]] in 1868 whilst in exile in the United Kingdom. After moving back to France he hung the work in his [[château de Chantilly]], where it still hangs in the [[musée Condé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 149 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
It shows French aristocrats dressed as shepherds - one couple dances to the right and a young couple court each other on a balcony to the left. The painting also includes real peasants in simpler clothes and with simpler gestures, making it easier to distinguish between them and the aristocrats than in other Watteau paintings such as ''The Shepherds''.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wyngaard, "Switching Codes: Class, Clothing, and Cultural Change in the Works of Marivaux and Watteau", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, vol. 33, no. 4, Summer 2000, p. 523-541&lt;/ref&gt; Several details are directly inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s paintings - the musician, the man next to him, the shepherd embracing the woman next to him and the dog in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé.

The '''Pazin Castle''' ({{lang-hr|Kaštel Pazin}} {{lang-it|Castello di Pisino}}) is a [[medieval]] [[fortification]] built on a solid rock situated in the middle of the town of [[Pazin]], the administrative seat of [[Istria County]], [[Croatia]]. It is the largest and best-preserved castle in that westernmost Croatian county.

It overlooks the deep gorge of the [[Pazinčica]] [[Foiba]] river, a small [[karst]] [[subterranean river]] that disappears there through [[sinkhole]] and continues underground.

The fortified structure was constructed of [[Ashlar|hewn stone]], and, during its 11-century-long history, subjected to several major reconstructions and renovations. Today it is in good condition and houses the Pazin Town Museum.

==History==

The Pazin Castle was first mentioned as ''Castrum Pisinum'' on 7 June 983 in a document issued by [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor]], confirming the possession of the castle to [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Poreč and Pula|bishop of Poreč]]. In the 12th century the bishops of Poreč ceded it to Meinhard of Schwarzenburg, owner of Črnigrad Castle (German: ''Schwarzenburg''), then to [[Meinhard I, Count of Gorizia]], and finally to [[Meinhard, Margrave of Istria]] (d. 1193) and his successors. 

In 1374 Albert IV, Margrave of Gorizia, died without successors and the castle was inherited by the members of the [[House of Habsburg]]. They rented or mortgaged it many times during the next few centuries to various noblemen closely related to them, among which were members of families [[Principality of Auersperg|Auersperg]], Barbo, [[Della Torre]], Devinski, Durr (Dürrer), [[House of Eggenberg|Eggenberg]], Flangini, [[Fugger]], [[Khevenhüller]], Mosconi, Swetkowitz, Turinetti de Prie and Walsee.

The castle was finally sold to Antonio Laderchi de [[Montecuccoli]] in 1766 for 240 [[florin]]s and remained the property of his family until 1945. In the meantime, various countries around the castle changed many times over the last more than 200 years: after the end of the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1797, Pazin belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], then to [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]], again to the Habsburg Monarchy, in 1918 to [[Italy]], in 1945 to [[Yugoslavia]], and in 1991 to [[Croatia]].

For many centuries the castle was the administrative seat of the County of Pazin (Croatian: Pazinska grofovija/Pazinska knežija; Italian: Contado di Pisino; German: Grafschaft Mitterburg) or County of Istria (Croatian: Istarska grofovija/Istarska knežija; Italian: Contea d' Istria; German: Grafschaft Isterreich), governed either by a castle captain [[castellan]], or the count himself.

The '''Pittsburgh Crèche''' is a large-scale [[nativity scene|crèche]], or nativity scene, located on the outside courtyard of the [[U.S. Steel Tower]] in downtown [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. Since 1999, the crèche appears annually during the winter season from November's [[Light Up Night]] to [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in January. It is the only authorized replica of the [[nativity scene]] in [[Saint Peter’s Basilica]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moody|first1=Chuck|title=Downtown crèche going on display Nov. 21|url=http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.php?id=1026|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=Pittsburgh Catholic|date=2003-11-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023050813/http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.php?id=1026|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sponsored by the ecumenical Christian Leaders Fellowship.

==History==
In 1989, the Supreme Court banned a small nativity scene displayed in the Allegheny Courthouse due to its religious implications (in violation of the [[Establishment clause]]) in ''[[County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union]]''.&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray W. Rowney Jr.|title=License to Steal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBSAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT216|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4771-0529-0|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illinois Municipal Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AskqAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Illinois Municipal League.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wake of this ruling, the U.S. Steel Tower erected their own version of a crèche in downtown Pittsburgh, this time on privately owned land. Louis D. Astorino, chairman of the architectural firm L.D. Astorino Companies, traveled to Rome and was inspired to recreate the nativity scene in Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh Crèche Endowment Fund was created in 2006 to raise donations for the crèche construction and restoration each year.

==Design==
The crèche is a replica of the stable constructed by Italian architect Umberto Mezzana. It is 64 feet wide, 42 feet high, and 36 feet long. The human sculptures were designed by Pietro Simonelli.

===Figures===
The number of figures featured in the crèche has increased over time. The original 1999 display featured baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, the Three Kings, two shepherds, and an assortment of animals. The next year, Simonelli added an angel that hung over the crib and more animals. In 2001, a woman and child were added. In 2002, JE Scenic Technologies added a kneeling shepherd, and later, they created a reclining cow. Two more shepherds and two more angels were later included, bringing the total figures in the display to 20.

[[File:Wikipedia Contributor Appendix (Detail).jpg|thumb|left|Wikipedia page from Contributor Appendix (detail)]]

Mandiberg originally thought of the project in 2009 but ran into technical difficulties.  He then engaged an assistant, Jonathan Kirinathan, to aid with the programming of the code to compile, format and upload an entire English Wikipedia download.&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/print-wikipedia-in-7600-volumes-to-sell-for-500000/article7339125.ece "Print Wikipedia, in 7,600 volumes, to sell for $500,000", [[The Hindu]], 22 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  The print files were uploaded to self book publisher [[Lulu.com]] and are available for printout as paper volumes.

Mandiberg's motivation was to answer the question, "How big is it?" For a [[big data]] entity, its size is on the threshold of what can be perceived as a collection of volumes, but not so large as to overwhelm one's senses, such as the data files of [[Facebook]] or the [[NSA]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v2vrn? "Why Print Copies of Wikipedia?" Interview with Michael Mandiberg by [[Dan Damon]], [[BBC]] World Update, 19 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katherine Maher]], the Executive Director of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], has described it as "a gesture at knowledge". Wikimedia has cooperated with the project and Lulu.com has helped fund it.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The task took three years, and the upload process took 24 days, 3 hours and 18 minutes. It was completed on 12 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Print Wikipedia Project Reaches Final Entry|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/print-wikipedia-project-reaches-final-entry/|accessdate=13 July 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[PediaPress]] had attempted to raise money for a full English Wikipedia print out on [[Indiegogo]] in 2014, with a goal of $50,000 (£30,000), but the project was pulled.&lt;ref name="ArtNews"&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/06/24/from-aaaaa-to-zzzap-michael-mandiberg-on-his-plan-to-print-wikipedia/ Hannah Ghorashi, “From AAAAA! ToZZZAP!: Michael Mandiberg on his plan to print Wikipedia”, [[ARTnews]], 24 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
The pulled project had intended to print off 1000 volumes, which would include 1200 pages each- 1,200,000 pages in total and about 80 meters of shelf space&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/27/295262783/printing-wikipedia-would-take-1-million-pages-but-thats-sort-of-the-point&lt;/ref&gt;. Mandiberg later assured people that he won't be printing out the entire collection, claiming an entire collection is not necessary for people to comprehend the true size of Wikipedia, and once people have seen a portion of it, it will help them realize its size.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/print-wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;  
Mandiberg estimates that the printing costs of a full printout are around $500,000. The Denny art exhibit featured only a selection of actually printed volumes with about 2000 of the other volumes represented as spines on the wall. The show revolved around the actual upload of the print files to Lulu.com.&lt;ref name="MutualArt"/&gt;

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|A famous example of the ''Rückenfigur'' motif: [[Caspar David Friedrich]]'s ''[[Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer]]'', 1818]]

The '''''Rückenfigur''''', or figure seen from behind, is a compositional device in painting, graphic art, photography and film. A person is seen from behind in the foreground of the image, contemplating the view before them, and is a means by which the viewer can identify with the image's figure and then recreate the space to be conveyed. It is commonly associated with [[German Romantic]] painting and particularly the landscape painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Koerner|Koerner, Joseph Leo]], ''Caspar David Friedrich and the Subject of Landscape'', 2nd edition, [[Reaktion Books]], 2009, {{ISBN|9781861897503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rückenfigur'' motif dates to antiquity and has since been employed in many different eras and styles of art. Before Friedrich, such figures were not generally the subject of the work. [[Giotto]]'s ''Lamentation of Christ'' (1300s) is any early example of non-subject figures turned from the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Kunibert Bering, Rolf Niehoff (2015),''Visual Proficiency: A Perspective on Art Education''. Athena-Verlag. {{ISBN|9783898967747}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rückenfigur'' may also take the form of [[staffage]]. The trope commonly appears in advertisements.

[[File:Henley regatta temple island.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|The temple on [[Temple Island]], commissioned by '''Sambrooke Freeman''' and designed by [[James Wyatt]] in 1771]]

'''Sambrooke Freeman''' [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (aka '''Sambrook Freeman''', c.1721–1782) was a member of the prominent Freeman family of [[Fawley Court]] near [[Henley-on-Thames]], England.&lt;ref name=gandg&gt;Sambrooke Freeman of Fawley Court. In Roger Kendal, Jane Bowen, and Laura Wortley, ''Genius &amp; Gentility: Henley in the Age of Enlightenment'', [[River &amp; Rowing Museum]], 2002, page 14. {{ISBN|0-9535571-2-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Member of Parliament]], for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]] in [[Yorkshire]] from 1754–61 and [[Bridport (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridport]] in [[Dorset]] from 1768–74.

Sambrooke Freeman was the son of [[John (Cooke) Freeman]], a successful businessman. His first name derived from the Sambrooke family. Due to the Freeman family's rising fortune, Sambrooke Freeman was educated at [[University College, Oxford]], graduating in 1739, followed by an expensive [[Grand Tour]] of [[Italy]] on two trips over nearly four years from 1744.

Freeman lived at Fawley Court, a large house close to the [[River Thames]] north of Henley-on-Thames and just in [[Buckinghamshire]]. He inherited the house on the death of his father in 1752. [[Capability Brown]] was commissioned to work on the grounds of the estate surrounding the house between 1764 and 1766.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Willis, Capability Brown's Account with [[Drummonds Bank]], 1753–1783, ''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'', volume 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman also had the house remodelled by the architect [[James Wyatt]] during the early 1770s is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/houseoxf_fawl.htm Fawley Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224074314/http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/houseoxf_fawl.htm |date=24 February 2009 }}, Oxfordshire. TourUK.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyatt also designed the "temple" (a fishing lodge) on [[Temple Island]] on the river close to Fawley Court in 1771 for Freeman, with [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]]-style murals inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkingclub.org.uk/book_1/walk_01/index.shtml Walk 1: Henley (round walk) — Temple Island, Hambleden &amp; the Great Wood], ''Time Out Country Walks near London'', Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/henley.htm Henley-on-Thames], ''Floating Down the River'', The Harts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Cooper sold [[Phyllis Court]] to Sambrooke Freeman in 1768.&lt;ref name=powys-diary&gt;Emily J. Climenson (editor), ''[https://archive.org/stream/passagesfromdiar00powyuoft/passagesfromdiar00powyuoft_djvu.txt Passages from the Diaries of Mrs. Philip Lybbe Powys]'', Kessinger Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-4365-6715-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also bought the manors of [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]] and [[Remenham]] in the same year.&lt;ref name=gandg /&gt;

Freeman worked on a [[pagoda]] [[fountain]] project for [[Prior Park Landscape Garden|Prior Park]] south of the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] that was never realized.&lt;ref&gt;John Harris, [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2116674 A pagoda fountain for Prior Park: Sambrooke Freeman's unrealized project], ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo: The international magazine of arts]]'', no. 434, pages 9–10, 1998. {{issn|0003-6536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sambrooke Freeman was twice an MP, for [[Pontefract]] and [[Bridport]]. He joined the [[Society of Arts]] in 1756, two years after its formation, and encouraged the involvement of [[Humphrey Gainsborough]] the inventor and [[Thomas Powys (priest)|Thomas Powys]].&lt;ref name=gandg /&gt;

Freeman tried to change the position (to the end of New Street, Henley) and style of the new stone [[Henley Bridge]] so it could form a pleasing view from his house, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/resources/assets/H/Henley_Communics_2___Roads_and_Bridge_615.pdf Henley Communications II: Roads and Bridges — Early Roads]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Victoria County History]]'', [[Oxfordshire]]. Online texts in progress, [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]]. [[University of London]], November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his death in 1782, Fawley Court passed to his nephew, [[Strickland Freeman]]. After his death, his wife lived in [[Henley Park]], a [[dower house]] in the deer park of the Fawley Court Estate. She died on 2 October 1806.&lt;ref name=powys-diary /&gt;

'''Sarah Biffen''' (October 1784&amp;nbsp;– 2 October 1850), also known as Biffin, Beffin,&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|volume=5|page=19|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati05stepuoft#page/19/mode/1up|title=Biffin, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by her married name Mrs E.M. Wright,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarah Biffin, Mrs E.M. Wright, 1784 - 1850. Artist (Self-portrait)|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/54363/sarah-biffin-mrs-em-wright-1784-1850-artist-self-portrait|website=www.nationalgalleries.org|publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland|accessdate=28 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] English [[Mouth and foot painting|painter]] born with no arms. She was {{convert|94|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall.

==Life and work==

Sarah Biffen was born in October 1784 to a family of farmers in [[East Quantoxhead]], [[Somerset]], with no arms and only vestigial legs. Despite her handicap, Biffen learned to read, and later was able to write using her mouth. She could also do [[needlework]] and use scissors.

When Biffen was twelve, her family apprenticed her to a man named Emmanuel Dukes, who exhibited her in [[fair]]s and [[freak show|sideshow]]s throughout England.&lt;ref name=journey&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarah Biffen (1784 - 1850)|url=http://journeyintoart-journeyman.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/sarah-biffen-1784-1850.html|publisher=Journey into art|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some accounts, it was Dukes who taught her to paint, holding the paint-brush in her mouth, in order to increase her value as an attraction. In any case, during this period, she held exhibitions, sold her paintings and autographs, and took admission fees to let others see her sew, paint and draw. She drew [[Landscape painting|landscapes]] or painted [[portrait miniatures]] on [[ivory]], which she sold for three [[guinea (coin)|guineas]] each. Contemporaries praised her skill, and some of her miniatures survive to this day. Dukes apparently promised to give a 1000 guineas if his protégée did not live up to his billing. However, Biffen may have received as little as £5 a year while she was with Dukes.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

[[Image:Sarah Biffen Painting.jpg|thumb|A portrait by Sarah Biffen]]
In the [[Bartholomew Fair|St. Bartholomew's Fair]] of 1808, [[George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton|George Douglas, the Earl of Morton]] wanted to see if Biffen could really paint unaided. Once he was convinced, he sponsored her to receive lessons from a [[Royal Academy of Arts]] painter, [[William Marshall Craig|William Craig]].&lt;ref name=journey/&gt; The [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] awarded her a medal in 1821 for a historical miniature and the Royal Academy accepted her paintings. The [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] commissioned her to paint miniature portraits of them, as a result of which she became very popular. She set up a studio in [[Bond Street]], [[London]]. [[Charles Dickens]] mentioned her in ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'', and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'', and in "A Plated Article", when describing pottery figures spoiled in the firing process.

The Earl of Morton died in 1827. Without the support of a noble sponsor, Biffen ran into financial trouble when her manager used most of her money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarah Biffen&amp;nbsp;— the limbless artisan|url=http://thehumanmarvels.com/127/sarah-biffen-the-limbless-artisan/limbless|publisher=Human marvels|accessdate=17 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511133344/http://thehumanmarvels.com/127/sarah-biffen-the-limbless-artisan/limbless|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] awarded her a [[Civil List]] [[pension]] and she retired to a private life in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=journey/&gt; Some years later she married and 12 years later tried to renew her success with the name Mrs. Wright. The attempt was not successful but her supporters, including [[Richard Rathbone]], arranged a public subscription to finance her for her final years.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Sarah Biffen died on 2 October 1850 at the age of 66. She is buried in [[St James Cemetery]] in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarah Biffen|url=http://www.checkmatebooks.com/biffen.htm|publisher=Checkmate Books|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sculptors Guild continues today as an advocacy organization with a diverse membership. Activities have expanded to include the annual “dressing” of the windows of Saks 5th Avenue, NYC, and participation in exhibitions abroad, such as the 1993 exhibition in Kyoto, Japan, and the 2008 international art fairs at Art Cologne and Supermarket Stockholm. The Sculptors Guild has a presence on New York’s historic Governors Island, with annual indoor and outdoor exhibitions, carving workshops and gallery talks. In 2010 the Sculptors Guild opened a gallery space and office on the second floor in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]]. In September 2016, they moved into an office space on the second floor at the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, in [[Greenwich Village]] at 256 LaGuardia Place, NY, NY 10012 and continue to have summer exhibitions on Governors Island. 

2017 will be the Sculptor Guild's 80th year, and will be celebrated with a momentous member exhibition curated by [[John Yau]] at the historic [[Westbeth Gallery]] for the month of February. This exhibition will include past and current members highlighting the vast forms of sculpture members have explored over past 80 years. 

Membership is by invitation and/or submission to the Admissions Committee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34724">[[File:Versailles chateau.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Palace of Versailles]] (1661–1710)]]
The '''Style Louis XIV''', also called French classicism, was the style of architecture and decorative arts intended to glorify [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] and his reign. It featured majesty, harmony and regularity.  It became the official style during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715), imposed upon artists by the newly established ''[[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) and the ''[[Académie royale d'architecture]]'' (Royal Academy of Architecture). It had an important influence upon the architecture of other European monarchs, from [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia to [[Peter the Great]] of Russia. Major architects of the period included [[François Mansart]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Robert de Cotte]], [[Pierre Le Muet]], [[Charles Perrault]], and [[Louis Le Vau]]. Major monuments included the [[Palace of Versailles]], the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles, and the Church of [[Les Invalides]] (1675–91).

The Louis XIV style had three periods. During the first period, which coincided with the youth of the King (1643-1660) and the regency of [[Anne of Austria]], architecture and art were strongly influenced by the earlier style of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and by the [[Baroque]] style imported from Italy. The early period saw the beginning of French classicism, particularly in the early works of [[Francois Mansart]], such as the [[Chateau de Maisons]] (1630–51). During the second period (1660-1690), under the personal rule of the King, the style of architecture and decoration became more classical, triumphant and ostentatious, expressed in the building of the [[Chateau of Versailles]], first by [[Louis Le Vau]] and then [[Jules Hardouin Mansart|Jules Hardouin-Mansart]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des styles' ' (1988), pg.  120''&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1680, furniture was massive, decorated with a profusion of sculpture and gilding. In the later period, thanks to the development of the craft of [[marquetry]], the furniture was decorated with different colors and different woods. The most prominent creator of furniture in the later period was [[André Charles Boulle]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris (in French), pg. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The final period of Louis XIV style, from about 1690 to 1715, is called the period of transition; it was influenced by Hardouin-Mansart and by the King's designer of fetes and ceremonies, [[Jean Bérain the Elder]]. The new style was lighter in form, and featured greater fantasy and freedom of line, thanks in part to the use of [[wrought iron]] decoration, and greater use of [[arabesque]], [[grotesque]]  and coquille designs, which continued into the [[Louis Quinze|style of Louis XV]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p. 120}}

The model of civic architecture in the early part of the reign was [[Vaux le Vicomte]] (1658), by [[Louis Le Vau]], built for the King's chief of finance [[Nicolas Fouquet]] and completed in 1658. Louis XIV charged Fouquet with theft, put him prison, and took the building for himself. The design was strongly influenced by the classicism of [[François Mansart]]. It combined a facade dominated and rhymed by colossal classical columns, beneath a dome, imported from the [[Italian Baroque architecture]], along with a number of original features, such as a semicircular salon which looked out on the vast [[French formal garden]] created by [[André Le Nôtre]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pg. 122}}

Based on the success of Vaux le Vicomte, Louis XIV selected Le Vau to construct an immense new palace at Versailles, to augment a smaller palace transformed from a hunting lodge by Louis XIII. This gradually became, over the decades, the master work of the Louis XIV style. Following the death of Le Vau in 1680, [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] took over the Versailles project; he broke away from the picturesque projections and dome and made a more sober and uniform facade of columns, with a flat roof topped by a balustrade and row of columns (1681). He used the same style to harmonize the other new buildings he created at Versailles, including the Orangerie and the Stables. Hardouin-Mansart constructed the [[Grand Trianon]] (completed 1687), single-story royal retreat with arched windows alternating with pairs of columns, and a flat roof and balustrade.

Another major new project undertaken by Louis was the construction of a new facade for the east side of the Louvre. Louis invited the most famous sculptor architect of the Italian Baroque, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], to submit a design, but rejected it in favor of a more sober and classical colonnade by [[Claude Perrault|Perrault]] (1668).

==Religious architecture==

In the early period of his reign, Louis began building the church of [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]] (1645-1710), the chapel of the Val-de-Grace hospital. The design was worked on successively by [[Hardouin Mansart|Mansart]], [[Jacques Lemercier]] and [[Pierre Le Muet]] before being completed by [[Gabriel Leduc]]. Its picturesque tripartite facade, peristyle, detached columns, statues, and ''[[Tondo (art)|tondi]]'', make it the most Italianate and Baroque of Paris churches. It served as the prototype for the later domes of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]].{{sfn|Ducher (1988) pg. 124}}

The next major church built under Louis XIV was the church of [[Les Invalides]] (1680-1706). The nave of the church, by [[Libéral Bruant]], was comparable to those of other churches of the period, with ionic pilasters and penetratining vaults, and an interior that resembled the high baroque style. The dome, by Hardouin-Mansart, was more revolutionary, sitting upon a structure with the plan of a [[Greek Cross]]. The design used superimposed orders of columns, in the classical style, but the dome achieved greater height, by resting on a double ''tambour''or drum, and the facade and dome itself were richly decorated with sculptures, ''entablements'' in niches, and ornaments of gilded bronze alternating with the ''nervures'', or ribs of the dome.{{sfn|Ducher (1988) pg. 124}}

The finest church interior of the late Louis XIV period is the chapel of the [[Chateau of Versailles]], created between 1697 and 1710 by [[Hardouin Mansart|Hardouin-Mansart]] and his successor as court architect, [[Robert de Cotte]].  The decor was carefully restrained, with light colors and sculptural detail in slight relief on the columns.  The interior of the chapel opened up and lightened by the use of classical columns placed on the tribune, one level above the ground floor, to support the weight of the vaulted ceiling.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=124}}

== The Grand Style: Paris ==
Though Louis XIV was later accused of having ignored Paris, his reign saw several massive architectural projects which opened up space and ornamented the center of the city. The idea of monumental urban squares surrounded by uniform architecture had begun in Italy, like many architectural ideas of Baroque period. The first such square in Paris was the Place Royal (now [[Place des Vosges]]) begun by [[Henry IV of France]], completed with an equestrian statue of Louis XIII; then the [[Place Dauphine]] on the [[Ile de la Cité]], which featured an equestrian statue of Henry IV. The initial grand Paris projects of Louis XIV were new facades on the Louvre, one facing the Seine, the other facing to the east. These were showcases of the new monumental style of Louis XIV. The old brick and stone of the Henry IV squares was replaced by the Grand Style of monumental columns, which usually were part of the facade itself, rather than standing separately. All the buildings around the square were connected and built to the same height, in the same style. The ground floor featured a covered arcade for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such complex of buildings built under Louis XIV was the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (now the [[Institut de France]]) (1662–68), facing the Louvre. It was designed by [[Louis Le Vau]] and [[François d'Orbay]], and combined the headquarters of the academies founded by the King, a chapel, and the library of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. The [[Les Invalides|Hôtel Royal des Invalides]] - a complex for war veterans consisting of residences, a hospital, and a chapel - was constructed by [[Libéral Bruant]] and [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1671-1679). Louis XIV then commissioned Mansart to construct a separate private royal chapel featuring a striking dome, the Église du Dôme, which was added to complete the complex in 1708.

The next major project was the [[Place des Victoires]] (1684-1697), a real estate development of seven large buildings in three segments around an oval square, with an equestrian statue of Louis XIV planned for the centerpiece. This was built by an enterprising entrepreneur and nobleman of the court, Jean-Baptiste Prédot, combined with the architect Jules Haroudin-Mansart. The final urban project became the best-known, the [[Place Vendôme]], also by Harouin-Mansart, between 1699 and 1702. In another innovation, this project was partially financed by the sale of lots around the square. All of these projects featured monumental facades in the Louis XIV style, giving a particular harmony to the squares.&lt;ref&gt;Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior decoration==
In the early Louis XIV style, the principle characteristics of decor were a richness of materials and an effort to achieve a monumental effect. The materials used included marble, often combined with multicolor stones, bronze, paintings, and mirrors. These were inserted into an extremely framework of columns, pilasters, niches, which extended up the walls and up upon the ceiling. The doors were surrounded with medallions, frontons and bas-reliefs. The chimneys were smaller than those during the Louis XIII era, but more ornate, with a marble shelf supporting vases, below a carved frame with a painting or mirrors, all surrounded by a thick border of carved leaves or flowers. 

Decrative elements on the walls of the early Louis XIV style were usually intended to celebrate the military success, majesty and cultural achievements of the King. They often featured military trophies, with helmets, oak leaves symbolizing victory, and masses of weapons, usually made of glided bronze or sculpted wood, in relief surrounded by marble. Other decorative elements celebrated the King personally: the head of the King was often represented as the sun god [[Apollo]], surrounded by palm leaves or gilded rays of light. An eagle usually represented [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Other ornamental details included gilded numbers, royal batons, and crowns.

The [[Hall of Mirrors]] of the Palace of Versailles (1678-1684) was the summit of the early Louis XIV style.  Designed by [[Charles Le Brun]], it combined a richness of materials (marble, gold, and bronze) which reflected in the mirrors.

In the late Louis XIV period, after 1690, new elements began to appear, that were less militaristic and more fantastic; particularly seashells, surrounded by elaborate sinuous lines and curves; and exotic designs, including [[arabesques]] and [[Chinoiserie]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages 126-129}}

==Furniture==
{{Main|Louis XIV furniture}}
During the first period of the reign of Louis XIV, furniture followed the previous style of Louis XIII, and was massive, and profusely decorated with sculpture and gilding. After 1680, thanks in large part to the furniture designer [[André Charles Boulle]], a more original and delicate style appeared. It was based on the inlay of [[ebony]] and other rare woods, a technique first used in Florence in the 15th century, which was refined and developed by Boulle and others working for Louis XIV.  Furniture was inlaid with plaques of ebony, copper, and exotic woods of different colors.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

New and often enduring types of furniture appeared;  the [[commode]], with two to four drawers, replaced the old ''coffre'', or chest. The ''canapé'', or sofa, appeared, in the form of a combination of two or three armchairs. New kinds of armchairs appeared, including the ''fauteuil en confessionale'' or "Confessional armchair", which had padded cushions ions on either side of the back of the chair.  The console table also made its first appearance; it was designed to be placed against a wall. Another new type of furniture was the ''table à gibier'', a marble-topped table for holding dishes. Early varieties of the desk appeared; the [[Bureau Mazarin|Mazarin desk]] had a central section set back, placed between two columns of drawers, with four feet on each column.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

In the first part of the reign, French painters were largely influenced by the Italians, particularly [[Caravaggio]]. Notable French painters included [[Nicolas Poussin]], who was living in Rome; [[Claude Lorrain]], who specialized in landscapes and spent most of his career in Rome; [[Louis Le Nain]], who, along with his brothers, did mostly genre works; [[Eustache Le Sueur]], and [[Charles Le Brun]], who studied with Poussin in Rome and were influenced by him. 

With the death in 1661 of [[Cardinal Mazarin]], the King's prime minister, Louis decided to take personal charge of all aspects of government, including the arts. His chief advisor on the arts was [[Jean Colbert]] (1619-1683), who was also his finance minister. In 1663 Colbert reorganized the Royal furniture workshops, which made a wide variety of luxury goods, and added to it the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins tapestry workshops]]. At the same time, with the assistance of Le Brun, Colbert took charge of the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]], which had been founded by Cardinal Mazarin. Colbert also took a dominant role in architecture, taking the title of Superintendent of buildings in 1664. In 1666, the French Academy in Rome was founded, to take advantage of Rome's position as the leading art center of Europe, and to assure a stream of well-trained painters. Le Brun became the dean of French painters under Louis XIV, involved in architectural projects and interior design.  His notable decorative works included the ceiling of the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the Palace of Versailles.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=16}}

The major painters of the later reign of Louis XIV included [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]] (1659-1743) who came to Paris in 1681, and attracted the attention of LeBrun.  LeBrun oriented him toward portrait painting, and he made a celebrated portrait of Louis XIV in 1701, surrounded by all the attributes of power, from the crown on the table to the red heels of his shoes. Rigaud soon had an elaborate workshop in place for making portraits of the nobility; he employed specialized artists to create the costumes and draperies, and others to paint the backgrounds, ranging from battlefields to gardens to salons, while he concentrated on the composition, colors and especially the faces.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=16}}

[[George de la Tour]] (1593-1652) was another important figure in the Louis XIV style; he was given a title, named court painter of the King, and received high payments for his portraits, though he rarely ever came to Paris, preferring to work in his home town of [[Lunéville]]. His paintings, with their unusual light and dark effecs, were unusually somber, the figures barely seen in the darkness, lit by torchlight, evoking meditation and pity. In addition to religious scenes, he did genre paintings, including the famous ''Tricheur'' or card cheat, showing a young noble being cheated at cards while others look on passively. The writer and later French culture minister [[Andre Malraux]] wrote in 1951, "No other painter, not even Rembrandt, ever suggested such a vast and mysterious silence. La Tour is the only interpreter of the serene aspect of shadows."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Bauer and Prater, ''Baroque'', (2016) page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, Louis XIV's tastes changed again, under the influence of his morganic wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]], toward more religious and meditative themes. He had all the paintings in his private room removed and replaced by a single canvas, ''Saint Sebastien being tended by Saint Irene'' (c. 1649) by Georges de la Tour.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=86}}

==Sculpture==
The most influential sculptor of the period was the Italian [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], whose work in Rome inspired sculptors all over Europe. He traveled to France; his proposal for a new facade of the Louvre was rejected by the King, who wanted a more specifically French style, but the Bernini did make a bust of Louis XIV in 1665 which was greatly admired and imitated in France.

One of the most prominent sculptors under Louis XIV was [[Antoine Coysevox]] (pronounced "qualzevo") (1640-1720) from Lyon. He studied sculpture under [[Louis Lerambert]] and copied in marble ancient Roman works, including the [[Venus de Medici]]. In 1776, his bust of the King's official painter [[Charles Le Brun]] won him admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He was soon producing monumental sculpture to accompany the new buildings constructed by Louis XIV; he made a Charlemagne for the royal chapel at [[Les Invalides]], and then a large number of statues for the new Park at Versailles and then at the [[Chateau de Marly]]. He originally made the outdoor statues in weather-resistant stucco, then replaced them with marble works when they were finished in 1705. His work of Neptune from Marly is now in the Louvre, and his statues of Pan and a Flora and Dryad are now found in the [[Tuileries Gardens]]. His statue of ''The King's Fame riding Pegasus'' was originally made for the Chateau of Marly. After the Revolution it was moved to the Tuileries Gardens, and is now inside the Louvre. He also made a series of greatly admired portrait sculptures of the leading statesmen and artists of the time; Louis XIV at Versailles, Colbert (for his tomb at the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Church of Saint Eustache]]; [[Cardinal Mazarin]] in the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (now the Institut de France) in Paris; the playwright [[Jean Racine]]; the architect [[Vauban]] and the garden designer [[Andre Le Notre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Coysevox, Charles Antoine'', by Hugh Chisholm from Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition, (1911), pg. 355-56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Sarazin]] was another notable sculptor working on projects for Louis XIV. He made many statues and decorations for the Palace of Versailles, as well as the [[Caryatids]] for the eastern facade of the Pavilion du Horloge of the Louvre, facing the Cour Carré, which were based both on a study of the original Greek models, and on the work of [[Michelangelo]].

Another notable sculptor of the Style Louis XV was [[Pierre Paul Puget]] (1620-1694), who was a sculptor, painter, engineer and architect. He was born in Marseille, and first sculpted ornaments for ships under construction. He then travelled to Italy, where he worked as an apprentice on the Baroque ceilings of the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Palazzo Pitti]]. He travelled back and forth between Italy and France, painting, sculpting and wood-carving. He made his celebrated statue of [[caryatids]] for the city hall of Toulon in 1665-67, then was employed by [[Nicolas Fouquet]] to make a statue of Hercules for his chateau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]. He continued to live in th south of France, making notable statues of Milo of Croton, Perseus and Andromeda (now in the Louvre).&lt;ref&gt;''Puget, Pierre,'', by Hugh Chisholm from Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition, (1911), pg. 637&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tapestries==
In 1662 [[Jean Baptiste Colbert]] purchased the tapestry workshop of a family of Flemish artisans and transformed it into a royal workshop for the manufacture of furniture and tapestries, under the name of [[Gobelins tapestry]]. Colbert placed the workshop under the direction of the royal court painter, [[Charles Le Brun]], who served in that position from 1663 until 1690. The workshop worked closely with the major painters of the court, who produced the designs. After 1697 the enterprise was reorganized, and thereafter was devoted entirely to the production of tapestries for the King.&lt;ref&gt;"Gobelin". Encyclopædia Britannica. Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911).  Cambridge University Press. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes and styles of the tapestry were largely similar to the themes in the paintings of the period, celebrating the majesty of the King and triumphal scenes of military victories, mythological and pastoral scenes. While at first they were made only for use of the King and nobility, the factory soon began exporting its products to the other courts of Europe.

The royal Gobelins manufactory had competition from two private enterprises, the [[Beauvais Manufactory]] and the [[Aubusson tapestry]] workshop, which produced works in the same style but with a low-warp process, with slightly lesser quality. [[Jean Bérain the Elder]], the royal draftsman and designer of the King, created a series of grotesque carpets for Aubusson. These tapestries sometimes celebrated contemporary themes, such as a work designed by Aubusson An late 17th to early 18th century tapestry done by the Beauvais Manufactory depicting Chinese astronomers at the Beijing Ancient Observatory using new more accurate instruments brought to them by Europeans (Jesuits) which were installed in 1644.

==Design and spectacle==
In the early years of the King's reign, the most important public royal ceremony was the ''[[carrousel]]'',  a series of exercises and games on horseback. These events were designed to replace the tournament, which had been banned after 1559 when King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was killed in a jousting accident. In the new, less dangerous version, riders usually had to pass their lance through the interior of a ring, or strike mannequins with the heads of Medusa, Moors and Turks. A grand ''carrousel'' was held on June 5–6, 1662 to celebrate the birth of the ''Dauphin'', the son of Louis XIV. It was held on the square separating the Louvre from the Tuileries Palace, which afterwards became known as the Place du Carrousel.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=754}}

The ceremonial entry of the King into Paris also became an occasion for festivities. The return of Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Thérèse to Paris after his coronation in 1660 was celebrated by a grand event on a fairground at the gates of the city, where large thrones were constructed for the new monarchs. After the ceremony the site became known as the Place du Trône, or place of the Throne, until it became the [[Place de la Nation]] in 1880.{{sfn|''Dictionnaire historique de Paris''|2013|page=272}}

An office existed in the royal household of Louis XIV called [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi]], which was responsible the decoration at royal ceremonies and spectacles, including ballets, masques, illuminations, fireworks, theater performances and other entertainments. This office was held from 1674 to 1711 by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] (1640-1711). He was also designer of the King's bedchamber and offices, and had an enormous influence upon what became known as the Style Louis XIV; his studio was located in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, along with those of the royal furniture designer [[André Charles Boulle]]. He was particularly responsible for introducing the a modified version of the [[grotesque]] style of ornament, originally created in Italy by Raphael, into French interior design. He used the grotesque stele not only on wall panels, but also on tapestries made by the [[Aubusson tapestry]] workshops. His many varied other designs included the highly-ornate design of transom of the warship ''Soleil Royal'' (1670), named for the King.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Bérain, Jean". Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to interior decoration, he designed the costumes and scenery for the royal theaters, including for the opera ''[[Amadis (Lully)|Amadis]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] performed at the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Theater of the Palais Royal]] (1684), and for the opera-ballet ''Les Saisons'' by Lully's successor, [[Pascal Colasse]], in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

==The garden ''à la Française''==
One of the most enduring and popular forms of the Style Louis XIV is The ''Jardin à la française'' or [[French formal garden]], a style based on [[symmetry]] and the principle of imposing order on nature. The most famous example is the [[Gardens of Versailles]] designed by [[André Le Nôtre]], which inspired copies all across Europe. The first important garden à la française was the Chateau of [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], created by [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the superintendent of Finances to Louis XIV, beginning in 1656. Fouquet commissioned [[Louis Le Vau]] to design the chateau, [[Charles Le Brun]] to design statues for the garden, and [[André Le Nôtre]] to create the gardens. For the first time, that garden and the chateau were perfectly integrated. A grand perspective of 1500 meters extended from the foot of the chateau to the statue of the Hercules of Farnese; and the space was filled with parterres of evergreen shrubs in ornamental patterns, bordered by colored sand, and the alleys were decorated at regular intervals by statues,  basins, fountains, and carefully sculpted topiaries.  "The symmetry attained at Vaux achieved a degee of perfection and unity rarely equalled in the art of classic gardens. The chateau is at the center of this strict spatial organization which symbolizes power and success."&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, ''Histoire des jardins'', pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gardens of Versailles, created by [[André Le Nôtre]] between 1662 and 1700, were the greatest achievement of the Garden à la francaise. They were the largest gardens in Europe – with an area of 15,000 hectares, and were laid out on an east–west axis followed the course of the sun: the sun rose over the Court of Honor, lit the Marble Court, crossed the Chateau and lit the bedroom of the King, and set at the end of the Grand Canal, reflected in the mirrors of the Hall of Mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, ''Histoire des jardins'', pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the grand perspectives, reaching to the horizon, the garden was full of surprises – fountains, small gardens filled with statuary, which provided a more human scale and intimate spaces. The central symbol of the Garden was the sun; the emblem of [[Louis XIV]],  illustrated by the statue of [[Apollo]] in the central fountain of the garden. "The views and perspectives, to and from the palace, continued to infinity. The king ruled over nature, recreating in the garden not only his domination of his territories, but over the court and his subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suspense''' is a state of mental [[uncertainty]], [[anxiety]], of being [[Decision-making|undecided]], or of being [[Doubt|doubtful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[Drama|dramatic work]], suspense is the [[anticipation]] of the [[wikt:outcome|outcome]] of a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the solution to an uncertainty, [[puzzle]], or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as it affects a character for whom one has [[sympathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.

== In drama ==
In literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest.  It may be of several major types:  in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of ''who, what, or how''; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of ''when''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about ''what'' will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don’t know ''how'' it will happen.  It would be difficult (and perhaps pointless) to write a piece of fiction in which there were not some issue the reader had a burning wish to find out about.  Consequently, even in [[historical fiction]], with characters whose life stories are well known, the ''why'' usually brings suspense to the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adjunct to suspense is [[foreshadowing]], as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in [[Isabel Allende]]’s ''[[House of the Spirits]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* In [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (429 B.C.), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father.  During the play, the spectators, aware that Oedipus will eventually make the discovery, share the hero's uncertainties and fears as he pursues the truth of his own past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[George Washington Cable]]'s story "Jean-ah Poquelin" (1875), the reader wants to know the cause of the strange smell and the unexplained disappearance of a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1895), the reader anticipates the outcome of the switching of a black infant with a white infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ernest J. Gaines]]'s ''[[A Gathering of Old Men]]'' (1983), the reader waits for the court's decision at a murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradox of suspense ==
Some authors have tried to explain the "paradox of suspense", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yanal|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name ''rappel'' this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (''suspense par contradiction'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007|pp=279–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Geographer''''' is a painting created by Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] in 1668–1669, and is now in the collection of the [[Städelsches Kunstinstitut]] museum in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It is closely related to Vermeer's ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'', for instance using the same model in the same dress, and has sometimes been considered a [[pendant painting]] to it. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson, C.

==Description==
[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The Astronomer'' has been considered a pendant to ''The Geographer'']]

This is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'').

The geographer, dressed in a Japanese-style robe then popular among scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; is shown to be "someone excited by intellectual inquiry", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. "The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right."&lt;ref name=awjvtcw&gt;Wheelock (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's ''[[Mistress and Maid]]''), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. Carr asserts that the painting depicts a "flash of inspiration" or even "revelation". The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table&amp;mdash;pushed back&amp;mdash;are both symbols of revelation. "He grips a book as if he's about to snatch it up to corroborate his ideas."&lt;ref name=scvahw&gt;Cant (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt, Faust.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Faust depicted in an etching by [[Rembrandt]] (c. 1650). Faust, also a scholar, is depicted in the same pose as ''The Geographer'', although facing in roughly the opposite direction.]]

The globe was published in Amsterdam in 1618 by [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; Terrestrial and celestial globes were commonly sold together, and the celestial globe in ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' "was also a Hondius (Hendrick rather than Judocus)", another indication that the two paintings were created as pendant pieces, according to Cant. The globe is turned toward the Indian Ocean, where the [[Dutch East India Company]] was then active. Vermeer used an impasto technique to apply [[pointillé]] dots, not to indicate light reflected more strongly on certain points but to emphasize the dull ochre cartouche "frame" printed on the globe. Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions&amp;mdash;reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting.&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|150px|thumb|left|Vermeer's possible model, [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]], painted two decades later by [[Jan Verkolje]]]]

The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. The sea chart on the wall of "all the Sea coasts of Europe" has been identified as one published by [[Willem Jansz Blaeu]]. This accuracy indicates Vermeer had a source familiar with the profession. ''The Astronomer'', which seems to form a pendant with this painting, shows a similar, sophisticated knowledge of cartographic instruments and books, and the same young man modeled for both. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Wheelock and others assert the model/source was probably [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632-1723), a contemporary of Vermeer who was also born in Delft. The families of both men were in the textile business, and both families had a strong interest in science and optics. A "microscopist", van Leeuwenhoek was described after his death as being so skilled in "navigation, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and natural science ... that one can certainly place him with the most distinguished masteres of the art." Another image of van Leeuwenhoek (by the Delft artist [[Jan Verkolje]]) about 20 years later shows a broad face and straight nose, similar to Vermeer's model. At the time Vermeer painted the two works, the scientist would have been about 36 years old. He would have been actively studying for his examination for surveyor, which he passed on February 4, 1669. There is no documentary evidence for any kind of relationship between the two men during Vermeer's lifetime, although in 1676, van Leeuwenhoek was appointed a trustee for Vermeer's estate.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The pose of the figure in Vermeer's painting "takes up precisely the position of [[Faust]] in [[Rembrandt]]'s famous etching" (although facing the opposite direction), according to [[Lawrence Gowing]]. Similar arrangements can be found in drawings by [[Nicolaes Maes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gowing (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and exhibitions==
[[File:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|150px|A less-detailed image of the painting, with more accurate coloring]]
[[File:Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelven pryzen p 242.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1720 catalog listing the work.]]
For much of the painting's early history (until 1797), it was owned together with ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'', which it strongly resembles, and the two have long been considered pendants, although their measurements are not identical. The paintings were not among the works in the Dissius sale of 1696, a collection apparently originally owned by the artist's supposed patron, [[Pieter van Ruijven]], and the earliest record of the painting is from 1713. Up until the late 18th century, they were referred to as "Astrologers". The pair were sold by an anonymous owner together in Rotterdam on April 27, 1713 (No. 10 or 11), for 300 florins (a "considerable sum", according to Wheelock). [[Hendrik Sorgh]], an art broker, may have bought the paintings at that point. They were among his effects when he died in 1720, and both were sold on March 28 of that year in Amsterdam (No. 3 or 4 in the sale; for 160 florins; described as "An Astrologer" and "a repeat"). Govert Looten, a neighbor of Sorgh at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam bought the paintings, which were sold from his estate on March 31, 1729 (this painting was No. 6 and went for 104 florins, both were described in the catalog as "sublimely and artfully painted"). Jacob Crammer Simmonsz of Amsterdam (1725-1778) owned the pair before 1778, hanging them in his home on the Prinsengracht (Simonsz also owned ''[[The Lacemaker (Vermeer)|The Lacemaker]]'' and another Vermeer, now unknown, depicting a lady pouring wine). He sold ''The Astronomer'' and ''The Geographer'' together on November 25 of that year to a Huguenot banker, Jean Etiènne Fizeaux of Amsterdam, who owned ''The Geographer'' until his death in 1780. His widow owned the work until perhaps 1785. As of 1794 it was owned by Jan Danser Nijman of Amsterdam, who sold it on August 16, 1797 to Christiaan Josi, a publisher of prints, for 133 guilders. It later was bought by Arnoud de Lange of Amsterdam. This transaction separated the two paintings. De Lange sold it on December 12, 1803 for 360 florins.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Sometime before 1821, the painting was owned by Johann Goll van Franckenstein Jr. of Velzen and Amsterdam. Pieter Hendrick Goll van Franckenstein of Amsterdam owned it before 1832, and he sold it on July 1, 1833 for 195 florins to a Nieuwenhuys. It was owned by Alexandre Dumont of Cambrai before 1860, who sold it through Thoré-Bũrger to Isaac Pereire of Paris, who owned it by 1866. It was sold on March 6, 1872. Max Kann of Paris owned the painting, perhaps that year, and it passed into the hands of Prince Demidoff of [[Demidov Collection|San Donato]], near Florence, sometime before 1877, and stayed in his hands until he sold it on March 15, 1880. A.J. Bosch sold the painting in Vienna on April 28, 1885 (for Õs 8,000) to a Kohlbacher, who sold it to the Stãdelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The work was exhibited in the ''Exposition rétrospective, Tableaux anciens empruntés aux galeries particulières'' held at the Palais des Champs-Elysées, Paris, 1866 ; at the exhibition of ''Ouvrages de peinture exposés au profit de la colonisation de l'Algérie par les Alsaciens-Lorrains'', Palais de la Présidence du Corps législatif, Paris, 1874 ; and in the ''Vermeer, oorsprong en involved. Fabritius, de Hooch, de Witte'' exhibition at the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam, 1935.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

'''''The Hussite Sermon''''' (German - ''Die Hussitenpredigt'') is a painting by the [[Düsseldorf]]-based painter [[Carl Friedrich Lessing]], showing an open-air sermon being delivered by a [[Hussite]] preacher in the 15th century. It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin.

In 1834 [[Frederick William IV|Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] saw an oil sketch on the subject by Lessing in 1834 and commissioned him between 1835 and 1836 to produce a full-scale version. The mainly-Catholic Rhineland had recently been annexed to the Protestant-dominated [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by the [[Congress of Vienna]] and so the work was seen as a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda for the area's Protestant minority. In the context of the Restoration of the German princes to their thrones and the [[Vormärz]], others also saw it as a criticism of the repressiveness of the states and systems put in place by Metternich and the Congress. Middle-class audiences saw it as an expression of opposition to kingly and church authority alike. It was briefly exhibited in Germany and Paris, spreading the reputation of the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]].

'''''Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Benjamin Radford]], an American writer and investigator. The book documents Radford's five-year investigation into accounts of the [[chupacabra]]. The chupacabra is said to be a vampiric predatory animal that drains the blood of animal victims while avoiding human detection.

==Overview==
The author, Benjamin Radford, attempts to solve the mystery of the [[chupacabra]], including whether it is a legend or real animal, what its physical and behavior characteristics are, its origin and connection to folklore, and what exactly is happening to the animals reported to be its victims.

''Tracking the Chupacabra'' documents Radford's five-year investigation, including his travels into the mysteries surrounding the chupacabra. It also includes his research, with interviews and documentation collected during this process.

Opening with "The Goatsucker Mystery," Radford introduced the essential portions of the [[chupacabra]] legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another, [[Bigfoot]], which he writes is known for leaving large footprints. In his overview Radford summarized theories concerning the origin of the chupacabra, some paranormal or religious in nature, and interviewed several [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]].

In "A Brief history of Vampires," Radford wrote about common themes of vampire folklore. While exploring 18th-century accounts of European vampires, Radford notes that reports of vampire predation are used to explain otherwise unexplained misfortunes, such as disease, malnutrition, or loss of livestock. 

"Chupacabras in Popular Culture" described how, in Radford's view, the legend grew in Puerto Rico from observations by locals of apparent animal predations into rumors of a mysterious creature that was responsible. According to Radford, the news media leapt to conclusions, which, in his opinion, further drove alleged sightings and reports, to the extent that "any odd event"&lt;ref name="radford-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} was attributed to the chupacabra.

The chapter "Searching for Chupacabras in Nicaragua" deals with Radford's investigation in [[Nicaragua]] near the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|Río San Juan]], where one of the best known alleged chupacabra remains had been discovered. While performing a physical search for the animal, Radford interviewed local experts, such as guide Fernando Casanova of Nicaragua's Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, about the local understanding of the chupacabra's "character or description," as well as examining tracks found in the area and comparing them to casts reportedly taken from scenes surrounding chupacabra victims.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|66–72}}

In "The Dead Vampires Speak: Chupacabra Carcasses," Radford discussed the analyses of various recovered corpses put forward as candidates for identification of the chupacabra animal. "The Curious Case of the Cuero Chupacabra" covers the analysis of a carcass of the American canid version of the chupacabra, discovered by a rancher in Cuero, Texas. The chapter also discusses Radford's participation in an episode of [[MonsterQuest#Season two .282008.29|MonsterQuest]], which aired in 2008 during the series' second season. Having analyzed the various forms of chupacabra remains and reports, in "Reconsidering the Goatsucker," Radford attempted to determine the origins of the chupacabra creature.

Radford concluded his investigation with the chapter "The Zoology of Chupacabras and the Science of Vampires." Compiling reports of researchers who examined victims of animal predation in apparent chupacabra attacks, Radford noted that the reports' claims that the animals had been [[Exsanguination|exsanguinated]] were inaccurate. The apparent loss of blood could be explained by internal hemorrhaging and pooling of blood at the bottom of the corpse. The attribution of the attacks on livestock to a vampiric entity can be explained by the puncture wounds resulting from the canine teeth left by most predators, who often instinctively go for the neck, according to taxidermist Jerry Ayer.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|165}} Radford attributes much of the spread of chupacabra sightings to factors including the mass media (especially the Internet and television shows), eyewitness misperceptions, ignorance of forensic science, social contagion, and mass hysteria,&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|166}} and concludes that "every supposedly mysterious detail of the bloodsucking 'monster-thing' and its victims was explained."&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|169}}

Matt Crowley, reviewing the book for ''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in July 2011, recapped Radford's process of tracing the origins of reported chupacabra sightings, tracking the changing physical attributes of the creature based on its description as reports journeyed from Puerto Rico eventually traveling to the United States.&lt;ref name="crowley-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley praised what he described as the "elegance" of Radford's investigation, stating that it "lies in the process of the proof, not just the result."&lt;ref name="crowley-2011" /&gt;

Reviewing ''Tracking the Chupacabra'' for ''[[Library Journal]]'', Janet Tapper described Radford as "thorough in his investigation; interviewing witnesses, providing creepy photographs of otherworldly creatures, serving up DNA analysis, and contemplating theories of [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]]." Tapper recommended the work, stating "this objective probe will appeal to readers interested in exploring and exploding modern mysteries."&lt;ref name="tapper-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book for the ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'', [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]'s Virginia Fugarino stated that "to date, few books have been dedicated to taking a serious look at this creature," and commented on Radford's treatment of folklore, saying "he particularly explores how the chupacabra and other Latin American vampiric creatures can be seen to represent metaphorically postcolonial concerns and resentment of intrusion from outside political forces, specifically the U.S. government."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While criticizing Radford for what Fugarino states is an "at times [...] dismissive tone toward individuals who believe in the creature," she stated that the work was "clear and well presented."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011" /&gt;

The [[American Folklore Society]] invited Radford to speak at its 2011 Annual Meeting, where he presented an abstract, "The Chupacabra and Folklore."&lt;ref name="american-folklore-society-2011a"&gt;

[[Cryptozoology|Cryptozoologist]] [[Karl Shuker]] performed a review of Radford's work in a March 2012 issue of ''[[Fortean Times]]'', stating that "the chupacabra has met its match," recommending the book's "scientific detachment and common sense" for readers looking for those traits.&lt;ref name="shuker-2012"&gt;

In a review for ''Aztlán'', an interdisciplinary journal of [[Chicano|Chicano studies]] published by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[San Diego State University]]'s William A. Nericcio wrote that "the power of Radford's work is the depth of his research." Nericcio went on to discuss the impact of Radford's investigation on the dialogue regarding the cultural impact of the chupacabra in the Latin American community. According to Nericcio, "the rise of evangelical churches in Latin America and the American Southwest [...] coincides with sightings of the chupacabra and the virus-like spread of its mythology," referring to the perceived connection by some proponents between the chupacabra and satanic or occult phenomena.&lt;ref name="nericcio-2012"&gt;

A reviewer for ''The Latin Americanist'', the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s J. Justin Castro noted that chupacabra reports have "captured the imagination of people around the world," and praised Radford's "insightful and entertaining book," stating that "Radford sets the record straight, debunking many of the myths about the goatsucker." While Castro criticized some of Radford's arguments concerning feelings of U.S. exploitation of Puerto Rico as "largely unfounded," Castro stated that "His concluding arguments, on the other hand, are more viable. He makes a strong case that cinema greatly influenced the chupacabra phenomenon."&lt;ref name="castro-2012"&gt;

Tim Hull, in ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'', stated that "Radford's most interesting revelations are about the psychological and sociopolitical structures behind the folklore, especially as they relate to the monster's origins in Puerto Rico, where some people believe that the chupacabra is a secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong." Hull also went on to say that "While Radford's book—which is well-written and a fun read—should be the last word on the chupacabra's real-world existence, it won't be. As the author points out, the beast has entered the realm of conspiracy, where no amount of evidence, or logic, can sway the true believer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hull|first=Tim|title=Debunking Chupacabra: The managing editor of 'Skeptical Inquirer' says no to a mythical beast|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/debunking-chupacabra/Content?oid=2950786|work=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Koester, in ''[[El Paso Times]]'', called Radford's book "[...] an enjoyable ride." Koester also went on to say that "The legend doesn't hold up well under Radford's scientific microscope, but the curious will still love this tour through the tall tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koester|first=Jay|title=No monsters here: Investigator locates the chupacabra in legend only|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/living/ci_18017017|work=El Paso Times|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanne Boyett, in the Cibola County Beacon, stated that "Radford questions documented reports and the resulting conclusions. But the author’s criticisms leave him vulnerable to accusations of racial prejudice, particularly the references to eyewitnesses’ reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyett|first=Rosanne|title=Tracking the Chupacabra|url=http://www.cibolabeacon.com/features/book-review/article_7ff87270-9303-544e-9372-ce24d5aa6416.html?mode=story|work=Cibola County Beacon|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine stated that "[...] Tracking the Chupacabra is by no means another collection of witness accounts and unsubstantiated facts. The author has not only gone on an expedition to find the elusive beast (complete with all the expected disappointment) but has researched just about every reported Chupacabra encounter with the journalistic zeal of Woodward and Bernstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking the Chupacabra: A fascinating book regarding the chupacabra in America|url=http://www.fatemag.com/inside-fate/book-reviews/tracking-the-chupacabra/|work=Fate Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for [[The Skeptics Society]], [[Sharon A. Hill]] called the book "[...] satisfying for those willing to consider a legitimate, evidence-based explanation." Hill went on to say that "I’m hard pressed to find any stone unturned in this stunning exposé of the first Internet-age cryptid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Sharon | authorlink=Sharon A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.

'''''Woman with a Water Jug''''', also known as '''''Young Woman with a Water Pitcher''''', is a painting finished between 1660–1662 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] in the [[Baroque]] style. It is oil on canvas, 45.7cm x 40.6 cm, and is on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]]. 

==Description==
A young woman is found in the center of the picture. She is opening a window with her right hand, while she holds a water jug with her left hand. This jug rests on a larger platter. Both of these, among other objects, are upon on a table. This is decorated with a red-colored tablecloth. Behind the table stands a chair upon which lies a blue material. The woman gazes out the window. The clothing of the woman consists of a dark blue dress with a black and gold overpiece. A white cloth serves as her headpiece. A map hangs in the background on the wall. 

This painting is one of a closely related group painted in the early to mid-1660s as the artist was not using linear perspective and geometric order and the light was his only source of emphasis.

==Provenance==
''Young Woman with a Water Pitcher'' was purchased by [[Henry Gurdon Marquand]] in 1887 at a Paris gallery for $800. When Marquand brought it to the United States, it was the first Vermeer in America. Marquand donated the artwork along with other pieces in his collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. &lt;ref&gt; [http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Henry_Gurdon_Marquand_Papers_b17500448.pdf Finding aid for the Henry Gurdon Marquand Papers, 1852-1903].&lt;/ref&gt;
