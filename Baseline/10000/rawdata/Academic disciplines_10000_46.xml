{{Antennas|systems}}

'''Antenna farm''' or '''satellite dish farm''' or just '''dish farm''' are terms used to describe an area dedicated to [[television]] or [[radio]] [[telecommunications]] transmitting or receiving antenna equipment, such as [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Band (radio)|band]] [[satellite dish antenna]]s, [[UHF]]/[[VHF]]/[[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[transmitter]] towers or mobile [[cell tower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - antenna farm |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKQy6iM?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlZJno4LsLwC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=Antenna+farm&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=SshGSvyxOI_wyASWr_VR&amp;client=opera Wireless telecom FAQs By Clint Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3LR9ZlSv-4C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=antenna+farm&amp;ei=s5UQStGfIYmkzATSoM3rBw&amp;client=opera Wireless Crash Course By Paul Bedell]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiber-optics.info/articles/l-band_satellite_transport Fiber-Optics.Info - L-Band Satellite Transport]&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term "antenna farm" is uncertain, but it dates to at least the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Five Ideco Towers Take the Punishment at the Nation's Most Antenna Farm," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 14 October 1957, 79. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-10-14-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In telecom circles, any area with more than three antennas could be referred to as an antenna farm. In the case of an AM broadcasting station ([[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], occasionally [[shortwave]]), the multiple [[mast radiator]]s may all be part of an antenna system for a single station, while for VHF and UHF the site may be under [[joint venture|joint management]].  Alternatively, a single tower with many separate antennas is often called a "[[candelabra]] tower".&lt;ref&gt;Google Book Search - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xTSNJhVlHGgC&amp;pg=PT977&amp;dq=candelabra+tower&amp;num=100&amp;ei=IJoQSoe2DpHGzATV4NCVAQ&amp;client=opera Antenna engineering handbook By Richard Clayton Johnson, Henry Jasik]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety and security ==

Commercial antenna farms are managed by [[radio station]]s, [[television station]]s, satellite [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleport]]s or military organizations and are mostly very [[security|secure]] facilities with access limited to [[broadcast engineer]]s, [[RF engineering|RF engineer]]s or [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] [[Engineering technician|technician]]s.  This is not only for the physical security of the location (including preventing [[Electrical equipment|equipment]]/[[metal theft]]), but also for safety, as there may be a [[radiation]] hazard unless stations are powered-down.

== Locations ==
[[Image:Mt Wilson antenna farm winter.jpeg|thumb|right|Antennas on [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], covered in ice]]
Where [[terrain]] allows, [[summit|mountaintop]] sites are very attractive for non-AM [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast station]]s and others, because it increases the stations' [[height above average terrain]], allowing them to reach further by avoiding obstructions on the ground, and by increasing the [[radio horizon]].  With a clearer [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] in both cases, more signal can be received.  While the same is true of a very tall tower, such towers are expensive, dangerous, and difficult to access the top of, and may collect and drop large amounts of ice in winter, or even [[Structural failure|collapse]] in a severe ice storm and/or high winds.  Multiple small towers also allow stations to have backup facilities co-located on each other's towers for [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].

Satellite antenna farms are usually located at remote locations, far away from urban development, especially high rise buildings or airplane flight paths, to avoid and minimize disruption to transmission and reception, and so as to not be an eyesore. Although most radio and TV stations are in fierce competition with each other in their broadcast markets, they will often locate their broadcasting antennas very near each other, and in some cases, will even share land or towers with each other, in the interests of space, land availability, and the cost of putting a transmission building on top of a mountain.

===In the United States===
[[Image:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 3.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The dish farm at the [[Raisting Satellite Earth Station]] complex and Telehouse, Germany's largest satellite communications facility in [[Raisting]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Penobscot Hill.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[antenna farm]] on [[Penobscot Knob]] before the coollapse of [[WNEP-TV]]'s tower]] --&gt;

Most [[metropolitan area]]s have at least one antenna farm, such as [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] in [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles]] (seen at right), [[Sweat Mountain]] in [[metro Atlanta]], [[Farnsworth Peak]] for the [[Salt Lake Valley]], [[Riverview, Florida|Riverview]] in [[Tampa]], Florida, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Woodberry, Baltimore#Television Hill|Television Hill]] and [[Slide Mountain (Nevada)|Slide Mountain]] ([[Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe|Mount Rose ski area]]) in the [[Reno]]/[[Lake Tahoe|Tahoe]] area.  Some cities instead have combined many stations onto one tower, often through [[diplexer]]s into just one or two antennas, such as atop the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York metropolitan area|New York]], the landmark [[Sutro Tower]] of [[San Francisco]], or the huge [[Miami Gardens]] tower serving the [[south Florida metropolitan area|Miami and Fort Lauderdale region]]. [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has its antenna farm in the suburb of [[Parma, Ohio]] due to Parma's high elevation. In central [[Oklahoma City]] most of the city's media outlets transmitter and tower facilities are located between the [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]] to the south and [[Interstate 44]] to the north, Broadway Extension to the west and [[Interstate 35]] to the east with Britton Road being the central thoroughfare. In addition, all three network affiliates and one of the 3 major radio groups have their studio facilities located within the [[Oklahoma City]] tower farm.

In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the Eastern United States, [[Poor Mountain]] serves most of the FM and TV stations in the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]/[[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] market. [[Holston Mountain]] in upper East Tennessee is home to most of the FM and TV stations in the Tri-Cities ([[Bristol, Virginia]]-[[Kingsport, Tennessee]]-[[Johnson City, Tennessee]]) DMA.  Other examples are [[Signal Mountain, Tennessee|Signal Mountain]] near Chattanooga, Tennessee, [[Sharp's Ridge]] in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paris Mountain in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].

Other examples of co-located towers on mountain peaks in the United States are on Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama; [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] near Los Angeles; the [[Sutro Tower]] in Clarendon Heights near [[Mount Sutro]] in San Francisco; [[Lookout Mountain, Colorado]] near Denver; Cedar Hill between Dallas and Fort Worth; [[South Mountain Park]] near Phoenix; Nelson Peak near Salt Lake City; [[Sandia Crest]] near Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

Probably the most famous broadcast antenna farm of all is the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Tower One, on which many of the New York City television and several FM stations had their antennas. All were lost when Twin Towers One and Two collapsed after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. Most of those stations now broadcast from their previous home, 200 feet lower, on the Empire State Building.

==Objections==

Antenna farms have often been the source of complaints from local neighborhoods, particularly when a new tower is added.  This has been increasingly so for [[TV station]]s, which have been pursuing with alacrity the construction of new [[digital television]] antennas.  Because many of these towers are already full, or were built well before there was the expectation of DTV, many stations have been forced to go through the even greater expense of constructing a new tower.

One such situation was in [[Colorado]], in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.  Many of the [[Denver metropolitan area]] TV stations already transmitted analog TV from [[Lookout Mountain (Colorado)|Lookout Mountain]], but needed the extra space for more antennas.  Additionally, since many people live on Lookout Mountain, there was also the concern about safety, not only from falling ice or even the slight risk of a tower collapse, but also ongoing from the additional RF that it would create.  Residents and the city of [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] filed legal objections, including challenging the authority of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to override denial of [[zoning]] permits by local government (in this case, the [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson]] [[county commission]]).  The city of Golden also sought to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the site, even though it was outside city limits.  It was decided that scenic [[Eldorado Mountain]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] might be a better site, but there were also objections that it would ruin the view of that mountain from the valley.  Despite other alternatives, the new "supertower" was forced on Lookout Mountain by the [[U.S. Congress]], allowing the existing towers to be removed in 2009 after [[analog shutdown]].  The site began operating in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-visions.com/itv-denvertower1.html Media Visions Journal - Denver DTV 'Supertower'Faces Local Resistance by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2004/04/12/story8.html Denver Business Journal - HDTV tower project delayed by Amy Bryer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://tv-technology.com/article/19858 Denver Lookout Mountain TV Tower Finished by Doug Lung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcast Engineering]] - [http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 Dielectric completes Lookout Mountain DTV transmission project serving Denver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012214629/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/65788 Denver Finally Gets its DTV by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BOP''' ('''b'''enzotriazol-1-yl'''o'''xytris(dimethylamino)'''p'''hosphonium hexafluorophosphate) '''reagent''' is a [[reagent]] commonly used in the synthesis of [[peptides]].  Its use is discouraged because coupling using BOP liberates [[HMPA]] which is carcinogenic, although for small scale use in an organic laboratory this is not a great disadvantage as it is in large scale industrial usage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">The '''Bass Model''' or '''Bass Diffusion Model''' was developed by [[Frank Bass]].  It consists of a simple [[differential equation]] that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact. The basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as [[innovators]] or as imitators and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovativeness and the degree of imitation among adopters. The Bass model has been widely used in [[forecasting]], especially new products' [[sales forecasting]] and [[technology forecasting]]. Mathematically, the basic Bass diffusion is a [[Riccati equation]] with constant coefficients.

In 1969, Frank Bass published his paper on a new product growth model for consumer durables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Management Science |accessdate=September 22, 2016 |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=1833–1840 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.1976&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=Comments on "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables": The Bass Model |first=Frank M. |last=Bass |year=2004 |quote=Perhaps the first thing to notice about the paper that has come to be known as the "Bass Model" (Bass 1969) is the title. It contains a typo. The paper was published with the title: "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables." The correct title should be: "A New Product Growth Model for Consumer Durables." |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0300}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1833}}&lt;ref name="Bass1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bass |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Bass  |year=1969 |title= A new product growth for model consumer durables |journal=Management Science |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=215–227 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, [[Everett Rogers]] published ''Diffusion of Innovations'', a highly influential work that described the different stages of product adoption. Bass contributed some mathematical ideas to the concept.&lt;ref name="MgtScienceDec2004"&gt;''Management Science'' 50 Number 12 Supplement, Dec 2004 {{issn|0025-1909}} p1833-1840&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model formulation==
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + q F(t)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the change of the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ p &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of innovation
* &lt;math&gt;\ q &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of imitation

Sales &lt;math&gt;\ S(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of installed base (i.e. adoption) &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the ultimate market potential &lt;math&gt;\ m &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=mf(t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=m{ \frac{(p+q)^2}{p}} \frac{e^{-(p+q)t}}{(1+\frac{q}{p}e^{-(p+q)t})^2} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

The time of peak sales &lt;math&gt;\ t^* &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ t^*=\frac{\ln q - \ln p}{p+q} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

===Explanation===
The coefficient ''p'' is called the coefficient of innovation, external influence or advertising effect.  The coefficient q is called the coefficient of imitation, internal influence or word-of-mouth effect.

Typical values of ''p'' and ''q'' when time ''t'' is measured in years:&lt;ref name="Empirical Generalizations"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahajan |first=Vijay |author2=Muller, Eitan |author3=Bass, Frank |year=1995 |title=Diffusion of new products: Empirical generalizations and managerial uses |journal=Marketing Science |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=G79–G88 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mksc.14.3.G79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The average value of ''p'' has been found to be 0.03, and is often less than 0.01
*The average value of ''q'' has been found to be 0.38, with a typical range between 0.3 and 0.5

[[image:Bass adopters.svg]]

==Extensions to the model==
===Generalised Bass model (with pricing)===

Bass found that his model fit the data for almost all product introductions, despite a wide range of managerial decision variables, e.g. pricing and advertising.  This means that decision variables can shift the Bass curve in time, but that the shape of the curve is always similar.

Although many extensions of the model have been proposed, only one of these reduces to the Bass model under ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name=Bass1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bass|first=Frank M.|author2=Trichy V. Krishnan |author3=Dipak C. Jain |title=Why the Bass Model Fits without Decision Variables|journal=Marketing Science|date=1994|volume=13|issue=2|pages=203–223|doi=10.1287/mksc.13.3.203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[image:Bass diffusion model.svg|right]] This model was developed in 1994 by Frank Bass, Trichy Krishnan and Dipak Jain:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = (p + {q}F(t)) x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is a function of percentage change in price and other variables

===Successive generations===
Technology products succeed one another in generations.  Norton and Bass extended the model in 1987 for sales of products with continuous repeat purchasing.  The formulation for three generations is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=John A.|author2=Frank M. Bass|title=A Diffusion Theory Model of Adoption and Substitution for Successive Generations of High-Technology Products|journal=Management Science|date=1987|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1069–1086|doi=10.1287/mnsc.33.9.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{1,t} = F(t_1) m_1 (1-F(t_2)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{2,t} = F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 ) (1-F(t_3)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{3,t} = F(t_3) (m_3 + F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 )) &lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;\ m_i = a_i M_i &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ M_i &lt;/math&gt; is the incremental number of ultimate adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ a_i &lt;/math&gt; is the average (continuous) repeat buying rate among adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ t_i &lt;/math&gt; is the time since the introduction of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t_i) = \frac{1-e^{-(p+q)t_i}}{1+\frac{q}{p} e^{-(p+q)t_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

It has been found that the p and q terms are generally the same between successive generations.

===Relationship with other s-curves===
There are two special cases of the Bass diffusion model.

*The first special case occurs when q=0, when the model reduces to the [[Exponential distribution]].
*The second special case reduces to the [[logistic distribution]], when p=0.

The Bass model is a special case of the Gamma/[[shifted Gompertz distribution]] (G/SG): Bemmaor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Bemmaor | given=Albert C. | year= 1994 |pages=201–223| chapter=Modeling the Diffusion of New Durable Goods: Word-of-Mouth Effect Versus Consumer Heterogeneity | editor=G. Laurent, G.L. Lilien &amp; B. Pras | title=Research Traditions in Marketing | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | place=Boston| isbn=0-7923-9388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1994) 

'''Use in online social networks'''
The rapid, recent (as of early 2007) growth in online social networks (and other [[virtual communities]]) has led to an increased use of the Bass diffusion model.  The Bass diffusion model is used to estimate the size and growth rate of these social networks. The work by Christian Bauchkage and co-authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last= |first= |author-link= |eprint=1406.6529 |title=Strong Regularities in Growth and Decline of Popularity of Social Media Services|class= cs.SI|date= |last1= Bauckhage|first1= Christian|last2= Kersting|first2= Kristian|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the Bass model provides a more pessimistic picture of the future than alternative model(s) such as the Weibull distribution and the shifted Gompertz distribution.

==Adoption of this Model ==
The model is one of the most cited empirical generalizations in marketing; as of October 2018 the paper "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables" published in Management Science had (approximately) 8499 citations in Google Scholar&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C45&amp;q=A+New+Product+Growth+for+Model+Consumer+Durables&amp;btnG=&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This model has been widely influential in marketing and management science.  In 2004 it was selected as one of the ten most frequently cited papers in the 50-year history of ''Management Science''.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;  It was ranked number five, and the only marketing paper in the list.  It was subsequently reprinted in the December 2004 issue of Management Science.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7058">'''Biomarkers of aging''' are [[biomarker]]s that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than will chronological age.&lt;ref  name="BakerGT"&gt;{{cite journal | author=George T. Baker, III and Richard L. Sprott | title=Biomarkers of aging | journal=Experimental Gerontology | volume=23 | issue=4–5 | year=1988 | pages=223–239 | id= | pmid=3058488 | doi=10.1016/0531-5565(88)90025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stated another way, biomarkers of [[ageing|aging]] would give the true "biological age", which may be different from the chronological age.

Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to [[life extension|extend lifespan]], because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;  Although [[maximum lifespan]] would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] would take far too much time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison, Ph.D. | first = David E. | title = V. Life span as a biomarker | publisher = [[Jackson Laboratory]] | date = November 11, 2011 | url = http://research.jax.org/faculty/harrison/ger1vLifespan1.html | accessdate = 2011-12-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015835/http://research.jax.org/faculty/harrison/ger1vLifespan1.html | archivedate = April 26, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of [[ageing]] and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;

Although [[Human hair color#Gray and white hair|graying of hair]] increases with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Neste D, Tobin DJ | title=Hair cycle and hair pigmentation: dynamic interactions and changes associated with aging | journal=MICRON | volume=35 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=193–200 | id= | pmid=15036274 | doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, [[wrinkle|skin wrinkles]] and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologists]] have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 [[memory T cell]]s and [[naive T cell]]s have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miller RA | title=Biomarkers of aging: prediction of longevity by using age-sensitive T-cell subset determinations in a middle-aged, genetically heterogeneous mouse population| journal=Journals of Gerontology | volume=56 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=B180–B186 | id= | pmid=11283189 | doi=10.1093/gerona/56.4.b180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[big data]] analysis allowed for the new types of "aging clocks" to be developed. The [[epigenetic clock]] is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid24138928"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Horvath S | title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal=[[Genome Biology]]  | volume=14 | issue=10 | year=2013 | pages=R115  | url = http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/r115  | pmc = 4015143 |pmid=24138928 | doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age.&lt;ref name="pmid27191382"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zhavoronkov A |title=Deep biomarkers of human aging: Application of deep neural networks to biomarker development |journal= Aging |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2016 |pages= 1021–33 |url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/SzdNR3HCatAdyvwPR/text |pmc= 4931851 |pmid= 27191382 |doi= 10.18632/aging.100968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies of the [[hematological clock]] on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.&lt;ref name= "pmid29340580"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Population Specific Biomarkers of Human Aging: A Big Data Study Using South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European Patient Populations |journal= The Journals of Gerontology: Series A |volume= 6 |issue= 11 |pages= 1482–1490 |year=2018 |author= Polina Mamoshina, Kirill Kochetov, Evgeny Putin, Franco Cortese, Alexander Aliper, Won-Suk Lee, Sung-Min Ahn, Lee Uhn, Neil Skjodt, Olga Kovalchuk, Morten Scheibye-Knudsen, Alex Zhavoronkov |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi= 10.1093/gerona/gly005 |pmid= 29340580 |pmc= 6175034 |via= (text: [https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/gly005/4801287#111582158 link])}} &lt;/ref&gt;
It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the [[transcriptomic clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The transcriptional landscape of age in human peripheral blood |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=8570 |year=2015 |author= Peters M |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9570 |pmid=26490707 |pmc=4639797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A broader acceptance of biomarkers of aging, however, will depend on a better understanding of the observed correlations to the incidence of specific diseases, improved transferability of the models across populations and reduction of costs of the studies. The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. 
Consequently, modern [[deep learning]] techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the [[NHANES]] study).&lt;ref name="pmid 29581467"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tim Pyrkov, Konstantin Slipensky, Mikhail Barg, Alexey Kondrashin, Boris Zhurov, Alexander Zenin, Mikhail Pyatnitskiy, Leonid Menshikov, Sergei Markov, and Peter O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4024">The '''Child Language Data Exchange System''' ('''CHILDES''') is a [[speech corpus|corpus]] established in 1984 by [[Brian MacWhinney]] and [[Catherine E. Snow|Catherine Snow]] to serve as a central repository for first [[language acquisition]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its earliest transcripts date from the 1960s, and it now has contents (transcripts, audio, and video) in 26 languages from 130 different corpora, all of which are publicly available worldwide.  Recently, CHILDES has been made into a component of the larger corpus [[TalkBank]], which also includes language data from [[aphasia|aphasics]], [[second language acquisition]], [[conversation analysis]], and classroom language learning.  CHILDES is mainly used for analyzing the language of young children and the child directed speech of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corpus linguistics: Investigating language structure and use |first=Douglas |last=Biber |authorlink=Douglas Biber |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521499576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, as computational resources capable of easily manipulating the data volumes found in CHILDES became commonly available, there was a significant increase in the number of studies of child language acquisition that made use of it.  CHILDES is currently directed and maintained by [[Brian MacWhinney]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

==Database Format==
There are a variety of languages and ages represented in the CHILDES transcripts.  The majority of the transcripts are from spontaneous interactions and conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The transcriptions are coded in the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) transcription format, which provides a standardized format for producing conversational transcripts. This system can be used to transcribe conversations with any type of language learner: children, second-language learners, and recovering aphasics.  In addition to discourse level transcription, the CHAT system also has options for [[phonological]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] analysis.  The [[CLAN program]] was developed by Leonid Spektor and aids in transcription and analysis of the child language data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000723/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''catkin''' or '''ament''' is a slim, cylindrical [[flower]] cluster (a [[spike (botany)|spike]]), with inconspicuous or no [[petal]]s, usually [[wind]]-[[pollination|pollinated]] ([[anemophily|anemophilous]]) but sometimes insect-pollinated (as in ''[[Salix]]'').  They contain many, usually [[plant sexuality|unisexual]] flowers, arranged closely along a central stem which is often drooping.  They are found in many [[plant]] families, including [[Betulaceae]], [[Fagaceae]], [[Moraceae]], and [[Salicaceae]]. For some time, they were believed to be a key [[synapomorphy]] among the proposed [[Hamamelididae]], also known as Amentiferae (''i.e.'', literally plants ''bearing aments''). Based on [[molecular phylogeny]] work, it is now believed that Hamamelididae is a [[polyphyletic]] group.&lt;ref name="Salvolainen et al. 2000"&gt;Savolainen, V., M. W. Chase, S. B. Hoot, C. M. Morton, D. E. Soltis, C. Bayer, M. F. Fay, A. Y. De Bruijn, S. Sullivan, and Y.-L. Qiu. 2000. Phylogenetics of flowering plants based on combined analysis of plastid ''atpB'' and ''rbcL'' gene sequences. Systematic Biology 49:306-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soltis2011"&gt;Soltis, D. E. et alii. (28 authors). 2011. "Angiosperm phylogeny: 17 genes, 640 taxa". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''98'''(4):704-730. {{doi|10.3732/ajb.1000404}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the catkin flower arrangement has arisen at least twice independently by [[convergent evolution]], in [[Fagales]] and in [[Salicaceae]].&lt;ref name="Cronk et al. 2015"&gt;Cronk Q. C. B., Needham I., and Rudall P. J. 2015. Evolution of catkins: inflorescence morphology of selected Salicaceae in an evolutionary and developmental context. ''Frontiers in Plant Science''. 2015; 6: 1030. {{doi|10.3389/fpls.2015.01030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a convergent evolution raises questions about what the [[ancestral]] inflorescence characters might be and how catkins did evolve in these two lineages.

In many of these plants, only the male flowers form catkins, and the female flowers are single ([[hazel]], [[oak]]), a cone ([[alder]]) or other types ([[mulberry]]).  In other plants (such as [[Populus|poplar]]) both male and female flowers are borne in catkins.

Catkin-bearing plants include many other [[trees]] or [[shrub]]s such as [[birch]], [[willow]], [[hickory]], [[chestnut|sweet chestnut]] and  [[sweetfern]] (''Comptonia'').

The word ''catkin'' is a [[loanword]] from the old [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''katteken'', meaning "kitten", on account of the resemblance to a [[kitten]]'s tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catkin|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ament'' is from the [[Latin]] ''amentum'', meaning "thong" or "strap".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ament|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50007124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
In Britain, they can be seen in January or February, when many trees are bare for winter.  They can even occur in December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150127-an-early-hazel-catkin-year An early catkin year]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Celtic cross''' is a form of [[Christian cross]] featuring a [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] or ring that emerged in [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A type of [[ringed cross]], it became widespread through its use in the stone [[high cross]]es erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelized by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]], from the 9th through the 12th centuries.

A staple of [[Insular art]], the Celtic cross is essentially a [[Latin cross]] with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the [[Celtic Revival]] of the 19th century; the name "Celtic cross" is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.

==Early history==

[[File:032Galarus Oratory.JPG|thumb|Early forms: pillar stone, [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland]]

[[Ringed crosses]] similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the [[Ardagh chalice]]. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone [[high cross]]es, a distinctive and widespread form of [[Insular art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrs Q6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 193–195|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, which first appeared in the 9th century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base.&lt;ref name=Herren1&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|page= 199|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early [[Coptic cross]]es based on the [[ankh]]. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in [[Christian art]]. Crosses with a ring representing the [[celestial sphere]] developed from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. The "cosmological cross" is an important motif in [[Coelius Sedulius]]'s poem ''[[Carmen Paschale]]'', known in Ireland by the 7th century.&lt;ref name=Herren2&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 199–200|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the 9th century and occur in two groups: at [[Ahenny]] in Ireland, and at [[Iona]], an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona's influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in [[Pictish stone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of crosses bear inscriptions in [[ogham]]: an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Ardboe High Cross]], the crosses at [[Monasterboice]], the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]] and those in Scotland at [[Iona]] and the [[Kildalton Cross]], which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in [[Cornwall]], including [[St Piran]]'s cross at [[Perranporth]], and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Arthur G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: J. Pollard&lt;/ref&gt; Other stone crosses are found in the former [[Northumbria]] and [[Scotland]], and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the [[Ruthwell Cross]] for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.

Popular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by [[Saint Patrick]] or possibly [[Saint Declan]], though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the [[sun cross]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ's supremacy over the pagan sun.

== Modern times ==

===Celtic Revival===
The [[Celtic Revival]] of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, [[Henry O'Neill (illustrator)|Henry O'Neill]] published ''Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland''. These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.

New versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the Isle of [[Iona]] in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexander-ritchie.co.uk/history.htm "A Brief History of the Ritchies"], Alexander Ritchie website, accessed 20 Nov 208&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Celtic cross in fashion is still popular today.

&lt;/Gallery&gt;

Since its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers. Straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The [[Church in Wales]] since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8637">'''Co-processing''' is the use of [[waste]] as raw material, or as a source of energy, or both to replace natural mineral resources (material recycling) and fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and gas ([[energy recovery]]) in industrial processes, mainly in energy intensive industries (EII) such as [[cement]], [[Lime mortar|lime]], [[steel]], [[glass]], and [[power generation]]. Waste materials used for Co-processing are referred to as alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR).

==Concept of Co-processing==
Co-processing is a proven [[sustainable development]] concept that reduces demands on natural resources, reduces pollution and landfill space, thus contributing to reducing the [[environmental footprint]]. Co-processing is also based on the principles of [[industrial ecology]], which considers the best features of the flow of information, materials, and energy of biological ecosystems, with the aim of improving the exchange of these essential resources in the industrial world.

[[image:Types of Co-processing.gif]]

Figure 1: Types of Co-processing

In summary, the benefits of Co-processing are:
* to conserve natural (non-renewable) resources of energy and materials,
* to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow global warming and demonstrate a positive impact on integrated environmental indicators, such as the [[ecological footprint]],
* to reduce the environmental impacts of the extraction (mining or quarrying), transporting, and processing of raw materials,
* to reduce dependence on primary resource markets,
* to save landfill space and reduce the pollution caused by the disposal of waste, and
* to destroy waste completely eliminating potential future liabilities.

Co-processing contributes to the industrial competitiveness, is a complementary technology to concepts such as [[cleaner production]] or [[recycling]] and should be considered as a treatment alternative within an integrated waste management concept. Some EII offer co-processing as a sustainable waste management service. It is usually more cost effective to adapt existing facilities of EII than building new waste treatment capacities thereby reducing waste management cost to society.

The waste management hierarchy (see figure below) shows that Co-processing is a recovery activity which should be considered after waste prevention and recycling; Co-processing ranks higher in this hierarchy in comparison to disposal activities such as landfilling or incineration.

[[image:Waste hierarchy.gif]]

Figure 2: Waste Management Hierarchy

==Potential of Co-processing==

The global industrial demand for energy is roughly 45% of the total demand and the requirements of the energy intensive industries (EII) are more than half of the total industrial demand, at 27%.

Worldwide, wastes suitable for Co-processing have an energy potential equivalent to nearly 20% of the fossil fuel energy used by the EII and coal-fired power plants. By 2030, the thermal substitution rate of waste could rise to nearly 30%. In the [[EU-25]]  countries of Europe, the available energy potential in waste currently represents nearly 40% of this demand, and this is expected to rise to almost 50% by 2030.

The EU cement industry already uses more than 40% fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process. Although the choice for this so-called alternative fuels (AF) is typically cost driven, other factors are becoming more important. Use of AF provides benefits for both society and the company: CO2-emissions are lower than with fossil fuels, waste can be co-processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced. Yet there are large differences in the share of AF used between the European Union (EU) member states. Clearly, the societal benefits can be enlarged if more member states increase their AF share. In this study Ecofys assess the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of AF in 14 EU member states. Ecofys found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself. In this summary they present the overall findings. The detailed assessments are available in separate cases studies.[https://cembureau.eu/media/1618/full-report-_-2017-05-11_ecofys_publication_alternativefuels_report.pdf Source]

Roughly 60% of the waste that could be used for Co-processing is biomass and therefore [[carbon neutral]]. In this way Co-processing offers a significant potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Furthermore, diverting industrial waste streams from landfills and incinerators without energy recovery contributes to reducing overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions when used to substitute fossil fuels through Co-processing (as illustrated in the figure below).

[[image:Reduction of Emissions through Co-Processing.gif]]

Figure 3: Reduction of Emissions through Co-processing

Other factors that must be considered when Co-processing waste include product quality standards, permitting aspects, and transparent communication in order to gain public acceptance.

==Coprocessing in Pharmaceutical Excipients Development==
Coprocessing is the combination of two or more excipients to form materials (coprocessed excipients) of superior functionality and limited unwanted effects. Co-processing is a tool that is employed by pharmaceutical excipients manufacturers and formulation scientists to develop materials with superior performance. Coprocessing is fundamentally based on particle engineering that allows modification of Critical Material Attributes (CMA) of the primary excipients. These modifications are reflected in the resulting coprocessed material as enhanced functionality. The primary excipients are established pharmacopoeial materials.

'''Constructive journalism''' is an emerging domain within [[journalism]] that is slowly getting grounded within academia&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/ "Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology"]. "University of Pennsylvania Scholarly Commons". 1 August 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Alexander L. &amp; Hammonds, Keith H.  [http://engagingnewsproject.org/enp_2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ENP_SJN-report.pdf "The Power of Solutions Journalism"]. "University of Texas at Austin". 1 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
and involves the field of communication that is based around reporting solution-focused news, instead of revolving only around negative and conflict-based stories. The idea behind constructive journalism is to give stories more context and make the consumer of the news more intelligent. By giving more background and also reporting what is going good, so that people are more able to create a realistic view of the world. Instead of only reporting the issues, with constructive journalism the journalist also addresses what the consumer can do with the information. What can I do to change it? etc. 

The journalist does not reflect his or her opinion and also does not render or implement what those solutions are, but tries to inform the society of what solutions there might be. Pioneers of constructive journalism say that as a journalist you have a big impact on the way people think, because of the way you construct the news. Journalists need to be aware of that responsibility more by being more careful in the way they construct their stories.

Constructive journalism aims express how change is possible and highlights the role each member of society may play to foster it. Additionally, it strives to strengthen the ethics code of journalism by avoiding the distortion of information in order to provide a more real portrayal of the world. Constructive Journalism attempts to create an engaging narrative that is factually correct without exaggerating numbers or realities.

== Applications ==

According to the Danish journalist [[Cathrine Gyldensted]], the Canadian [[Family therapy|family systems therapist]] [[Karl Tomm]]'s four types of therapeutic questioning can be adopted into an interview approach that can also be used by journalists.&lt;ref name="positivenews"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine. [http://positivenews.org.uk/2014/culture/media/16246/challenge-power-anew-family-therapy/ "How can we challenge power anew? Try family therapy"]. ''Positive News''. 12 September 2014. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomm's original framework provides four types of questions a therapist can use in [[psychotherapy]] sessions to bring about positive therapeutic outcomes from clients. By using the same model in journalism, similarly constructive answers could be obtained from the interviewee.

In what he named the "interventive interviewing" devised to facilitate positive changes in family dynamics, Tomm divides questions into four types based on two intersecting dimensions that make up four quadrants.&lt;ref name=tomm&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomm |first=Karl |title=Interventive Interviewing: Part III. Intending to Ask Lineal, Circular, Strategic, or Reflexive Questions? |journal=Family Process |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date=March 1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00001.x |url=http://www.familytherapy.org/documents/Interventive3.PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGiTJ-Z_y6Q Karl Tomm og de 4 spørgsmålstyper (Karl Tomm and the 4 types of question)]. ''YouTube.com''. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension of intentionality differentiates between "orienting questions" that help interviewers (therapists) orient their views about the interviewees (clients) and "influencing questions" that challenge the interviewees' (clients') understanding of themselves. When used outside psychotherapy, such as in journalism, this dimension of intentionality is also interpreted as the temporal dichotomy between past-orientation and future-orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Myllerup, Bent. [http://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2013/10/07/your-strategy-asking-powerful-questions/ "Your Strategy for Asking Powerful Questions"]. ''agile42''. 7 October 2013. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second dimension of linear vs. circular assumptions, theoretically based on [[Gregory Bateson]]'s works on the nature of mind,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Steps to an ecology of mind''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Mind and nature: A necessary unity''. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between lineal assumptions that take a reductionist, deterministic approach and circular assumptions that take a holistic, systemic approach. The resulting four types of questions are:
# Linear Questions ("The Detective"): Basic investigative questions that deal with "Who did what?, Where?, When?, and Why?". This type of questions helps discover the factual aspect of the problem or issue.
# Circular Questions ("The Anthropologist"): This type of questions discovers relevant contextual perspective behind the facts. Examples: "How did this affect you (or other things/people/etc.)?" and "What is your explanation for A or B?".
# Reflexive Questions ("The Future Scientist"): In reflective questions, the interviewer suggests a new perspective on a given topic, thereby nudging the interviewee to reflect on a new possibility of constructive solutions to the problem or issue. Examples: "What do you think A believes, when he is in that situation?", "How would you approach this problem?", and "What action should be taken in order to do A or B?"
# Strategic Questions ("The Captain"): Directs the interviewee into commitment of the solution. Examples: "What should be done?", "Will you do it?", and "When will you do it?"

Gyldensted reports that conventional journalists tend to be past-oriented and hence leave out future-oriented questions, especially the "Future Scientist". &lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; For example, in a four-hour press conference with a former Danish prime minister, the press asked 59% "Detective", 19.4% "Captain", 18.7% "Anthropologist", and only 3% "Future Scientist" questions out of a total of more than 130 questions. "As a consequence," she writes, "[journalists] miss out on asking questions that explore new perspectives, solutions and visions, and on triggering actions based on those perspectives." An ideal, constructive interview requires a balance among all four types of questions, because "[a]n interview containing all four roles of questioning [...] reveals the problem and the involved parties (Detective), provides reflection on what has happened (Anthropologist), points towards a solution or maps a bigger vision (Future Scientist), and commits decision-makers (Captain)." These four types of questions, being grounded in family therapy, is especially effective in [[political journalism]], because the interviewer can encourage "mediation in political debates" and hence facilitate constructive collaboration among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine.

== Media corporations working with Constructive Journalism ==

In Scandinavia this domain has been evolving since 2007. 
In December 2007 the editor-in-chief and CEO of Danish Media corporation Berlingske Media, Lisbeth Knudsen, wrote an editorial where she reflected on the natural but also detrimental effects of journalism's negativity bias, and called for more positive and constructive story ideas.&lt;ref name=lk&gt;Knudsen, Lisbeth [http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ "Gode historier er negative historier"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221181806/http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ |date=2014-12-21 }}.

==Synopsis==
In this book Seife concentrates on the [[information theory]], discussing various issues, such as decoherence and probability, relativity and [[quantum mechanics]], works of [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], entropy and superposition, etc.

==Review==
{{quote|The cosmos, as Seife depicts it, is a great big information swap meet. Objects enormous and minuscule are always encountering other objects and being affected by them in such a way that they “gather information” — not consciously, of course, but in the way that the mercury collected information about my boiling syrup. A pool ball that’s hit by another pool ball receives information about the speed and direction of the ball that hit it. [[Subatomic particles]] do the same. Of course, subatomic particles do a lot of things that are much more baffling than this, like existing in two different places at the same time until someone or something tries to locate them. But, as Seife argues, information still lies at the root of all this. “Decoding the Universe” offers a history of the development of information theory, too, beginning with the [[cryptographers]] of World War II.}}

The term [[dyslexia]] comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words 'dys' meaning 'impaired', and 'lexis' meaning 'word' and is used to describe disorders of language concerning reading and [[spelling]].

Numerous models and hypotheses have been proposed in attempt to explain the broad range of symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery seen is not experienced equally in all patients.

Deep dyslexia is mainly characterized by the occurrence of [[Semantics|semantic]] reading errors or semantic [[paralexias]] (transposition of letters or words) when reading aloud (e.g. the written word "view" is read aloud as "scene", the word "bird" is read as "canary").&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaut|first=David C.|author2=Shallice, Tim|title=Deep dyslexia: A case study of connectionist neuropsychology|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1993|volume=10|issue=5|pages=377–500|doi=10.1080/02643299308253469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weekes|first=Brendan|author2=Coltheart, Max |author3=Gordon, Evian |title=Deep dyslexia and right hemisphere reading-a regional cerebral blood flow study|journal=Aphasiology|year=1997|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1139–1158|doi=10.1080/02687039708249437}}&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic errors are the major distinguishing feature of deep dyslexia in comparison to other central dyslexias.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; There are many other symptoms of deep dyslexia, including visual errors (e.g. the written word "thing" is read aloud as "think", the word "skate" is read as "scale") and derivational errors (e.g. the written word "alcohol" is read aloud as "alcoholic", the word "governor" is read as "government"), and poor reading of [[function word]]s.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt; Additionally, deep dyslexics have more difficulty reading [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] than [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and highly imaginable words, more difficulty reading [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[verb]]s than [[noun]]s, a complete inability to read [[Pseudoword|non-words]], and often impairments on tasks of verbal [[working memory]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Trevor|title=The psychology of language : from data to theory|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Hove|isbn=978-0-86377-867-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Bryan|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0-7167-9586-8|edition=6th|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the symptoms of deep dyslexia listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some of the characteristics of it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark symptom of the disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coltheart|first=Edited by Max|title=*Deep dyslexia.|year=1980|publisher=Routhledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-0456-7|edition=[1st publ.].|author2=Patterson, Karalyn |author3=Marshall, John C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in deep dyslexia being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax" /&gt;

===Imageability effect and ease of predication===

The difficulty of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has been referred to as the "[[imageability]] effect".&lt;ref name= "Temple" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=GV|title=Deep dyslexia, imageability, and ease of predication.|journal=Brain and Language|year=1985|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=3971130|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(85)90094-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Riley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=EA|author2=Thompson, CK|title=Semantic Typicality Effects in Acquired Dyslexia: Evidence for Semantic Impairment in Deep Dyslexia.|journal=Aphasiology|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6–8|pages=802–813|pmid=20657815|doi=10.1080/02687030903422486|pmc=2907924}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, the ease with which a [[mental image]] can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; This variable, [[ease of predication]], is a rating of how easy it is to come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=Trevor A.|title=Connectionist approaches to language disorders|journal=Aphasiology|year=1993|volume=7|issue=3|pages=221–249|doi=10.1080/02687039308249508}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when presented with the word "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]], such as "has four legs", "is an animal", or "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2" /&gt; Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

There are many different, and often conflicting, hypotheses that attempt to explain the deficits associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Shallice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories have resulted in several models designed to conceptualize the symptom-complex found in deep dyslexics. These models are not ordered chronologically, but rather follow a general increasing trend of presence in the field of knowledge regarding deep dyslexics. Some models may be stronger than others, but that is not necessarily reflected here. Models and hypothesis toward the end of the list are more heavily debated and thus typically have a greater wealth of knowledge surrounding their topic.&lt;ref name = "Colangelo" /&gt;

===Continuum model===

The "Glosser and Friedman (continuum) model" is based upon the concept that deep dyslexia and phonological dyslexia are opposite endpoints on a "continuum" of reading disability.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|title=Recovery from Deep Alexia to Phonological Alexia: Points on a Continuum|journal=Brain and Language|year=1996|volume=52|issue=1|pages=114–128|doi=10.1006/brln.1996.0006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexia appears to be a more severe form of phonological dyslexia;&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt; however, symptoms in patients can change over time so that an initial diagnosis of deep dyslexia is later better described as strictly a phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; These observations suggest recovery is possible along the [[semantic pathway]].&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;

Friedman justifies the continuum hypothesis with two sets of evidence. The first involves five patients who started with deep dyslexia, but whose disorders shifted to phonological dyslexia during recovery.  Semantic paralexias were the first symptom to diminish, either partially or totally, in each case and then other symptoms were resolved to varying degrees after that. However, nonword reading was always the last symptom to go and complete recovery was never reached by any patient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crisp|first=J.|last2=Ralph|first2=M.A.|date=|year=2006|others=|title=Unlocking the Nature of the Phonological-Deep Dyslexia Continuum: The Keys to Reading Aloud Are in Phonology and Semantics|url=|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=18|issue=3|pages=348–362|doi=10.1162/089892906775990543|pmid=16513001|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second set of evidence in support of the continuum was found in her review of eleven patients with deep or phonological dyslexia in whom she found a predictable succession of symptoms.  She placed great emphasis on the order in which reading symptoms emerged (poor nonword reading first, then visual errors, then noun &gt; functor, then noun &gt; verb, concrete &gt; abstract, and finally, semantic errors) and suggested that the continuum hypothesis was supported by this pattern of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Connectionist model===

[[File:Connectionist model of deep dyslexia.png|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexics have sufficient activation of a written word's features; but, this activation decays quickly, leading to errors in speech output.]]
The "connectionist model" suggests that the phonological and semantic features of a word are [[Spreading activation|activated]], but this activation decays at a rate too quick for cognitive processing- thus, errors in speech output are produced as a result of this fading activation.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; This hypothesis explains the broad symptom-complex of deep dyslexics without resorting to a multiple loci damage approach as seen in other models.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; It eliminates the need to attribute a specific locus of damage to each symptom of deep dylsexia, and instead states that all symptoms are due to decay of a large activation area.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt;

=== Distributed attractor networks ===
Plaut and Shallice have hypothesized that units in the brain interact in such a way that semantic features form stable attractors in the space of all possible representations of words.  These unit interactions correspond to particular attractor patterns, and if the particular attractor pattern is activated, the network remains in that pattern.  However, they hypothesize that when the pattern is distorted, there is a pull on the pattern, and it gravitates toward the correct pattern, almost as if this semantic space is filled with basins, where if one point on the pattern falls to the edge of the basin, it will still gravitate toward the middle.  If you lesion this area, the neurons die and the basins change their shape.  When this happens, you may now have the same distorted starting pattern that will end up in a neighboring basin, which is a semantically related area, but not the correct one, and this would account for deep dyslexic patients to incorrectly identify "river" as "ocean".  Lesions that occur early in the network change the basins that send different semantic words to different areas of the network, whereas if they occur later, the words will be much closer semantically.  This may account for severity of the deficit in individual patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaut|first=D.C.|date=|year=1995|title=Double Dissociation Without Modularity: Evidence from Connectionist Neuropsychology|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=291–321|doi=10.1080/01688639508405124|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of inhibition hypothesis===

The "failure of inhibition hypothesis" states that the presentation of a target word activates [[semantic memory]] of that word, along with memory for other words that are semantically related.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For example, the target word "dog" may activate "bark", "cat", "squirrel", "ball", "fetch". Deep dyslexic patients are unable to inhibit the other related words, so they are likely to substitute one of these words for the target word in speech production (explicit output).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This hypothesis contradicts the belief of other researchers that the deficits seen in deep dyslexics are due to [[Mental process|processing]] problems.

Researchers believe that "failure of inhibition" has no effect on [[Implicit learning|implicit]] processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process.  Implicit knowledge involves [[phonological awareness]], understanding of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and a semantic understanding of written words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of "failure of inhibition" show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a [[lexical decision task]] with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and [[phonics]] to process the words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from [[Expressive aphasia]].&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt;

Riley and Thompson expanded on this theory in 2010.  Previous studies had shown that typical in patients with deep dyslexia, typical members of a semantic category (like "robin" in the category of "birds") are processed faster than atypical members of the same category (like "ostrich"), known as the semantic typicality effect.  According to their research, this typicality effect may indicate an inability to efficiently select a correct lexical-semantic representation.  They suggest that selection inhibition becomes impaired beginning at the level of semantics rather than the later levels of production like the original failure of inhibition hypothesis suggests.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

===Dual route model===

[[File:Dual route model and deep dyslexia diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexia can affect both pathways in the dual-route hypothesis of reading.]]
{{main article|Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud}}
The "Morton and Patterson (dual route) model" is based upon the [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual route hypothesis of reading]]. It proposes that the occurrence of semantic errors alongside an inability to read non-words aloud must be due to multiple loci of damage within this dual-route model.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Because a deep dyslexic cannot read aloud non-words, a disruption in the [[Phonology|phonological]] process is assumed, forcing reading to proceed through the semantic route.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; However, deep dyslexics also produce semantic errors while reading, alluding to damage in this pathway as well.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Other researchers refer to the phonological and semantic route as "modules".&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; They believe that patients have a partially functioning [[Lexicon|lexical]] module and a completely deficient nonlexical module.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The lexical module is analogous to the semantic route in the dual route model and relies on lexical memory, or the memory for words, to name words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; In using the lexical module, an individual accesses a "mental dictionary" of words. The nonlexical module is comparable to the phonological route and uses knowledge of spelling and [[grapheme]]s to create [[phoneme]]s to name words and nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The absent nonlexical module in deep dyslexics explains why patients cannot name nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;

===Right and left hemisphere hypotheses===
[[File:HearReadBrain.png|thumb|Activation areas in the left hemisphere when hearing or reading a word. The "left-hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system.]]

Normal reading is typically a function of a left [[Lateralization of brain function|hemisphere-based system]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; The right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] plays a minimal role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; One hypothesis, the "left hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|title=Deep Dyslexia Is Right-Hemisphere Reading|journal=Brain and Language|year=2000|volume=71|issue=2|pages=299–309|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmelin|first=R|author2=Helenius, P |author3=Service, E |title=Neurophysiology of fluent and impaired reading: a magnetoencephalographic approach.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–74|pmid=10831107|doi=10.1097/00004691-200003000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexics may be attempting to use this damaged left hemisphere, resulting in severe reading deficits.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warrington|first=Rosaleen A. McCarthy, Elizabeth K.|title=Cognitive neuropsychology : a clinical introduction|year=1990|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0124818463|edition=[7. Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the "right hemisphere hypothesis" states that deep dyslexics attempt to read using a completely different reading system.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; According to this hypothesis, they are using the right hemisphere for [[Orthography|orthographic]] and semantic processing, but given that this system does not usually play a role in reading, deep dyslexics have many reading disabilities.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; Strong support for this hypothesis comes from studies of [[split-brain]] patients who use the right hemisphere for reading. These patients makes semantic errors similar to those seen with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page= 112|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have shown that the right hemisphere ''can'' contribute to reading when a patient's left hemisphere is damaged.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; Brain imaging studies, performed both on deep dyslexics and in other patients with left hemisphere injury, have shown that the damaged left hemisphere is still playing a role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; However, the imaging has also shown that areas of the right hemisphere are also active during reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; Thus, it currently appears that there is greater support in favor of the right-hemisphere hypothesis.&lt;ref name = "Coltheart" /&gt;

==Treatment==
There have been many different studies done in an attempt to treat deep dyslexics, all which have been met with varying success. One method that has been frequently used is to teach patients to sound out words using grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence rules (for example, using single letter graphemes such as the letter 'B" to link with larger words such as "Baby", allowing for association of phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|author2=Lott, Susan Nitzberg|title=Successful blending in a phonological reading treatment for deep alexia|journal=Aphasiology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1080/02687040143000627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods are known as "non-lexically based reading treatments". Other studies have looked at attempting to repair the semantic-lexical route, known as "lexically based treatment".&lt;ref name= "Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadie|first=Nicole|author2=Rilling, Eva|title=Evaluation of lexically and nonlexically based reading treatment in a deep dyslexic|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=643–672|doi=10.1080/02643290500538364}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the methodology, treatment studies with deep dyslexics are difficult because much of the information regarding this disability is still heavily debated.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Treatment options may be successful on repairing one route of reading but not another, and success for one patient may not translate to success in another.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10443">In [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, the process of '''Design Closure''' is a part of the development workflow by which an [[integrated circuit]] design is modified from its initial description to meet a growing list of design constraints and objectives.

Every step in the IC design (such as [[static timing analysis]], [[Placement (EDA)|placement]], [[Routing (EDA)|routing]], and so on) is already complex and often forms its own field of study.  This article, however, looks at the overall design closure process, which takes a chip from its initial design state to the final form in which all of its design constraints are met.

== Introduction ==
Every chip starts off as someone’s idea of a good thing: "If we can make a part that performs function X, we will all be rich!" Once the concept is established, someone from marketing says "To make this chip profitably, it must cost $C and run at frequency F." Someone from manufacturing says "To meet this chip’s targets, it must have a yield of Y%." Someone from packaging says “It must fit in the P package and dissipate no more than W watts.” Eventually, the team generates an extensive list of all the constraints and objectives they must meet to manufacture a product that can be sold profitably. The management then forms a design team, which consists of chip architects, logic designers, functional verification engineers, physical designers, and timing engineers, and assigns them to create a chip to the specifications.

=== Constraints vs Objectives ===
The distinction between constraints and objectives is straightforward: a constraint is a design target that must be met for the design to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chip may be required to run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an objective is a design target where more
(or less) is better. For example, yield is generally an objective, which is maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the distinction between constraints and objectives is not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.

== Evolution of the Design Closure Flow ==
Designing a chip used to be a much simpler task. In the early days of VLSI, a chip consisted of a few thousand logic circuits that performed a simple function at speeds of a few MHz. Design closure was simple: if all of the necessary circuits and wires "fit", the chip would perform the desired function.

Modern design closure has grown orders of magnitude more complex. Modern logic chips can have tens to hundreds of millions of logic elements switching at speeds of several
GHz. This improvement has been driven by [[Moore’s law]] of scaling of technology, and has introduced many new design considerations. As a result, a modern VLSI designer must consider the performance of a chip against a list of dozens of design constraints and objectives including performance, power, [[signal integrity]], reliability, and yield.  In response to this growing list of constraints, the design closure flow has evolved from a simple linear list of tasks to a very complex, highly iterative flow such as the following simplified ASIC design flow:

== Reference ASIC Design Flow ==
*Concept phase: Functional objectives and architecture of a chip are developed.
*Logic design: Architecture is implemented in a register transfer level (RTL) language, then simulated to verify that it performs the desired functions. This includes [[functional verification]].
*Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
*[[Logic synthesis]]:  The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
*[[Design for Testability]]: The test structures like scan chains are inserted.

== Evolution of design constraints ==
The purpose of the flow is to take a design from concept phase to working chip. The complexity of the flow is a direct result of the addition and evolution of the list of design closure constraints. To understand this evolution it is important to understand the life cycle of a design constraint. In general, design constraints influence the design flow via the following five-stage evolution:
*Early warnings: Before chip issues begin occurring, academics and industry visionaries make dire predictions about the future impact of some new technology effect.
*Hardware problems: Sporadic hardware failures start showing up in the field due to the new effect. Postmanufacturing redesign and hardware re-spins are required to get the chip to function.
*Trial and error: Constraints on the effect are formulated and used to drive postdesign checking. Violations of the constraint are fixed manually.
*Find and repair: Large number of violations of the constraint drives the creation of automatic postdesign analysis and repair flows.
*Predict and prevent: Constraint checking moves earlier in the flow using predictive estimations of the effect. These drive optimizations to prevent violations of the constraint.

A good example of this evolution can be found in the [[signal integrity]] constraint. In the mid-1990s (180&amp;nbsp;nm
node), industry visionaries were describing the impending dangers of coupling noise long before chips were
failing. By the mid-late 1990s, noise problems were cropping up in advanced microprocessor designs.
By 2000, automated noise analysis tools were available and were used to guide manual fix-up. The total
number of noise problems identified by the analysis tools identified by the flow quickly became too many
to correct manually. In response, CAD companies developed the noise avoidance flows that are currently in
use in the industry.

At any point in time, the constraints in the design flow are at different stages of their life cycle. At the
time of this writing, for example, performance optimization is the most mature and is well into the fifth
phase with the widespread use of timing-driven design flows. Power- and defect-oriented yield optimization
is well into the fourth phase; power supply integrity, a type of noise constraint, is in the third phase;
circuit-limited yield optimization is in the second phase, etc. A list of the first-phase impending constraint
crises can always be found in the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS) 15-year-outlook technology roadmaps.

As a constraint matures in the design flow, it tends to work its way from the end of the flow to the beginning.
As it does this, it also tends to increase in complexity and in the degree that it contends with other constraints.
Constraints tend to move up in the flow due to one of the basic paradoxes of design: accuracy vs.
influence. Specifically, the earlier in a design flow a constraint is addressed, the more flexibility there is to
address the constraint. Ironically, the earlier one is in a design flow, the more difficult it is to predict compliance.
For example, an architectural decision to pipeline a logic function can have a far greater impact on
total chip performance than any amount of postrouting fix-up. At the same time, accurately predicting the
performance impact of such a change before the chip logic is synthesized, let alone placed or routed, is very
difficult. This paradox has shaped the evolution of the design closure flow in several ways. First, it requires
that the design flow is no longer composed of a linear set of discrete steps. In the early stages of VLSI it was
sufficient to break the design into discrete stages, i.e., first do logic synthesis, then do placement, then do
routing. As the number and complexity of design closure constraints has increased, the linear design flow
has broken down. In the past if there were too many timing constraint violations left after routing, it was
necessary to loop back, modify the tool settings slightly, and reexecute the previous placement steps. If the
constraints were still not met, it was necessary to reach further back in the flow and modify the chip logic
and repeat the synthesis and placement steps. This type of looping is both time consuming and unable to
guarantee convergence i.e., it is possible to loop back in the flow to correct one constraint violation only to
find that the correction induced another unrelated violation.

'''Distancing language''' is [[phrase|phrasing]] used by a person to "distance" themselves from a statement, either to avoid thinking about the subject or to distance themselves from its content. [[Euphemistic]] in nature, distancing language is often a means of [[self-deception]], but distancing language used orally may indicate that a person is [[lie|lying]]. This is especially apparent when someone is attempting to avoid consequences that they believe may arise from their statements or while trying to justify the unpleasant content of their statements by trivializing it.

[[Circumlocution]], [[synecdoches]], [[metaphors]], [[Trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]], [[innuendos]], [[litotes]], [[Meiosis (figure of speech)|meiosis]], [[Elegant variation|elegant variation]], [[equivocation]], etc. are all readily used to this end.

==Examples of distancing language==

* Distancing clinical language partly shields health workers from the impact of workplace experiences, e.g. "bled to death" substituted with "[[exsanguination|exsanguinated]]".
* [[Military personnel]] may use a range of distancing terms for [[combatants]] either killing or getting killed. They may also employ distancing, dehumanizing terms for enemy combatants. "[[Collateral damage]]" for the incidental or accidental killing of [[non-combatants]] during attacks on [[legitimate military target]]s is an example. Also "blue-on-blue" or [[friendly fire|"friendly" fire]].
* Everyday [[euphemism|euphemistic]] references to death, dying, burial, corpses and to the people and places which deal with death are also protective, distancing terms either formal or informal, respectful or disrespectful, e.g. "croaked", "bought the farm", "expired", "passed on".
* An indirect statement implying an answer, rather than a direct answer, may indicate lying. For example, replies such as "would I do such a thing?" or even "I wouldn't do such a thing", rather than "I didn't do it". Referring to someone known well by the speaker as "that woman" instead of using a name or "her" is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/16/MN241376.DTL&amp;type=science|title = The lie detective / S.F psychologist has made a science of reading facial expressions - SFGate|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other examples of distance language exist, perhaps to the point where no list could be exhaustive.

'''Dominican University of California''' is a [[private university|private]], [[not-for-profit]], coeducational [[university]] located in [[San Rafael, California]]. It was founded in 1890 as '''Dominican College''' by the [[Dominican Sisters of San Rafael]]. It is one of the oldest universities in California. 

==History==

=== Early history ===
The history of Dominican University of California can be traced back to 1850. It was in this year that [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]] was appointed Bishop of Monterey. At the time of this appointment, he was in Italy attending a meeting of the [[Dominican Order]], a Roman Catholic religious order founded by [[Saint Dominic|Saint Dominic de Guzmán]] in France in 1216.

[[File:Joseph Sadoc Alemany.JPG|thumbnail|120px|Bishop Joseph Alemany]]

As Bishop Alemany was returning to his new post in California, he stopped in Paris at the Dominican Monastery of the Cross and expressed his desire to have a few Dominican Sisters join him to teach the children of the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-niners]]. A Belgian [[novice]], Sister Mary of the Cross Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name. In 1854, the Dominicans moved to Benicia.

Following the leadership of Mother Mary Goemaere, Mother Louis O'Donnell (1887-1929) moved the [[motherhouse]], a school and [[novitiate]] from Benicia to San Rafael in 1889.

In 1890 the Congregation of the Most Holy Name, under the auspices of Mother O'Donnell, filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of California. With the encouragement of faculty of the [[University of California in Berkeley]], a junior college was opened in 1915, and in 1917 a four-year college, Dominican College, was formed. At that point Dominican College became the first Catholic college in California to grant the bachelor's degree to women.  Originally a female-only institution, Dominican College became coeducational in 1971.

==Basic information==
[[File:Dominican University of California sign.jpg|thumb]]
The campus is located in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], [[California]], 12 miles north of [[San Francisco]]. 

Class size averages 16. Dominican is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC). Four classifications of undergraduate degrees are offered: BA, BFA, BS, and BSN.

In 2017-2018, total enrollment was 1,812 undergraduate and graduate students. Students from 27 states and 19 nations are represented in the student body with 3% from other nations. 91% of students are from California. 88% of freshmen and 33% of all undergraduates reside on campus. For the 2017-18 academic year, undergraduate tuition is $44,240. In 2016-2017, 92% of undergraduates received financial aid. 

The school is a member of [[NCAA Division II]],  and competes in the [[Pacific West Conference]].

==Campus==
Dominican occupies approximately {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in central [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] in the City of [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]]. It is situated in a residential neighborhood at the base of [http://www.marincountyparks.org/depts/pk/divisions/open-space/san-pedro-mountain San Pedro Mountain]. The gardens of the University are a combination of four former family estates and contain over 100 species of trees. A seasonal creek flows east to west through the middle of campus.

===Residence halls===
Almost 90% of freshmen live on-campus. Freshmen are automatically guaranteed a residency on campus while sophomores, juniors and seniors receive on-campus housing through a lottery. All residence halls are co-ed with gender specific bathrooms. Each hall has a [[Resident assistant|"resident advisor"]] who oversees the students. 

===Points of interest===

====Ansel Adams Collection====
In the 1980s, an alumna remembered that she had her picture taken when she was a student at the college in the 1950s. She went in search of the print. While she didn't find her photograph, nearly 100 original [[Ansel Adams]] photographs were discovered scattered across campus. These photographs, taken by the not-yet-famous Adams between 1932 and 1952, are part of the Dominican private collection.

====Della Robia Collection====
Enameled [[Terracotta|terra-cotta]] sculptures grace the entryways to Meadowlands Hall, Guzman Hall, Archbishop Alemany Library and Caleruega Hall. These terra-cotta sculptures have been made for centuries by the Della Robia family, a famous Florentine family of sculptors and ceramicists which started with [[Luca della Robbia]].

====Forest Meadows Amphitheater====
[[File:Forest Meadows Amphitheater.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Forest Meadows Amphitheater]]
Forest Meadows Amphitheater is an amphitheater on Dominican's Campus. While it used to hold the University's Commencement ceremonies, the amphitheater is now used by the [[Marin Shakespeare Company]] during the Shakespeare Festival in the fall. The company has been using the amphitheater since 1967.

===Off-campus sites===

====Ukiah Center====
In addition to the San Rafael main campus, Dominican also has a satellite campus in Ukiah, California, in [[Mendocino County, California]].  Established in 1984, the Ukiah Center, located in the Mendocino County Office of Education, offers Teacher Credential Programs and MS in Education Programs.

==Academics==
Dominican focuses on interdisciplinary studies. In the sciences, the University involves undergraduates in sophisticated research projects, and encourages students to present at national academic conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals. In the humanities, students can combine dance and musical performance with the study of philosophy, literature, world cultures, and religion. Dominican also offers undergraduate and graduate programs in business, education, counseling psychology, occupational therapy and nursing. It follows a semester system: Fall (August–December) and Spring (January–May). Classes are also offered in the summer.

===Schools/departments===
The University is organized into four schools with the following departments:

School of Liberal Arts and Education
* Art, Art History and Design
* Communications and Media Studies
* Counseling Psychology
* Education
* History
* Humanities and Cultural Studies
* Literature and Languages
* Music, Dance and Performing Arts
* Political Science and International Studies
* Psychology
* Religion and Philosophy
* Women and Gender Studies

Barowsky School of Business
* Business

School of Health and Natural Sciences
* Natural Sciences and Mathematics

* Athletics: [[NCAA Division II]]

==Organization and administration==
Dominican is a non-profit organization, governed by a privately appointed Board of Trustees, along with the University President, Provost, Vice-Presidents and Deans. The Board currently has 30 voting members who serve three 3-year terms and meet four times annually. The Trustees elect a President to serve as the general manager and chief executive of the university. Mary B. Marcy was appointed the 9th President of the University in July 2011.

===Student government===
The Associated Students of Dominican University (ASDU) is the student government for Dominican and helps students plan and provide campus activities, distribute activity funds, initiate changes in policy, and represent themselves to the University’s administration and the broader community. This group of elected student representatives serves both as the student activities association and the student government board. The members of the ASDU Senate are composed of representatives from all four class levels of regular day program students.

==Student life==
===Athletics===
{{main|Dominican Penguins}}

The Dominican Penguins are the athletics teams for Dominican University of California. Since 2005, the Penguins have competed in the [[NCAA Division II]], [[Pacific West Conference]]. The university currently fields 11 teams: Men's [[Basketball]], [[Cross country running|Cross Country]], [[Golf]], and [[Soccer]]; Women's [[Basketball]], [[Cross country running|Cross Country]], [[Golf]], [[Soccer]], [[Softball]], [[Tennis]], and [[Volleyball]]. Dominican also supports Men's [[Lacrosse]], which competes in [[Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association|MCLA]] Division I.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominican.edu/campus-life/athletics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===

====Shield Ceremony====
[[File:Shield Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Shield Ceremony at Dominican University of California]]

Each fall, the university holds a Shield Ceremony, a tradition that started in the 12th century when Saint Dominic Guzman created the Dominican order. It now continues every fall during Convocation, when the Dominican seniors officially greet the incoming freshmen with a special gift: an illustration of a shield that reflects an inspirational motto. The motto, written by the seniors, is intended to help guide the freshmen throughout their college years and beyond. Four years later at Commencement, a hand-crafted wood carving of the illustrated shield is presented to the graduating class. All of Dominican's shields, dating back to the early 1920s, are displayed on campus in the Meadowlands Residence Hall, Guzman Lecture Hall and the Shield Room.

====Convocation/Family Weekend (formerly Spirit Week)====
Once a year, Dominican invites all students and their families for a three-day celebration of the University and its students.  It opens on Friday night with Convocation, a celebration of the academic achievements of Dominican students. Throughout the weekend, all are invited to explore the campus, attend special classes, meet with the President and faculty and cheer on the Dominican Penguins at competitive games. Family Weekend concludes on Sunday with an athletic scrimmage and tailgate party.

====Senior thesis====
Most academic departments at Dominican require a senior thesis/project, a one-year culminating experience that offers evidence of accomplishment in a discipline or area of inquiry. Like a master’s thesis, the senior thesis gives students an opportunity as undergraduates, to explore in- depth issues that interest them. The major determines the nature of the thesis/project, which can take many forms: a research document, a novel, a business plan, a portfolio of poetry, or original works of art.

====Baccalaureate Mass, Hood Ceremony, Commencement====
Held the day prior to Commencement, Baccalaureate Mass is a unique tradition that reflects Dominican's Catholic heritage. The Mass, planned and led by members of the graduating classes, is held at St. Raphael's Church in downtown San Rafael. Students and their families, faculty, staff and friends of the University are invited to attend.

On the eve of Commencement, Dominican honors the academic achievement of graduating students with The Hood Ceremony. Each graduating senior and graduate student receives a hood, which is a colorful, historic symbol of scholastic excellence. This ceremony is a time-honored tradition in which the students and faculty wear their academic regalia. Conferral of the hood symbolizes that students have joined the community of educated people.

On a Saturday morning in May, the campus community joins graduating students, their families and friends for Commencement. The Dominican tradition includes a procession led by a bagpiper.

===Clubs and organizations===
There are more than forty student clubs and organizations at Dominican with categories including Athletics, Campus Diversity, Religious, Social and Major-Related.

Electromechanics focuses on the interaction of electrical and mechanical systems as a whole and how the two systems interact with each other. This process is especially prominent in systems such as those of DC Machines which can be designed and operated to generate power from a mechanical process ([[Electric generator|generator]]) or used to power a mechanical effect ([[motor]]). Electrical engineering in this context also encompasses [[electronic engineering|electronics engineering]].

Electromechanical devices are ones which have both electrical and mechanical processes. Strictly speaking, a manually operated switch is an electromechanical component due to the mechanical movement causing an electrical output. Though this is true, the term is usually understood to refer to devices which involve an electrical signal to create mechanical movement, or vice versa mechanical movement to create an electric signal. Often involving electromagnetic principles such as in [[relay]]s, which allow a [[voltage]] or current to control another, usually isolated circuit voltage or current by mechanically switching sets of contacts, and [[solenoid]]s, by which a voltage can actuate a moving linkage as in solenoid valves.

Before the development of modern electronics, electromechanical devices were widely used in complicated subsystems of parts, including [[electric typewriter]]s, [[teleprinter]]s, [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|clocks]], initial [[television]] systems, and the very early electromechanical [[digital computer]]s.

== History ==
The first electric motor was invented in 1821 by [[Michael Faraday]]. The motor was developed only a year after [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered that the flow of electric current creates a proportional magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faradays-motor|title=Michael Faraday's electric magnetic rotation apparatus (motor)|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early motor was simply a wire partially submerged into a glass of mercury with a magnet at the bottom. When the wire was connected to a battery a magnetic field was created and this interaction with the magnetic field given off by the magnet caused the wire to spin.

Ten years later the first electric generator was invented, again by Michael Faraday. This generator consisted of a magnet passing through a coil of wire and inducing current that was measured by a galvanometer. Faraday's research and experiments into electricity are the basis of most of modern electromechanical principles known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-generator|title=Michael Faraday's generator|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in electromechanics surged with the research into long distance communication.The [[Industrial Revolution]]'s rapid increase in production gave rise to a demand for intracontinental communication, allowing electromechanics to make its way into public service. [[Relay]]s originated with [[telegraphy]] as electromechanical devices were used to [[Signal regeneration|regenerate]] telegraph signals. The [[Strowger switch]], the [[Panel switch]], and similar devices were widely used in early automated [[telephone exchange]]s. [[Crossbar switch]]es were first widely installed in the middle 20th century in [[Sweden]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Great Britain]], and these quickly spread to the rest of the world.

Electromechanical systems saw a massive leap in progress from 1910-1945 as the world was put into global war twice. [[World War I]] saw a burst of new electromechanics as spotlights and radios were used by all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/wwi-technology-and-weapons-war|title=WWI: Technology and the weapons of war {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[World War II]], countries had developed and centralized their military around the versatility and power of electromechanics. One example of these still used today is the [[alternator]], which was created to power military equipment in the 1950s and later repurposed for automobiles in the 1960s. Post-war America greatly benefited from the military's development of electromechanics as household work was quickly be replaced by electromechanical systems such as microwaves, refrigerators, and washing machines. The [[electromechanical television]] systems of the late 19th century were less successful.

[[Typewriter|Electric typewriter]]s developed, up to the 1980s, as "power-assisted typewriters". They contained a single electrical component, the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar. This was also true of the later IBM [[Selectric]]. At [[Bell Labs]], in the 1946, the Bell [[Model V]] computer was developed. It was an electromechanical relay-based device; cycles took seconds. In 1968 electromechanical systems were still under serious consideration for an aircraft flight control computer, until a device based on [[large scale integration]] electronics was adopted in the [[Central Air Data Computer]].

== Modern practice ==
Today, electromechanical processes are mainly used by power companies. All fuel based generators convert mechanical movement to electrical power. Some renewable energies such as [[Wind power|wind]] and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] are powered by mechanical systems that also convert movement to electricity.

In the last thirty years of the 20th century, equipment which would generally have used electromechanical devices became less expensive. This equipment became cheaper because it used more reliably integrated [[microcontroller]] circuits containing ultimately a few million transistors, and a [[computer program|program]] to carry out the same task through logic. With electromechanical components there were only moving parts, such as mechanical [[electric actuator]]s. This more reliable logic has replaced most electromechanical devices, because any point in a system which must rely on mechanical movement for proper operation will inevitably have mechanical wear and eventually fail. Properly designed electronic circuits without moving parts will continue to operate correctly almost indefinitely and are used in most simple feedback control systems. Circuits without moving parts appear in a large number of items from [[traffic light]]s to [[washing machine]]s.

Another electromechanical device is [[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric devices]], but they do not use electromagnetic principles. Piezoelectric devices can create sound or vibration from an electrical signal or create an electrical signal from sound or mechanical vibration.

To become an electromechanical engineer, typical college courses involve mathematics, engineering, computer science, designing of machines, and other automotive classes that help gain skill in troubleshooting and analyzing issues with machines. To be an electromechanical engineer a bachelor's degree is required, usually in electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical engineering. As of April 2018, only two universities, [[Michigan Tech|Michigan Technological University]] and [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], offer the major of electromechanical engineering. To enter the electromechanical field as an entry level technician, an associative degree is all that is required.

As of 2016, approximately 13,800 people work as electro-mechanical technicians in the US. The job outlook for 2016 to 2026 for technicians is 4% growth which is about an employment change of 500 positions. This outlook is slower than average.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, Electro-mechanical Technicians, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electro-mechanical-technicians.htm (visited April 13, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[computational chemistry]], '''energy minimization''' (also called '''energy optimization''', '''geometry minimization''', or '''geometry optimization''') is the process of finding an arrangement in space of a collection of atoms where, according to some computational model of chemical bonding, the net inter-atomic force on each atom is acceptably close to zero and the position on the [[potential energy surface]] (PES) is a stationary point (described later). The collection of atoms might be a single [[molecule]], an [[ion]], a [[condensed phase]], a [[transition state]] or even a collection of any of these. The computational model of chemical bonding might, for example, be quantum mechanics.

As an example, when optimizing the geometry of a [[Water (molecule)|water molecule]], one aims to obtain the hydrogen-oxygen bond lengths and the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen bond angle which minimize the forces that would otherwise be pulling atoms together or pushing them apart.

The motivation for performing a geometry optimization is the physical significance of the obtained structure: optimized structures often correspond to a substance as it is found in nature and the geometry of such a structure can be used in a variety of experimental and theoretical investigations in the fields of [[chemical structure]], [[thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[spectroscopy]] and others.

Typically, but not always, the process seeks to find the geometry of a particular arrangement of the atoms that represents a local or global energy minimum. Instead of searching for global energy minimum, it might be desirable to optimize to a [[transition state]], that is, a saddle point on the potential energy surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/MOTION/GEO_OPT.html#desc_TYPE|title=Input reference of CP2K version trunk, Section GEO_OPT, Keyword TYPE|publisher=CP2K|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, certain coordinates (such as a chemical bond length) might be fixed during the optimization.

== Molecular geometry and mathematical interpretation ==

The geometry of a set of atoms can be described by a vector of the atoms' positions. This could be the set of the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms or, when considering molecules, might be so called ''internal coordinates'' formed from a set of bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles.

Given a set of atoms and a vector, {{math| '''r'''}}, describing the atoms' positions, one can introduce the concept of the energy as a function of the positions, {{math| ''E''('''r''')}}. Geometry optimization is then a [[mathematical optimization]] problem, in which it is desired to find the value of {{math| '''r'''}} for which {{math| ''E''('''r''')}} is at a [[local minimum]], that is, the derivative of the energy with respect to the position of the atoms, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}}, is the zero vector and the second derivative matrix of the system, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also known as the [[Hessian matrix]], which describes the curvature of the PES at {{math| '''r'''}}, has all positive [[eigenvalues]] (is [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]).

A special case of a geometry optimization is a search for the geometry of a [[transition state]]; this is discussed below.

The computational model that provides an approximate {{math| ''E''('''r''')}} could be based on [[Quantum chemistry|quantum mechanics]] (using either [[density functional theory]] or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical methods]]), [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], or a combination of those in case of [[QM/MM]]. Using this computational model and an initial guess (or [[ansatz]]) of the correct geometry, an iterative optimization procedure is followed, for example:

# calculate the force on each atom (that is, {{math| -&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}})
# if the force is less than some threshold, '''finish'''
# otherwise, move the atoms by some computed step {{math|∆'''r'''}} that is predicted to reduce the force
# '''repeat '''from the start

== Practical aspects of optimization ==

As described above, some method such as quantum mechanics can be used to calculate the energy, {{math| ''E''('''r''') }}, the gradient of the PES, that is, the derivative of the energy with respect to the position of the atoms, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}} and the second derivative matrix of the system, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also known as the [[Hessian matrix]], which describes the curvature of the PES at {{math| '''r'''}}.

An [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithm can use some or all of {{math| ''E''('''r''') }}, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}} and {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} to try to minimize the forces and this could in theory be any method such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient or Newton's method, but in practice, algorithms which use knowledge of the PES curvature, that is the Hessian matrix, are found to be superior. For most systems of practical interest, however, it may be prohibitively expensive to compute the second derivative matrix, and it is estimated from successive values of the gradient, as is typical in a [[Quasi-Newton method|Quasi-Newton]] optimization.

The choice of the coordinate system can be crucial for performing a successful optimization. Cartesian coordinates, for example, are redundant since a non-linear molecule with {{math| ''N''}} atoms has {{math|3''N''–6}} vibrational [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] whereas the set of Cartesian coordinates has {{math|3''N''}} dimensions. Additionally, Cartesian coordinates are highly correlated, that is, the Hessian matrix has many non-diagonal terms that are not close to zero. This can lead to numerical problems in the optimization, because, for example, it is difficult to obtain a good approximation to the Hessian matrix and calculating it precisely is too computationally expensive. However, in case that energy is expressed with standard force fields, computationally efficient methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatzieleftheriou |first=S. |last2=Adendorff |first2=M. R. |last3=Lagaros |first3=N. D.  |year=2016 |title=Generalized Potential Energy Finite Elements for Modeling Molecular Nanostructures|journal=J. Chem. Inf. Model. |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=1963–1978 |doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00356}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to derive analytically the Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinates while preserving a computational complexity of the same order to that of gradient computations. Internal coordinates tend to be less correlated but are more difficult to set-up and it can be difficult to describe some systems, such as ones with symmetry or large condensed phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peng|first=C. |last2=Ayala |first2=P.

=== Degree of freedom restriction ===

Some degrees of freedom can be eliminated from an optimization, for example, positions of atoms or bond lengths and angles can be given fixed values. Sometimes these are referred to as being ''frozen'' degrees of freedom.

Figure 1 depicts a geometry optimization of the atoms in a carbon nanotube in the presence of an external electrostatic field. In this optimization, the atoms on the left have their positions frozen. Their interaction with the other atoms in the system are still calculated, but alteration the atoms' position during the optimization is prevented.

]]

== Transition state optimization ==

[[Transition state]] structures can be determined by searching for [[saddle points]] on the PES of the chemical species of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Computational Chemistry|publisher= John Wiley and Sons Ltd|location= England|year=1999|author= Frank Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first-order saddle point is a position on the PES corresponding to a minimum in all directions except one; a second-order saddle point is a minimum in all directions except two, and so on. Defined mathematically, an ''n''th order saddle point is characterized by the following:  {{math|1 = &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r''' = '''0'''}} and the Hessian matrix, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has exactly ''n'' negative eigenvalues.

Algorithms to locate transition state geometries fall into two main categories: local methods and semi-global methods. Local methods are suitable when the starting point for the optimization is very close to the true transition state (''very close'' will be defined shortly) and semi-global methods find application when it is sought to locate the transition state with very little ''a priori'' knowledge of its geometry. Some methods, such as the Dimer method (see below), fall into both categories.

=== Local searches ===
A so-called local optimization requires an initial guess of the transition state that is very close to the true transition state. ''Very close'' typically means that the initial guess must have a  corresponding Hessian matrix with one negative eigenvalue, or, the negative eigenvalue corresponding to the reaction coordinate must be greater in magnitude than the other negative eigenvalues. Further, the eigenvector with the most negative eigenvalue must correspond to the reaction coordinate, that is, it must represent the geometric transformation relating to the process whose transition state is sought.

Given the above pre-requisites, a local optimization algorithm can then move "uphill" along the eigenvector with the most negative eigenvalue and "downhill" along all other degrees of freedom, using something similar to a quasi-Newton method.

=== Dimer method ===
The dimer method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A dimer method for finding saddle points on high dimensional potential surfaces using only first derivatives|journal= J. Chem. Phys. |volume=111 |year=1999| pages=7010–7022|author1=Graeme Henkelman |author2=Hannes Jónsson |doi=10.1063/1.480097|issue=15|bibcode = 1999JChPh.111.7010H }}
&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to find possible transition states without knowledge of the final structure or to refine a good guess of a transition structure. The “dimer” is formed by two images very close to each other on the PES. The method works by moving the dimer uphill from the starting position whilst rotating the dimer to find the direction of lowest curvature (ultimately negative).

=== Activation Relaxation Technique (ART) ===

The Activation Relaxation Technique (ART)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Event-Based Relaxation of Continuous Disordered Systems|journal= Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=77 |year=1996| pages=4358–4361|author1=G.T. Barkema |author2=Normand Mousseau |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.4358|issue=21|arxiv = cond-mat/9607156 |bibcode = 1996PhRvL..77.4358B |pmid=10062518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Optimized energy landscape exploration using the ab initio based activation-relaxation technique.|journal= J Chem Phys|volume=135 |year=2011| pages=7723–7728|author1=Rachid Malek |author2=Normand Mousseau |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.62.7723|issue=6|arxiv = cond-mat/0006042 |bibcode = 2000PhRvE..62.7723M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Optimized energy landscape exploration using the ab initio based activation-relaxation technique|journal= J. Chem. Phys. |volume=62 |year=2011| pages=034102–034112|author1=Eduardo Machado-Charry |author2=Laurent Karim Béland |author3=Damien Caliste |author4=Luigi Genovese |author5=Thierry Deutsch |author6=Normand Mousseau |author7=Pascal Pochet |doi=10.1063/1.3609924|issue=3|bibcode = 2011JChPh.135c4102M }}
&lt;/ref&gt; is also an open-ended method to find new transition states or to refine known saddle points on the PES. The method follows the direction of lowest negative curvature (computed using the [[Lanczos algorithm]]) on the PES to reach the saddle point, relaxing in the perpendicular hyperplane between each "jump" (activation) in this direction.

=== Chain-of-state methods ===
Chain-of-state&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, F. Introduction to Computational Chemistry; Wiley: 2 ed.; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; methods can be used to find the ''approximate'' geometry of the transition state based on the geometries of the reactant and product. The generated approximate geometry can then serve as a starting point for refinement via a local search, which was described above.

Chain-of-state methods use a series of vectors, that is points on the PES, connecting the reactant and product of the reaction of interest, {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;reactant&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;product&lt;/sub&gt;}}, thus discretizing the reaction pathway. Very commonly, these points are referred to as ''beads ''due to an analogy of a set of beads connected by strings or springs, which connect the reactant and products. The series of beads is often initially created by interpolating between {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;reactant&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;product&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for example, for a series of {{math|''N'' + 1}} beads, bead {{math|''i''}} might be given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i = \frac{i}{N}\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{product} + \left(1 - \frac{i}{N} \right)\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{reactant}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''i'' &amp;isin; 0, 1, ..., ''N''}}. Each of the beads {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has an energy, {{math| ''E''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and forces, {{math|-&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and these are treated with a constrained optimization process that seeks to get an as accurate as possible representation of the reaction pathway. For this to be achieved, spacing constraints must be applied so that each bead {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not simply get optimized to the reactant and product geometry.

Often this constraint is achieved by [[Vector projection|projecting]] out components of the force on each bead {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or alternatively the movement of each bead during optimization, that are tangential to the reaction path. For example, if for convenience, it is defined that {{math|1 = '''g'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the energy gradient at each bead minus the component of the energy gradient that is tangential to the reaction pathway is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_i^\perp = \mathbf{g}_i - \mathbf{\tau}_i(\mathbf{\tau}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_i) = \left( I - \mathbf{\tau}_i \mathbf{\tau}_i^T \right)\mathbf{g}_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''}} is the identity matrix and {{math|'''τ'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a unit vector representing the reaction path tangent at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By projecting out components of the energy gradient  or the optimization step that are parallel to the reaction path, an optimization algorithm significantly reduces the tendency of each of the beads to be optimized directly to a minimum.

==== Synchronous transit ====
The simplest chain-of-state method is the linear synchronous transit (LST) method. It operates by taking interpolated points between the reactant and product geometries and choosing the one with the highest energy for subsequent refinement via a local search. The quadratic synchronous transit (QST) method extends LST by allowing a parabolic reaction path, with optimization of the highest energy point orthogonally to the parabola.

Specifically, the force {{math|'''f'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on each point ''i'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}_i = \mathbf{f}_i^{\parallel} -\mathbf{g}_i^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}_i^{\parallel} = k\left[\left( \left(\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \mathbf{r}_i\right) - \left(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{i-1}\right)\right)\cdot\tau_i \right] \tau_i&lt;/math&gt;

is the spring force parallel to the pathway at each point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (''k'' is a spring constant and {{math|τ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as before, is a unit vector representing the reaction path tangent at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}).

In a traditional implementation, the point with the highest energy is used for subsequent refinement in a local search.There are many variations on the NEB (nudged elastic band) method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/neb/ |title=Nudged Elastic Band |work=UT Austin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203094132/http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/neb/ |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such including the climbing image NEB, in which the point with the highest energy is pushed upwards during the optimization procedure so as to (hopefully) give a geometry which is even closer to that of the transition state.

In each step of an optimization procedure, the points might be moved according to the force acting on them perpendicular to the path, and then, if the equidistance constraint between the points is no-longer satisfied, the points can be redistributed, using the spline representation of the path to generate new vectors with the required spacing.

Variations on the string method include the growing string method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A growing string method for determining transition states: Comparison to the nudged elastic band and string methods|journal= J. Chem. Phys.|volume= 120 |year=2004|pages=7877–7886|author1=Baron Peters |author2=Andreas Heyden |author3=Alexis T. Bell |author4=Arup Chakraborty |doi=10.1063/1.1691018|pmid=15267702|issue=17|bibcode = 2004JChPh.120.7877P }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the guess of the pathway is grown in from the end points (that is the reactant and products) as the optimization progresses.

== Comparison with other techniques ==

Geometry optimization is fundamentally different from a [[molecular dynamics]] simulation. The latter simulates the motion of molecules with respect to time, subject to temperature, chemical forces, initial velocities, [[Brownian motion]] of a solvent, and so on, via the application of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws of Motion]]. This means that the trajectories of the atoms which get computed, have some physical meaning. Geometry optimization, by contrast, does not produce a "trajectory" with any physical meaning – it is concerned with minimization of the forces acting on each atom in a collection of atoms, and the pathway via which it achieves this lacks meaning. Different optimization algorithms could give the same result for the minimum energy structure, but arrive at it via a different pathway.

'''Escapist fiction''' is [[fiction]] that provides a psychological escape from thoughts of everyday life by immersing the reader in exotic situations or activities.

The term is not used favorably, though the condemnation contained in it may be slight. Those who defend works described as escapist from the charge either assert that they are not escapist—such as that a [[science fiction]] novel's satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of "escape" as such, not "escapism"—as in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s quotation, in his "On Science Fiction" of Tolkien's question of who would be most hostile to the idea of escape, and his answer: jailers.

Genres that can include elements of escapist fiction include:
* [[Bodice ripper]]s/[[Romance novel]]s
* [[Detective novel]]s
* [[Fantasy fiction]]
* [[Horror fiction]]
* [[Pulp magazines|Pulp fiction]]
* [[Science fiction]]
* [[Spy novel]]s
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">[[File:beetle.svg|thumb|340px|[[Vector graphics]] consists of geometrical primitives]]
The term '''geometric primitive''', or '''prim''', in [[computer graphics]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD systems]] is used in various senses, with the common meaning of the simplest (i.e. 'atomic' or irreducible) geometric objects that the system can handle (draw, store). Sometimes the [[subroutine]]s that draw the corresponding objects are called "geometric primitives" as well. The most "primitive" primitives are point and straight line segment, which were all that early [[vector graphics]] systems had.

In [[constructive solid geometry]], primitives are simple [[geometry|geometric]] shapes such as a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], [[cone (geometry)|cone]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], [[torus]].

Modern [[2D computer graphics]] systems may operate with primitives which are lines (segments of straight lines, circles and more complicated curves), as well as shapes (boxes, arbitrary polygons, circles).

A common set of two-dimensional primitives includes lines, points, and [[polygon]]s, although some people prefer to consider triangles primitives, because every polygon can be constructed from triangles. All other graphic elements are built up from these primitives. In three dimensions, triangles or polygons positioned in three-dimensional space can be used as primitives to model more complex 3D forms. In some cases, curves (such as [[Bézier curve]]s, [[circle]]s, etc.) may be considered primitives; in other cases, curves are complex forms created from many straight, primitive shapes.

== Common primitives ==

[[File:Second Life torus prim.jpg|thumb|A 3D [[torus]] prim created in [[Second Life]]]]
* {{anchor|POINT}}[[Point (geometry)|point]]s
* {{anchor|LINE}}[[line (mathematics)|lines]] and [[line segment]]s
* {{anchor|PLANE}}[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]s
* {{anchor|CIRCLE}}[[circle]]s and {{anchor|ELLIPSE}}[[ellipse]]s
* {{anchor|TRIANGLE}}[[triangle]]s,  {{anchor|QUAD}}'quads' or arbitrary {{anchor|POLYGON}}[[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]s
* {{anchor|SPLINE}}[[spline (mathematics)|spline curves]]

In 3D applications, basic geometric shapes and forms are considered to be primitives rather than the above list. Such shapes and forms include:
* {{anchor|SPHERE}}[[sphere]]s
* {{anchor|CUBE}}[[cube]]s or {{anchor|CUBOID}}[[box]]es
* {{anchor|TOROID|TORUS}}[[toroid]]s
* {{anchor|CYLINDER}}[[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s
* {{anchor|PYRAMID}}[[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]s
* {{anchor|TRIANGLE MESH}}[[triangle mesh]]es or {{anchor|POLYGON MESH}}[[polygon mesh]]es are a common unit from which scenes are composed, which are in turn composed of connected vertices.

These are considered to be primitives in 3D modelling because they are the building blocks for many other shapes and forms.  A 3D package may also include a list of extended primitives which are more complex shapes that come with the package.  For example, a [[Utah teapot|teapot]] is listed as a primitive in [[3D Studio Max]].

== In 3D modelling ==

In CAD software or [[3D modelling]], the interface may present the user with the ability to create primitives which may be further modified by edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3d studio primitives|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-66152BDE-BA64-423F-8472-C1F0EB409E16-htm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in the practice of [[box modelling]] the user will start with a cuboid, then use extrusion and other operations to create the model. In this use the primitive is just a convenient starting point, rather than the fundamental unit of modelling.

== In graphics hardware ==

Various [[graphics accelerator]]s exist with [[hardware acceleration]] for rendering specific primitives such as lines or triangles, frequently with [[texture mapping]] and [[shader]]s. Modern 3D accelerators typically accept sequences of triangles as [[triangle strip]]s.

The '''H'''paII tiny fragment '''E'''nrichment by '''L'''igation-mediated [[Polymerase chain reaction|'''P'''CR]] Assay (HELP Assay)&lt;ref name="pmid16809668" /&gt; is one of several techniques used for determining whether DNA has been [[DNA_methylation#Assays_to_Detect_DNA_Methylation|methylated]]. The technique can be adapted to examine DNA methylation within and around individual [[genes]], or it can be expanded to examine methylation in an entire [[genome]].

The technique relies upon the properties of two [[restriction enzymes]]: ''Hpa''II and ''Msp''I. The HELP assay&lt;ref name=pmid16809668&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Khulan B, Thompson RF, Ye K, etal |title=Comparative isoschizomer profiling of cytosine methylation: The HELP assay |journal=Genome Research |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=1046–55 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16809668 |pmc=1524864 |doi=10.1101/gr.5273806}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares representations generated by ''Hpa''II and by ''Msp''I digestion of the genome followed by ligation-mediated PCR. ''Hpa''II only digests 5'-C'''CG'''G-3' sites when the cytosine in the central CG dinucleotide is unmethylated, the ''Hpa''II representation is enriched for the hypomethylated fraction of the genome. The ''Msp''I representation is a control for copy number changes and [[PCR]] amplification difficulties.

It was recently shown that cytosine methylation patterns tend to be concordant over short (~1 kb) regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eckhardt F, Lewin J, Cortese R, etal |title=DNA methylation profiling of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1378–85 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17072317 |doi=10.1038/ng1909 |pmc=3082778}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns represented by the ''Hpa''II sites therefore tend to be representative of other CG dinucleotides locally.

The analysis of HELP data involves quality analysis and normalization. An analytical pipeline written in the [[R programming language]] was recently published to allow HELP data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Thompson RF, Reimers M, Khulan B, etal |title=An analytical pipeline for genomic representations used for cytosine methylation studies |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=1161–7 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18353789 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn096|pmc=5061929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">[[File:Geheimer Regierungsrat Prof. Dr. Hermann Kretzschmar, 1912.png|thumb|(1912)]]

'''August Ferdinand Hermann Kretzschmar''' (19 January 1848&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1924) was a [[Germany|German]] [[musicologist]] and writer, and is considered a founder of interpretation in musical study.

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Olbernhau]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], Kretzschmar was son of the organist and cantor Karl Dankegott Kretzschmar. He was from 1862 a student in the [[Kreuzschule]] in [[Dresden]], where from 1867–1868 he was twice Prefect of the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]]. In addition, from 1870 he studied [[Philology]] at [[Leipzig University]] as well as Music at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] and was awarded his doctorate there. From 1871 he was actively teaching in Theory, Composition, Piano and Organ at the Leipzig Conservatory, and acted as director/conductor for various musical societies. In 1876 he became theatre orchestra conductor in [[Metz]], and undertook research expeditions in England and Italy for the study of musical history; from 1877 to 1887 he was an academic and state music director in [[Rostock]].

From 1887 to 1904 he renewed his position in Leipzig as active University Music Director. From 1888-1898 he was Director of the [[Riedel]] Choral Society. In the year 1890 he was awarded an honorary professorship, and in 1890 he founded the Leipzig Academic Concerts which he conducted until 1895. In 1904 he was appointed as regular Professor of Music at the [[University of Berlin]]; from 1907–1922 he was Director of the Royal Institute for Church Music, and also (from 1909–1920) as successor to [[Joseph Joachim]] he was Director of the High School for Music founded in 1869 (i.e. the Berlin Hochschule). He was a government privy counsellor. One of his students was composer and musicologist [[Walter Niemann (composer)|Walter Niemann]]. {{See LMST|Hermann|Kretzschmar}}

Kretzschmar was from 1880 married to the British pianist [[Klara Meller]].
[[File:Friedhof Nikolassee - Grab Hermann Kretzschmar.jpg|right|thumb|Gravesite of Kretzschmar at the Friedhof Nikolassee in Berlin]] 
He died in [[Berlin]]-Schlachtensee in 1924, after which he was buried in a grave of honour in the Evangelic Nicholassee churchyard in Berlin.

== Literary allusion ==
In his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] creates the character of Dr Wendell Kretschmar, the inspirational and eccentric musicologist, lecturer and teacher of the composer Adrian Leverkühn. The name is probably given in homage to his real-life contemporary Hermann Kretzschmar, whose essays in musical interpretation were widely read and appreciated around the turn of the twentieth century.

[[Candle|Candles]] were used by the early [[Greeks]] to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Candle|Candles]] were made by the Romans beginning about 500 BC. These were true dipped candles and made from [[tallow]]. Evidence for candles made from [[whale fat]] in China dates back to the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC).&lt;ref name=telesco&gt;{{cite book | last = Telesco | first = Patricia  | title = Exploring Candle Magick: Candle Spells, Charms, Rituals, and Divinations | publisher = Career Press  | year = 2001 | location =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHORLtm3KAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=wax+boiling+cinnamon+candle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=tiI6EMFlQa8qc-8HN8J7qfUXS3k | isbn = 1-56414-522-0| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], wax from boiling [[cinnamon]] was used for temple candles.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt;

In parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Africa, where lamp oil made from olives was readily available, candle making remained unknown until the early middle-ages.  Candles were primarily made from [[tallow]] and [[beeswax]] in ancient times, but have been made from [[spermaceti]], purified animal fats ([[stearin]]) and [[paraffin wax]] in recent centuries.&lt;ref name= Ullmann/&gt;

==Antiquity==
The early [[Greeks]] used candles to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; While oil lamps were the most widely used source of illumination in Roman Italy, candles were common and regularly given as gifts during [[Saturnalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/how-did-romans-celebrate-%E2%80%98christmas%E2%80%99 |title=How did the Romans celebrate ‘Christmas’? |website=History Extra |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mausoleum of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259–210 BC), contained candles made from whale fat.

There is a fish called the [[eulachon]] or "candlefish", a type of [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the 1st century AD, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] from this region used oil from this fish for illumination.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt; A simple candle could be made by putting the dried fish on a forked stick and then lighting it.

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Candles Oberflacht.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest surviving bees wax candles north of the Alps from the alamannic graveyard of Oberflacht, Germany dating to 6th/7th century A.D.]]
After the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], trading disruptions made [[olive oil]], the most common fuel for oil lamps, unavailable throughout much of Europe. As a consequence, candles became more widely used. By contrast, in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], candle-making remained relatively unknown due to the availability of olive oil.

Candles were commonplace throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. Candle makers (known as [[chandlery|chandler]]s) made candles from fats saved from the kitchen or sold their own candles from within their shops. The trade of the chandler is also recorded by the more picturesque name of "smeremongere", since they oversaw the manufacture of sauces, vinegar, soap and cheese. The popularity of candles is shown by their use in [[Candlemas]] and in [[Saint Lucy]] festivities.

[[Tallow]], fat from cows or sheep, became the standard material used in candles in Europe. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is due to the glycerine they contain. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in several European cities. [[Beeswax]] was discovered to be an excellent substance for candle production without the unpleasant odour, but remained restricted in usage for the rich and for churches and royal events, due to their great expense.

In [[England]] and [[France]], candle making had become a [[guild|guild craft]] by the 13th century. The [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers|Tallow Chandlers Company]] of [[London]] was formed in about 1300 in London, and in 1456 was granted a [[coat of arms]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers|Wax Chandlers Company]] dating from about 1330, acquired its charter in 1484. By 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The first candle mould comes from the 15th century in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millhousecandles.com/history.php|title=A Short History of Candles|website=Millhouse Candles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Colonial candle molds at fruitlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'Colonial'-style tapered candle molds]]
With the growth of the [[whaling|whaling industry]] in the 18th century, [[spermaceti]], an oil that comes from a cavity in the head of the [[sperm whale]], became a widely used substance for candle making. The spermaceti was obtained by crystallizing the oil from the sperm whale and was the first candle substance to become available in mass quantities. Like beeswax, spermaceti wax did not create a repugnant odor when burned, and produced a significantly brighter light. It was also harder than either tallow or beeswax, so it would not soften or bend in the summer heat. The first "standard candles" were made from spermaceti wax.

By 1800, an even cheaper alternative was discovered. [[Colza oil]], derived from [[Brassica campestris]], and a similar oil derived from [[rapeseed]], yielded candles that produce clear, smokeless flames. The French chemists [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786–1889) and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850) patented [[stearin]] in 1825. Like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerine content.

===Industrialization===
[[File:Joseph_Morgan_candle_maker.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Morgan's candle making machine revolutionized candle making]]
The manufacture of candles became an industrialised mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan, a pewterer from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour, (according to his patent ". . with three men and five boys [the machine] will manufacture two tons of candle in twelve hours"). This allowed candles to become an easily affordable commodity for the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants plc | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWt03_on0qUC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=4YXvX0eEdKqze7B13yQiKehrgjs | isbn = 1-85757-064-2 | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|left|thumb|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]
At this time, candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as "self-trimming" or "self-consuming" wicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2013-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |archive-date=2013-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 James Young established the world’s first oil refinery at the Alfreton Ironworks in [[Riddings]], [[Derbyshire]]. Two paraffin wax candles were made from the naturally occurring paraffin wax present in the oil and these candles illuminated a lecture at the Royal Institution by Lyon Playfair. In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=james+young+patent+paraffin&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=GVRHQw_E_JpKCMJyDIHh_0mY8uI#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 0-674-01286-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraffin wax was processed by distilling residue left after [[crude petroleum]] was refined. 

Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, burned cleanly, and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. A drawback to the substance was that early coal- and petroleum-derived paraffin waxes had a very low melting point. The introduction of [[stearin]], discovered by [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], solved this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stearin is hard and durable, with a convenient melting range of 54–72.5&amp;nbsp;°C (129.2–162.5&amp;nbsp;°F). By the end of the 19th century, most candles being manufactured consisted of paraffin and stearic acid.

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company traced its origins back to 1829, when William Wilson invested in 1,000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of coconut plantation in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=So7CcAanBJha_PZuwQsHDyhgyeo | isbn = 0-415-24691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to make candles from coconut oil. Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his son George Wilson, a talented chemist, distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854. George also pioneered the implementation of the technique of steam distillation, and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

In America, [[Syracuse, New York]] developed into a global center for [[Industry in Syracuse, New York|candle manufacturing]] from the mid-nineteenth century. Manufacturers included Will &amp; Baumer, Mack Miller, Muench Kruezer, and [[Cathedral Candle Company]].

===Decline of the candle industry===
[[File:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb| Candles here are used to celebrate a birthday]]
Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]].

From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item. Candles became available in a broad array of sizes, shapes and colors, and consumer interest in scented candles began to grow. During the 1990s, new types of candle waxes were being developed due to an unusually high demand for candles. Paraffin, a by-product of oil, was quickly replaced by new waxes and wax blends due to rising costs.

Candle manufacturers looked at waxes such as soy, palm and flax-seed oil, often blending them with paraffin in hopes of getting the performance of paraffin with the price benefits of the other waxes. The creation of unique wax blends, now requiring different fragrance chemistries and loads, placed pressure for innovation on the candle wick manufacturing industry to meet performance needs with the often tougher to burn formulations. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkinsandpearce.com/candle-solutions/new-product-development/ Atkins &amp; Pearce Candle Wick History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hubble Deep Field''' ('''HDF''') is an image of a small region in the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]], constructed from a series of observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28, 1995.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hubble_image" /&gt;

The field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].

Three years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.

==Conception==
[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]

One of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&amp;nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1998&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

After the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="Trauger1994"&gt;Trauger et al. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a "typical" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.&lt;ref name="Williams1996"&gt;Williams et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target selection==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]
[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of the HDF and the 2004 Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]

The field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude, because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus|infrared 'cirrus']], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

These criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)—the areas of sky which are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt; The working group decided to concentrate on the northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.&lt;ref name="north_cvz"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty fields satisfying these criteria were initially identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="north_cvz" /&gt; it is approximately 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,&lt;ref name="Ferguson1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000a"&gt;Ferguson (2000a)&lt;/ref&gt; or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is approximately 1/28,000,000 of the total area of the sky.&lt;ref name=Curious&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/98-the-universe/galaxies/observing-galaxies/535-how-big-is-the-hubble-ultra-deep-field-image-intermediate|title=How big is the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image|date=April 2016|publisher=Curious about astronomy?

==Observations==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field observing geometry.svg|thumb|200px|left|The HDF was in Hubble's northern Continuous Viewing Zone, as shown by this diagram.]]

Once a field had been selected, an observing strategy had to be developed. An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the '[[throughput]]' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

In the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&amp;nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&amp;nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&amp;nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300&amp;nbsp;nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&amp;nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&amp;nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&amp;nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&amp;nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

==Data processing==
[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]
The production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Scattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible "X" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Once the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

The data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&amp;nbsp;nm, 450&amp;nbsp;nm, 606&amp;nbsp;nm and 814&amp;nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1/&gt; One image was designated as red (814&amp;nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&amp;nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&amp;nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image.&lt;ref name=Hubble_image&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|date=1995|title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

(2000b)&lt;/ref&gt; with both [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] and [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] clearly visible, although some galaxies in the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.&lt;ref name="Flynn1996" /&gt;

There are about fifty blue point-like objects in the HDF. Many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense [[star formation]]. Others may be distant [[quasar]]s. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are [[white dwarf]]s, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.&lt;ref name="Hansen1998"&gt;Hansen (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific results==
[[File:HDF extracts showing many galaxies.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Details from the HDF illustrate the wide variety of galaxy shapes, sizes and colours found in the distant universe.]]
The HDF data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations.&lt;ref name="nasa_ads"&gt;&lt;!-- Referencing the _citation count_, not the article --&gt;{{cite journal | title=NASA ADS entry for Williams et al. (1996) | publisher=The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System | bibcode=1996AJ....112.1335W |author1=Williams, Robert E. |author2=Blacker, Brett |author3=Dickinson, Mark |author4=Dixon, W.

As the Universe expands, more distant objects recede from the Earth faster, in what is called the [[Hubble Flow]]. The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|cosmological redshift]]. While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt; The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF ([[Lyman-break galaxy|Lyman-break galaxies]]) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.&lt;ref name=Ferguson2&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDF galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe;&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt; galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in the young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.

The wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of [[star formation]] over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.&lt;ref name="Connolly1997"&gt;Connolly et al. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present.  For years astronomers had been puzzling over the nature of [[dark matter]], mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 90% of the mass of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Trimble1987"&gt;Trimble (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; One theory was that dark matter might consist of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects ([[MACHO]]s)—faint but massive objects such as [[red dwarf]]s and [[planet]]s in the outer regions of galaxies.&lt;ref name="Alcock1992"&gt;Alcock et al. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The HDF showed, however, that there were not significant numbers of red dwarfs in the outer parts of our galaxy.&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flynn1996"&gt;Flynn et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multifrequency followup==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field by Spitzer.jpg|thumb|The HDF imaged by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The top segment shows the foreground objects in the field; the bottom shows the background with the foreground objects removed.]]

Very-high redshift objects (Lyman-break galaxies) cannot be seen in visible light and generally are detected in [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] or [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre]] wavelength surveys of the HDF instead.&lt;ref name=Ferguson2/&gt; Observations with the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation.&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1997"&gt;Rowan-Robinson et al. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Infrared observations have also been made with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope#Continuum detectors|SCUBA]] on the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Observations have also been made with the [[Subaru (telescope)|Subaru]] telescope in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="hdf_clearinghouse"&gt;

X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] revealed six sources in the HDF, which were found to correspond to three elliptical galaxies: one spiral galaxy, one [[active galactic nucleus]] and one extremely red object, thought to be a distant galaxy containing a large amount of [[dust]] absorbing its blue light emissions.&lt;ref name="Hornschemeier2000"&gt;Hornschemeier et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground-based radio images taken using the VLA revealed seven radio sources in the HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images.&lt;ref name="Kellerman1998"&gt;Kellerman et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The field has also been surveyed with the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] and the [[MERLIN]] array of radio telescopes at 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz;&lt;ref name="wsrt"&gt;Garratt et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merlin"&gt;

}}&lt;!-- DEADLINK --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the [[European VLBI Network]] at 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.&lt;ref name="evn"&gt;Garrett et al. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent HST observations==

&lt;/div&gt;

An HDF counterpart in the southern celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the [[Hubble Deep Field South|HDF-South]].&lt;ref name="Williams2000"&gt;Williams et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Created using a similar observing strategy,&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt; the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF.&lt;ref name="Casertano2000"&gt;Casertano et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the [[cosmological principle]] that at its largest scale the Universe is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]]. The HDF-S survey used the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) and the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, as well as by the NICMOS and STIS instruments.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Several [[supernova]] events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt;

A wider survey, but less sensitive, was carried out as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]; a section of this was then observed for longer to create the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]], which was the most sensitive optical deep field image for years&lt;ref name="Beckwith2006"&gt;Beckwith et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble goes to the eXtreme to assemble the deepest ever view of the Universe|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1214/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Hubble press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on 26 September 2012 to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/image/a/ Hubble Site News Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/26/hubble-astronomers-deepest-view-night-sky|Hubble Astronomers Release Deepest View of the Night Sky]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human liquor''' means [[waste]] content from [[bowel]]s isolated to investigate specific [[enzyme]]s and [[peptidase]]s involved in [[enteric]] contraction and [[digestion]] of compounds.

P-endopeptidase isolated from human liquor inactivates [[tachykinin peptides|tachykinins]].  [[Hydrolysis]] of Substance P by P-endopeptidase yields the active fragment of substance P.  A [[neuroactive]] peptide, Substance P is found throughout the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]].  It has mostly been studied for its contractive effect on enteric [[musculature]].

Since the discovery of [[ionizing radiation]], a number of '''human radiation experiments''' have been performed to understand the effects of ionizing radiation and [[radioactive contamination]] on the human body, specifically with the element [[plutonium]].

==Experiments performed in the United States==

{{see also|Unethical human experimentation in the United States#Human radiation experiments}}

Numerous human radiation experiments have been performed in the United States, many of which were funded by various U.S. government agencies&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power. American Nuclear Guinea Pigs: Three Decades of Radiation Experiments on US. Citizens. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[United States Department of Defense]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], and the [[United States Public Health Service]]. Experiments including:
 
* feeding radioactive material to mentally disabled children&lt;ref name=pluto&gt;[[The Plutonium Files]]: America's secret medical experiments in the Cold War, by Eileen Welsome, Dial Press, c1999, New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-385-31402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* enlisting doctors to administer radioactive iron to impoverished pregnant women
* exposing U.S. soldiers and prisoners to high levels of radiation&lt;ref name=pluto /&gt;
* irradiating the [[testicles]] of prisoners, which caused severe [[birth defects]]&lt;ref name=pluto /&gt;
* exhuming bodies from graveyards to test them for radiation (without the consent of the families of the deceased)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/scotorgrev/Documents/Project%20Sunshine%20%20slippery%20slope.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] formed the [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] (ACHRE), chaired by Ruth Faden, Ph.D., MPH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioethicsinstitute.org/mshome/?id=64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171031102538/http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/radiation/ ACHRE homepage, archived]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. One of the primary motivating factors behind his decision to create ACHRE was action taken by his newly appointed Secretary of Energy, Hazel O’Leary, J.D. One of her first actions on taking the reins of the Department of Energy was to announce a new openness policy for the Department. The policy led almost immediately to the release of over 1.6 million pages of classified records. The records made clear that since the 1940s the Atomic Energy Commission had been sponsoring tests on the effects of radiation on the human body. American citizens who had checked into hospitals for a variety of ailments were secretly injected with varying amounts of plutonium and other radioactive materials without their knowledge.  [[Ebb Cade]] was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of [[Plutonium]] on 10 April 1945 at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Moss, William, and Roger Eckhardt. (1995). "The human plutonium injection experiments." [[Los Alamos Science]]. 23: 177-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Openness, DOE. (June 1998). Human Radiation Experiments: ACHRE Report. Chapter 5: The Manhattan district Experiments; the first injection. Washington, DC. Superintendent of Documents US Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment was under the supervision of [[Harold Hodge]].&lt;ref&gt;AEC no. UR-38, 1948 Quarterly Technical Report&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients thought it was "just another injection," but the secret studies left enough radioactive material in many of the patients' bodies to induce life-threatening conditions.  Such experiments were not limited to hospital patients, but included other populations such as those set out above, e.g., orphans fed irradiated milk, children injected with radioactive materials, prisoners in Washington and Oregon state prisons. Much of the experimentation was carried out in order to assess how the human body metabolizes radioactive materials, information that could be used by the Departments of Energy and Defense in [[Cold War]] defense/attack planning.

ACHRE's final report was also a factor in the Department of Energy establishing an Office of Human Radiation Experiments (OHRE) that assured publication of DOE’s involvement (by way of its predecessor, the AEC) in Cold War radiation research and experimentation on human subjects. The final report issued by the ACHRE can be found at the Department of Energy's website.

==Soviet Union==

The [[Soviet nuclear program]] involved human experiments on a large scale, including most notably the [[Totskoye nuclear exercise]] of 1954 and the experiments conducted at the [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] (1949-1989). As of 1950, there were around 700,000 participants at different levels of the program, half of whom were [[Gulag]] prisoners used for radioactivity experiments, as well as the excavation of radioactive ores. Information about the scale, conditions and lethality of those involved in the program is still kept secret by the Russian government and the [[Rosatom (Federal Agency)|Rosatom]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Живущие в стеклянном доме|url = http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/27214509.html|newspaper = Радио Свобода|access-date = 2015-08-31|language = Russian|first = Юрий|last = Федоров}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Slow Death In Kazakhstan's Land Of Nuclear Tests|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/soviet_nuclear_testing_semipalatinsk_20th_anniversary/24311518.html|newspaper = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|date = 2011-08-29|access-date = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other countries ==
In the [[Marshall Islands]], indigenous residents and crewmembers of the fishing boat ''[[Lucky Dragon No. 5]]'' were exposed to the high yields of radioactive testing during the [[Castle Bravo|Castle Bravo explosions]] conducted at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Researchers subsequently exploited this ostensibly unexpected turn of events by conducting research on the onset of effects from [[radiation poisoning]] as part of [[Project 4.1]], raising ethical questions as to both the specific incident and the broader phenomenon of testing in populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skoog|first=Kim|title=U.S. NUCLEAR TESTING ON THE MARSHALL ISLANDS: 1946 TO 1958|url=http://www.uvu.edu/ethics/seac/US%20Nuclear%20Testing%20on%20the%20Marshal%20Islands.pdf|publisher=University of Guam|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the Venezuelan geneticist [[Marcel Roche]] was implicated in Patrick Tierney's 2000 publication, ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'', for allegedly administering [[radioactive iodine]] to indigenous peoples in the [[Orinoco|Orinoco basin]] of [[Venezuela]], such as the [[Yanomami]] and [[Makiritare|Ye'Kwana]] peoples, in cooperation with the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], possibly with no apparent benefit for the test group and without obtaining proper informed consent. This corresponded to similar administrations of [[iodine-124]] by the French anthropologist Jacques Lizot in cooperation with the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0352.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0470.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ITIL security management''' (originally Information Technology Infrastructure Library) describes the structured fitting of security into an organization. [[ITIL]] security management is based on the ISO 27001 standard. "ISO/IEC 27001:2005 covers all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for profit organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=42103|title=ISO/IEC 27001:2005 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management systems -- Requirements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization's overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets and give confidence to interested parties."

A basic concept of security management is [[information security]]. The primary goal of information security is to control access to information. The value of the information is what must be protected. These values include [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] and [[availability]]. Inferred aspects are privacy, anonymity and verifiability.

The goal of security management comes in two parts:

* [[Security]] requirements defined in [[service level agreement]]s (SLA) and other external requirements that are specified in underpinning contracts, legislation and possible internal or external imposed policies.
* Basic security that guarantees management continuity. This is necessary to achieve simplified service-level management for information security.

SLAs define security requirements, along with legislation (if applicable) and other contracts. These requirements can act as [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) that can be used for process management and for interpreting the results of the security management process.

The security management process relates to other ITIL-processes. However, in this particular section the most obvious relations are the relations to the [[service level management]], [[incident management]] and [[change management]] processes.

== Security management ==

Security management is a continuous process that can be compared to [[W. Edwards Deming]]'s Quality Circle ([[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]]).

The inputs are requirements from clients. The requirements are translated into security services and security metrics. Both the client and the plan sub-process affect the SLA. The SLA is an input for both the client and the process. The provider develops security plans for the organization. These plans contain policies and operational level agreements. The security plans (Plan) are then implemented (Do) and the implementation is then evaluated (Check). After the evaluation, the plans and the plan implementation are maintained (Act).

The activities, results/products and the process are documented. External reports are written and sent to the clients. The clients are then able to adapt their requirements based on the information received through the reports. Furthermore, the service provider can adjust their plan or the implementation based on their findings in order to satisfy all the requirements stated in the SLA (including new requirements).

===Control===

The first activity in the security management process is the “Control” sub-process. The Control sub-process organizes and manages the security management process. The Control sub-process defines the processes, the allocation of responsibility for the policy statements and the management framework.

The security management framework defines the sub-processes for development, implementation and evaluations into action plans. Furthermore, the management framework defines how results should be reported to clients.

|-
| Reporting

|}

The meta-process model of the control sub-process is based on a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]] and gives an overview of the activities of the Control sub-process. The grey rectangle represents the control sub-process and the smaller beam shapes inside it represent activities that take place inside it.

[[Image:Control Process model.jpg]]

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Concept !! Description
|-
| Control documents
| Control is a description of how security management is organized and how it is managed.
|-
| Policy statements
| Policy statements outline specific requirements or rules that must be met. In the [[information security]] realm, policies are usually point-specific, covering a single area. For example, "acceptable use" policies cover the rules and regulations for appropriate use of the computing facilities.
|-
| Security management framework
| Security management framework is an established management framework to initiate and control the implementation of information security within an organization and to manage ongoing information security provision.
|}

The meta-data model of the control sub-process is based on a UML [[class diagram]]. Figure 2.1.2 shows the metamodel of the control sub-process.

[[Image:Control Data model.JPG]]

Figure 2.1.2: Meta-process model control sub-process

The CONTROL rectangle with a white shadow is an open complex concept. This means that the Control rectangle consists of a collection of (sub) concepts.

Figure 2.1.3 is the process data model of the control sub-process. It shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate the concepts that are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities.

[[Image:Control Process data model.JPG]]

Figure 2.1.3: Process-data model control sub-process

===Plan===

The Plan sub-process contains activities that in cooperation with [[service level management]] lead to the (information) Security section in the SLA. Furthermore, the Plan sub-process contains activities that are related to the underpinning contracts which are specific for (information) security.

In the Plan sub-process the goals formulated in the SLA are specified in the form of operational level agreements (OLA). These OLA’s can be defined as security plans for a specific internal organization entity of the service provider.

Besides the input of the SLA, the Plan sub-process also works with the policy statements of the service provider itself. As said earlier these policy statements are defined in the control sub-process.

The operational level agreements for [[information security]] are set up and implemented based on the ITIL process. This requires cooperation with other ITIL processes. For example, if security management wishes to change the [[IT infrastructure]] in order to enhance security, these changes will be done through the [[change management]] process. Security management delivers the input (Request for change) for this change. The Change Manager is responsible for the change management process.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.2.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Plan sub-process ITIL Security Management
! Activities !! Sub-activities !! Descriptions
|-
| rowspan=4 | Plan

| This process contains activities that lead to the security agreements paragraph in the service level agreements. At the end of this process the ''Security'' section of the service level agreement is created.
|-

| This process contains activities that lead to underpinning contracts. These contracts are specific for security.
|-
| Create operational level agreements
| The general formulated goals in the SLA are specified in operational level agreements. These agreements can be seen as security plans for specific organization units.
|-
| Reporting
| In this process the whole Create plan process is documented in a specific way. This process ends with reports.
|}

Plan consists of a combination of unordered and ordered (sub) activities. The sub-process contains three complex activities that are all closed activities and one standard activity.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.2.2: Concept and definition Plan sub-process security management

|-
| Operational level agreements
| An internal agreement covering the delivery of services which support the IT organization in their delivery of services.
|}

Just as the Control sub-process the Plan sub-process is modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The left side of figure 2.2.1 is the meta-data model of the Plan sub-process.

The Plan rectangle is an open (complex) concept which has an aggregation type of relationship with two closed (complex) concepts and one standard concept. The two closed concepts are not expanded in this particular context.

The following picture (figure 2.2.1) is the [[process-data diagram]] of the Plan sub-process. This picture shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate which concepts are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities of the Plan sub-process.

[[Image:Plan process data model.jpg]]

Figure 2.2.1: Process-data model Plan sub-process

===Implementation===

The Implementation sub-process makes sure that all measures, as specified in the plans, are properly implemented. During the Implementation sub-process no measures are defined nor changed. The definition or change of measures takes place in the Plan sub-process in cooperation with the Change Management Process.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| Implement personnel security
| Measures are adopted to give personnel safety and confidence and measures to prevent a crime/fraud. The process ends with ''personnel security''.
|-

|-
| Reporting
| The whole ''implement as planned process'' is documented in a specific way. This process ends with ''reports''.
|}

The left side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-process model of the Implementation phase. The four labels with a black shadow mean that these activities are closed concepts and they are not expanded in this context. No arrows connect these four activities, meaning that these activities are unordered and the reporting will be carried out after the completion of all four activities.

During the implementation phase concepts are created and /or adjusted.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.3.2: Concept and definition Implementation sub-process Security management
! Concept !! Description
|-
| Implementation
| Accomplished security management according to the security management plan.
|-

|-

| Well defined job descriptions for all staff outlining security roles and responsibilities.
|-
| Security policies
| Documents that outline specific security requirements or security rules that must be met.
|-
| Access control
| Network management to ensure that only those with the appropriate responsibility have access to information in the networks and the protection of the supporting infrastructure.
|}

The concepts created and/or adjusted are modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The right side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-data model of the implementation sub-process.

Implementation documents are an open concept and is expanded upon in this context. It consists of four closed concepts that are not expanded because they are irrelevant in this particular context.

In order to make the relations between the two models clearer the integration of the two models is illustrated in Figure 2.3.1. The dotted arrows running from the activities to the concepts illustrate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities.

Figure 2.3.1: Process-data model Implementation sub-process

===Evaluation===

Evaluation is necessary to measure the success of the implementation and security plans. The evaluation is important for clients (and possibly third parties). The results of the Evaluation sub-process are used to maintain the agreed measures and the implementation. Evaluation results can lead to new requirements and a corresponding [[Request for Change]]. The request for change is then defined and sent to Change Management.

The three sorts of evaluation are self-assessment, internal audit and external audit.

The self-assessment is mainly carried out in the organization of the processes. Internal audits are carried out by internal IT-auditors. External audits are carried out by external, independent IT-auditors. Besides those already mentioned, an evaluation based on communicated security incidents occurs. The most important activities for this evaluation are the security monitoring of IT-systems; verify the security legislation and security plan implementation; trace and react to undesirable use of IT-supplies.

The dotted arrows running from the meta-process diagram (left) to the meta-data diagram (right) indicate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities. All of the activities in the evaluation phase are standard activities. For a short description of the Evaluation phase concepts see Table 2.4.2 where the concepts are listed and defined.

===Maintenance===

Because of organizational and IT-infrastructure changes, security risks change over time, requiring revisions to the security section of service level agreements and security plans.

Maintenance is based on the results of the Evaluation sub-process and insight in the changing risks. These activities will produce proposals. The proposals either serve as inputs for the plan sub-process and travel through the cycle or can be adopted as part of maintaining service level agreements. In both cases the proposals could lead to activities in the action plan. The actual changes are made by the Change Management process.

Figure 2.5.1: Process-data model Maintenance sub-process

The maintenance sub-process starts with the maintenance of the service level agreements and the maintenance of the operational level agreements. After these activities take place (in no particular order) and there is a request for a change the request for change activity will take place and after the request for change activity is concluded the reporting activity starts. If there is no request for a change then the reporting activity will start directly after the first two activities. The concepts in the meta-data model are created/ adjusted during the maintenance phase. For a list of the concepts and their definition take a look at table 2.5.2.

== Relations with other ITIL processes ==

The Security Management Process, as stated in the introduction, has relations with almost all other ITIL-processes. These processes are:

* IT Customer Relationship Management &lt;!-- I don't believe that this is actually an ITIL process --&gt;
* [[Service Level Management]]
* Availability Management
* Capacity Management
* IT Service Continuity Management
* Configuration Management
* [[Release Management]]
* Incident Management &amp; Service Desk
* Problem Management
* [[Change Management (ITSM)]]

Within these processes activities concerning security are required. The concerning process and its process manager are responsible for these activities. However, Security Management gives indications to the concerning process on how to structure these activities.

== Example: internal e-mail policies ==

Internal e-mail is subject to multiple security risks, requiring corresponding security plan and policies. In this example the ITIL security Management approach is used to implement e-mail policies.

The Security management team is formed and process guidelines are formulated and communicated to all employees and providers. These actions are carried out in the Control phase.

In the subsequent Planning phase, policies are formulated. Policies specific to e-mail security are formulated and added to service level agreements. At the end of this phase the entire plan is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is done according to the plan.

After implementation the policies are evaluated, either as self-assessments, or via internal or external auditors.

In the maintenance phase the e-policies are adjusted based on the evaluation. Needed changes are processed via Requests for Change.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Ardrey| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Ardrey
| title = African Genesis: A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man
| year = 1961 | publisher = [[Atheneum Books]]| location = New York
| isbn = 978-0-00-211014-3 | oclc = 556678068 | lccn = 61015889
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yg1AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Dart| first = Raymond Arthur| authorlink = Raymond Dart

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Lorenz | first = Konrad | authorlink = Konrad Lorenz
| title = On Aggression
| year = 1966 | publisher = [[Methuen Publishing]] | location = London
| isbn = 978-0-415-28320-5 | oclc = 72226348| lccn = 67072318
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">The '''Lincoln's Birthday Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom''' ('''LBCDIF''') was an [[antifascist]] organization of [[scientists]] founded by [[Franz Boas]] in 1938 to discredit the theories of race being forwarded by the [[Nazis]] in [[Germany]]. 

In the 1930s Franz Boas was one of the first scientists to become aware of the immense prestige and influence of scientists in that era. Even at his advanced age Boas wanted to find a way to use the influence of scientists to promote human welfare. At [[Columbia University]] he collaborated with [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Leslie Dunn]], [[Robert Staughton Lynd|Robert Lynd]], [[Walter Rautenstrauch]], [[Harold Urey]] and other members of the [[University Federation for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom]] to find a unifying political position that would bring scientists of all disciplines together on a common front. He decided antifascism was such a position, and based on his collaborations wrote the [[Manifesto on Freedom in Science]]. In 1938 the Manifesto was released with 1,284 signatures of prominent scientists, including [[Roger Adams]], [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Albert Einstein]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110616123216/http://www.alberteinstein.info/High/28-468.jpg (see: Einstein Letter to LBCDIF)]. Boas used the excitement generated by the Manifesto to launch the LBCDIF.  Twenty-six meetings were organized to uphold the principles of the Manifesto, and the success of these meetings encouraged the organizers to expand the Birthday Committee to an ongoing group called the [[American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom]] (ACDIF).

'''Medical simulation,''' or more broadly, '''healthcare simulation,''' is a branch of [[simulation]] related to education and training in medical fields of various industries. Simulations can be held in the classroom, in situ, or in spaces built specifically for simulation practice.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; It can involve simulated human patients - artificial, human or a combination of the two, educational documents with detailed simulated animations, casualty assessment in [[homeland security]] and military situations, [[emergency response]], and support virtual health functions with holographic simulation. In the past, its main purpose was to train medical professionals to reduce error during surgery, prescription, crisis interventions, and general practice. Combined with methods in '''debriefing''', it is now also used to train students in anatomy, physiology, and communication during their schooling. This occurs in professions which include medicine, nursing, sonography, pharmacy assistants, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and more.  Medical simulation is somewhat unique, as it is continuously evolving to function across the medical operations, patient care and clinical spaces, with the future of medical simulation blurring the line between these sectors of medicine.  Advances in technology are advancing geometrically and a McGraw Hill textbook, Medical Simulation, by VanCura and Bisset interfaces the simulator technology with any medically related course of study.

Many medical professionals are skeptical about simulation, saying that medicine, surgery, and general healing skills are too complex to simulate accurately. However, technological advances in the past two decades have made it possible to simulate practices from yearly family doctor visits to complex operations such as heart surgery. Research regarding healthcare simulation has advanced and proliferated in the past decade. There exists dedicated websites to the field including [https://www.thesimtech.com theSimTech.com] and [https://www.Healthysimulation.com HealthySimulation.com] and several academic peer reviewed journals including: [http://www.ssih.org/News/Journal Simulation in Healthcare], [https://www.nursingsimulation.org/ Clinical Simulation in Nursing], [https://stel.bmj.com/ BMJ Simulation &amp; Technology Enhanced Learning] and [https://advancesinsimulation.biomedcentral.com/ Advances in Simulation].

An increase in recent emergency and military scenario simulation has helped medical providers in Middle East war zones.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Disaster response is made easier and conducted by better trained individuals due to the rapid availability of simulators in schools, hospitals, military facilities, and research labs.

==History==
[[File:Link-trainer-ts.jpg|thumb|Link Trainer.]]

The first uses of medical simulation can be traced back to the first time that a person utilized something other than a patient in order to train, hone, or sustain medical skills.  Modern day simulation for training was first utilized by [[anesthesia]] physicians in order to reduce accidents.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt; When simulation skyrocketed in popularity during the 1930s due to the invention of the [[Link Trainer]] for flight and military applications, many different field experts attempted to adapt simulation to their own needs. Due to limitations in technology and overall medical knowledge to a specific degree at the time, medical simulation did not take off as acceptable training until much later.&lt;ref name="academicResident"&gt;Chakravarthy, Bharath. Academic Resident.  Medical Simulation in EM Training and Beyond&lt;/ref&gt; When the sheer cost effectiveness and training of which simulation was capable surfaced during extensive military use, hardware/software technology increased exponentially, and medical standards were established, medical simulation became entirely possible and affordable, although it remained un-standardized, and not widely accepted by the larger medical community.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;

By the 1980s software simulations became available. With the help of a [[UCSD School of Medicine]] student, ''Computer Gaming World'' reported that ''Surgeon'' (1986) for the [[Apple Macintosh]] very accurately simulated operating on an [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref name="boosman1988611"&gt;{{cite news | title=Macintosh Windows | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&amp;pub=2&amp;id=32 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1986 | accessdate=1 November 2013 | author=Boosman, Frank | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed, such as ''[[Life &amp; Death]]'' (1988).

In 2002, the [[Society for Simulation in Healthcare]] (SSH) was formed to become a leader in international interprofessional advances the application of medical simulation in healthcare&lt;ref name=Riley2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Riley|title=Chapter 38: Society for Simulation in Healthcare by Raemer, Dan IN: Manual of Simulation in Healthcare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oABbAg2sjxYC&amp;pg=PA532|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920585-1|pages=532–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for a "uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession" was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research.&lt;ref name=pmid20078756&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGaghie WC, Issenberg SB, Petrusa ER, Scalese RJ |title=A critical review of simulation-based medical education research: 2003-2009 |journal=Medical Education |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=50–63 |year=2010 |pmid=20078756 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need.&lt;ref name=StruijkASPE2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Struijk, Jennie |title=Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) – an update for ASPE |date=2013-04-11 |journal=Association of Standardized Patient Educators News |url=http://aspenews.org/2013/04/11/certified-healthcare-simulation-educator-chse-an-update-for-aspe/ |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern medical simulation==
The American Board of Emergency Medicine employs the use of medical simulation technology in order to accurately judge students by using "patient scenarios" during oral board examinations.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt; However, these forms of simulation are a far cry from high [[fidelity]] models that have surfaced since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed K, Jawad M, Abboudi M, Gavazzi A, Darzi A, Athanasiou T, Vale J, Khan MS, Dasgupta P. Effectiveness of Procedural Simulation in Urology: A Systematic Review.  J Urol. 2011 May 13. {{PMID|21571338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that computer simulation technology is still relatively new with regard to flight and military simulators, there is still much research to be done about the best way to approach medical training through simulation, which continues to remain un-standardized although much more universally accepted and embraced by the medical community. That said, successful strides are being made in terms of medical education and training. Although amount of studies have shown that students engaged in medical simulation training have overall higher scores and retention rates than those trained through traditional means.&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;

The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) has established the following recommendations for simulation&lt;ref name="academicResident" /&gt;
# Simulation is a useful tool for training residents and in ascertaining competency.  The core competencies most conducive to simulation-based training are patient care, interpersonal skills, and systems based practice.
# It is appropriate for performance assessment but there is a scarcity of evidence that supports the validity of simulation in the use for promotion or certification.
# There is a need for standardization and definition in using simulation to evaluate performance.
# Scenarios and tools should also be formatted and standardized such that EM educators can use the data and count on it for reproducibility, reliability and validity.

The [[Association of Surgeons in Training]] has produced recommendations for the introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milburn|first=J.A.|author2=Khera, G. |author3=Hornby, S.T. |author4=Malone, P.S.C. |author5= Fitzgerald, J.E.F. |title=Introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical education and training: Review of current evidence and recommendations from the Association of Surgeons in Training|journal=International Journal of Surgery|year=2012|volume=10|issue=8|pages=393–398|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.005|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical Skills and Simulations Centers (CSSC) for Medical Simulation ==

The two main types of medical institutes train people in the latest medical simulations are medical schools and teaching hospitals. According to survey results from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) simulation content taught at medical schools are done throughout all four years of study while hospitals use simulations during the residency and subspecialty period. Internal medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics / gynecology, pediatrics, surgery and anesthesiology are the most common areas taught in medical schools and hospitals.&lt;ref name=AAMC&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Passiment|first1=Morgan|last2=Sacks|first2=Heather|last3=Huang|first3=Grace|title=Medical Simulation in Medical Education: Results of an AAMC Survey|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The AAMC reported that there were six main types of facility location, centralized, decentralized, mobile units, other or a small mixture of centralized &amp; decentralized and centralized &amp; mobile. Most CSSC are owned by the facilities, 84% for medical schools and 90% for teaching hospitals, the majority of simulation centers where housed in a centralized location, 77% for medical schools and 59% for teaching hospitals.&lt;ref name=AAMC /&gt; Common medical school CSSC locations contain rooms for debriefs training/scenario, exam /standardized patient rooms, partial task trainer, offices, observation area, control room, class and storage. On average a medical schools CSSC can have around 27 rooms dedicated to training with simulations.&lt;ref name=AAMC /&gt;

==Debriefing &amp; Education in Medical Simulation==
[[File:PHOTOS INSIDE THE CLASSROOM UPDATED014.jpg|thumb|500px|Example of a Medical Simulation]]
The origins of [[debriefing]] can be traced back to the military, whereby upon return from a mission or war game exercise, participants were asked to gather as a group and recount what had happened.&lt;ref name=Pearson1986&gt;Pearson, M . &amp; Smith, D. (1986). Debriefing in experience-based learning. ''Simulation/Games for Learning'', 16, 155-172.&lt;/ref&gt; These gatherings had the primary intention of developing new strategies to use in future encounters; these gatherings also provided a learning opportunity for other members of the team who were not present at the events being debriefed.

In the field of [[psychology]], debriefing is used in the processing of traumatic events. Here, the emphasis is on the narrative; in a facilitator-led environment, participants reconstruct what happened and review facts, share reactions, and develop a shared meaning of the events. The aim is to reduce stress, accelerate normal recovery, and assist in both the cognitive and emotional processing of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J.T. &amp; Everly, G.S. (1993). ''Critical incident stress debriefing: An operations manual for the prevention of traumatic stress among emergency services and disaster workers''. Ellicott City, MD: Chevron Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyregrov, A. (1989). Caring for helpers in disaster situations: Psychological debriefing. ''Disaster Management'', 2. 25-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all instances, debriefing is the process by which people who have gone through an experience are intentionally and thoughtfully led through a discussion of that experience.&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearson1986 /&gt; Debriefing in simulation is a critical component of learning in simulation and is necessary to facilitate change “on an individual and systematic level”.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013&gt;Sawyer, T. L., &amp; Deering, S. (2013). Adaptation of the US Army’s after-action review for simulation debriefing in healthcare. Simulation in Healthcare, 8(6), 388-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dieckmann2009&gt;Dieckmann, P.,  Friis, S.M.,  Lippert, A.,  &amp; Østergaard, D. (2009). The art and science of debriefing in simulation: Ideal and practice, ''Medical Teacher'', 31(7), 287-294, DOI: 10.1080/01421590902866218&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|e287}} It draws from the above-mentioned forms of debriefing, but the emphasis here is on education. Debriefing in education can be described as a “facilitator-led participant discussion of events, reflection, and assimilation of activities into [participants’] cognitions [which] produce long-lasting learning”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; More specific descriptions of debriefing can be found, such as the following in relation to debriefing in healthcare simulations, described by Cheng et al. (2014): “...a discussion between two or more individuals in which aspects of a performance are explored and analysed with the aim of gaining insights that impact the quality of future clinical practice”.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;{{rp|658}} Or another regarding debriefing in gaming, by Steinwachs (1992), “…a time to reflect on and discover together what happened during game play and what it all means."&lt;ref name="Steinwachs1992"/&gt;{{rp|187}}

===Debriefing in Medical Simulation===
Medical simulation is often defined as, “a technique (not a technology) to replace and amplify real life experiences with guided ones, often “immersive” in nature, that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive fashion”.&lt;ref name=Lateef2010&gt;Lateef, F. (2010). Simulation-based learning: Just like the real thing. ''Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock''. 3(4), 348-352.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition deliberately defines simulation as a technique and not a technology, implying that simulation is greater than the technology or tools which it adopts. Also note the use of the word ''guided'' in the definition, further implying that the interactions which occur in a simulated environment are not left solely to those persons immersed in the simulation, but that a “guide” also be present. This guide may be virtual in nature, such as prompts from a computer program, or may be physically present, in the form of an instructor or teacher. The human guide is often referred to as a “facilitator”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007&gt;Fanning, R.M., &amp; Gaba, D.M. (2007). The role of debriefing in simulation-based learning. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 2(2), 115-125. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0b013e3180315539&lt;/ref&gt; It is this facilitator who guides the debriefing which occurs after a simulation scenario has completed.

Indeed, for simulation to be of value and for learning to occur, there must be “…instructional elements that help a learner explore, navigate or obtain more information about that system or environment [being simulated] that cannot generally be acquired from mere experimentation”.&lt;ref name=IS2017&gt;Instructional Simulation. (n.d.) In ''Wikipedia''. Retrieved July 3, 2017 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_simulation&lt;/ref&gt; When these elements are present, the simulation is often referred to as “Instructional simulation,” “Educational simulation,”&lt;ref name=IS2017 /&gt; or “Simulation-based learning”.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; Favourable and statistically significant effects for nearly all knowledge and process skill outcomes when comparing simulation AND debriefing versus simulation with no intervention (in healthcare) has been shown.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014&gt;Cheng, A., Eppich, W., Grant, V., Sherbina, J., Zendejas, B., &amp; Cook, D. (2014). Debriefing for technology-enhanced simulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ''Medical Education'', 48, 657-666. DOI: 10.1111/medu.12432&lt;/ref&gt; When applied in a capacity to further professional development, simulation and debriefing may be referred to as “Simulation-based training”.&lt;ref name=Ziv2003&gt;Ziv, A., Wolpe, P.R., Small, S.D.,  &amp; Glick, S. (2003). Simulation-Based Medical Education: An Ethical Imperative. ''Academic Medicine'', 78(8), 783-787&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simulation, Debriefing, &amp; Education Theory ===

[[Experiential learning]], which draws from prominent scholars such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Carl Rogers]], amongst others,&lt;ref name=Kolb2005&gt;Kolb, A.Y. &amp; Kolb, D.A. (2005). Learning Styles and Learning Spaces: Enhancing Experiential Learning in Higher Education. ''Academy of Management &amp; Learning Education'', 4(2), 193-212.&lt;/ref&gt; underpins simulation-based learning.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992&gt;Lederman, L. C. (1992). Debriefing: Toward a systematic assessment of theory and practice. ''Simulation &amp; gaming,'' 23(2), 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016&gt;Sawyer, T., Eppich, W., Grant, V., Brett-Fleegler, M., &amp; Cheng, A. (2016). More Than One Way to Debrief: A Critical Review of Healthcare Simulation Debriefing Methods. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 11, 209-217. DOI: 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011&gt;Zigmont, J. J., Kappus, L. J., &amp; Sudikoff, S. N. (2011, April). The 3D model of debriefing: defusing, discovering, and deepening. ''Seminars in perinatology,'' 35(2), 52-58. WB Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as “learning by doing”,&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; or more broadly, a “theory of experience”,&lt;ref name=Dewey1938&gt;Dewey, J. (1938). ''Education and experience''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential Learning Theory states that experience plays a central role in human learning &amp; development.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;
The six principles of Experiential Learning Theory align with educational simulation. The six principles are:
#	Engaging students in a process that enhances learning. This includes “feedback on the effectiveness of their learning efforts,” (p.&amp;nbsp;194) and focus on the process, not the outcome.
#	Students have prior beliefs and ideas. A process which draws these beliefs &amp; ideas out, with the intent of re-examining &amp; re-testing them against a topic in order to accommodate new ideas, will lead to learning.
#	Learning is a process which cycles between reflection and action, feeling and thinking. “Conflict, differences, and disagreement are what drive the learning process” (p.&amp;nbsp;194); the resolution of these is what leads to learning.
#	Learning happens in interactions between the person and the environment which surrounds them. 
#	Learning is more than cognition; it also involves thinking, feeling, perceiving, and behaving.
#	Learning is grounded in constructivist philosophy; “Learning is the process of creating knowledge”.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;{{rp|194}}

Simulation also aligns with Guided [[Discovery learning]]. Developed by [[Jerome Bruner]] in the 1960s, discovery learning also stems from the work of Jean Piaget and can be described as a learning environment where there is little to no instructor-guidance.&lt;ref name=Mayer2004&gt;Mayer, R. E. (2004). Should there be a three-strikes rule against pure discovery learning?. ''American psychologist,'' 59(1), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Guided discovery learning, on the other hand, continues to place learners in a discovery environment, but where an instructor is available to help guide learning via coaching, feedback, hints, and/or modeling.&lt;ref name=Mayer2004 /&gt;

Both Experiential &amp; Discovery Learning are based on constructivist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Kolb2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer2004 /&gt; Broadly, [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] is based on the belief that learning is an active process whereby learners make sense of new knowledge by building upon their prior experiences; each person has a unique set of experiences which frame their interpretation of information.&lt;ref&gt;Fosnot, C. T., &amp; Perry, R. S. (1996). Constructivism: A psychological theory of learning. ''Constructivism: Theory, perspectives, and practice'', 2, 8-33. New York &amp; London: Teachers College Press, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debriefing Frameworks===
While many models for debriefing exist, they all follow, at a minimum, a three-phase format.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederman1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sawyer2016"/&gt; Debriefing models can be divided into two categories: the “Three-Phase Debriefing Structure,” and the “Multiphase Debriefing Structure”.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;

==== Three-Phase Debriefing Structure ====
A benchmark in all forms of facilitator-guided, post-event debriefing conversational structures, the three conventional phases of debriefing are: description, analysis, and application.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015&gt;Jaye, P., Thomas, L., &amp; Reedy, G. (2015). ‘The Diamond’: a structure for simulation debrief. ''The Clinical Teacher'', 12, 171-175. DOI: 10.1111/tct.12300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; Frameworks which make use of the three-phase debriefing format include Debriefing with Good Judgment,&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt; the 3D Model,&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; the GAS model,&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt; and Diamond Debrief.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;

Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and "identify what happened,"&lt;ref name="Sawyer2013"/&gt; the description phase of debriefing sees simulation participants describing and exploring their reactions, emotions, and overall impact of the experience.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;  It is the opening phase of systematic reflection, enabled by a facilitator who poses key questions such as:
*	“How did that feel?” 
*	“How did that go?” 
*	“Can you take us through the scenario as it unfolded?”&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;
A facilitator is to keep asking these questions of the learners until they feel confident that all participants have voiced their understanding of the situation.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt; The point of the description phase is to identify the impact of the experience, gain insights into what mattered to the participants throughout the simulation, and to establish a shared mental model of the events which occurred.&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt; A debate in the healthcare simulation community exists regarding the exploration of feelings in the descriptive phase. One camp believes that the descriptive phase should allow an opportunity for participants to “blow off steam,” and release any tension which may have accumulated during the simulation scenario in order for learners to continue the debrief and subsequent reflection without pent-up emotion.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Others believe that the “venting” phase is not necessary and may explicitly make this statement in their debriefing models, or simply omit any reference to emotions or feelings at all.&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;

===== ''Analysis'' =====
The second phase of debriefing is often referred to as “analysis,”&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; "description,"&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt; or "discovering".&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; This is the phase in which the bulk of the time of debriefing is spent, with a focus on participant performance, rationales, &amp; frames.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;  It is meant to be a time of reflective practice on what actually occurred during the scenario, and the reasons why events unfolded as they did.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; The analysis phase uncovers the decision-making process behind observed actions.&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:
*	“Tell me about [insert performance/event here, i.e. teamwork] during the scenario.”&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;
*	“What went well? Why?”
*	“What made things challenging?”
*	“Why do you think that happened?”
Participant performance is a key component during the analysis phase. However, performance can often be a difficult topic to broach with participants, as criticism or constructive feedback often incur negative feelings. There exists a framework for questioning named “Advocacy-Inquiry,” or the “debriefing with good judgment” approach, which aims to reduce negative experiences in medical simulation debriefing.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;

'''Advocacy Inquiry.''' The use of advocacy-inquiry (AI) questioning is highly encouraged by nearly all authors of debriefing models.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; Advocacy-inquiry consists of pairing “an assertion, observation, or statement” (advocacy), together with a question (inquiry), in order to elicit the mental frameworks – or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] – of both the facilitator and the participants.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;{{rp|53}} In phrasing questions this way, participants are made aware of the facilitator’s own point of view in relation to the question being posed. Note that the use of AI is most encouraged when a facilitator has a judgment about something which was observed during the simulation scenario. Using AI eliminates the tone of judgment as well as the “guess what I’m thinking” which can occur when asking questions.

===== ''Application'' =====
The third and final phase of three-phase debriefing structures is most commonly referred to as “application,"&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt; or "summary".&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phrampus2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt; Participants are asked to move any newly acquired insights and/or knowledge gained throughout the simulation experience forward to their daily activities or thought processes.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; This includes learning which may have occurred during the previous phases in the debriefing process. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:
*	“What are you going to do differently in your practice tomorrow?”&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;
*	“What new insights have you gained?”
*	“What one thing will you commit to doing differently after this?”
Note that the summary here is not always in terms of re-stating the major points which were visited throughout the simulation &amp; debrief, but more so emphasize the greatest impact of learning. The summary may be done by either the facilitator or the participants – debriefing models differ in which they suggest. In the latter, the participants summarize what was of most value for them.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt; A summary by the facilitator consists of re-stating key learning points which occurred throughout the debrief.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;

==== Multi-Phase Debriefing Structure ====
While all debriefing models include the phases of the three-part debriefing structure, there are several with additional phases. These additions either explicitly call out specific features which may be included in the three-part debriefing model, such as reviewing learning objectives, or provide additional process recommendations, such as immediately re-practicing any skills involved in the original simulation scenario.&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt; Examples of multi-phase debriefing structures include the Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS) framework,&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt; TeamGAINS,&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt; and Healthcare Simulation After-Action Review (AAR).&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;

=== Learning Objectives ===
As with any other educational initiative, [[learning objective]]s are of paramount importance in simulation and debriefing. Without learning objectives, simulations themselves and the subsequent debriefs are aimless, disorganized, and often dysfunctional. Most debriefing models explicitly make mention of stating learning objectives.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaye2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt;

The exploration of learning objectives ought to answer at least two questions: What competencies – knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes – are to be learned, and what specifically should be learned about them?&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; The method of debriefing chosen should align with learning objectives through evaluation of three points: performance domain – cognitive, technical, or behavioural; evidence for rationale – yes/no; and estimated length of time to address – short, moderate, or long.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;

Learning objectives may be predetermined and included in the development of a simulation scenario, or they may be emergent as the scenario unfolds.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; It can be challenging for the novice facilitator to adapt to emergent learning objectives, as the subsequent discussion may be purely exploratory in nature with no defined outcome. Conversely, the discussion may lead to a specific area of expertise which neither the facilitator nor participants are familiar with. In such situations, the facilitator and participants must be flexible and move on to the next objective, and follow-up with the debriefing of the emergent outcome at a later time.

=== Environment ===
The debriefing environment consists of two main features: the physical setting, as well as the psychological environment.

==== Physical setting ====
When choosing a space in which to debrief, one must consider whether the scenario which unfolded was a complex case. Complex cases usually involve heightened emotions, interdependent processes, and require more time spent debriefing. As such, it is recommended that these types of debriefings occur in a separate room from where the simulation scenario took place. This allows for a release of tension as participants move from one place to another and encounter new surroundings.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt; Note, however, that it is important to remind participants not to begin debriefing during the walk to the new room. The momentum of the simulation leads participants to begin debriefing with one another as soon the scenario has finished.&lt;ref name=Steinwachs1992&gt;Steinwachs, B. (1992). How to facilitate a debriefing. ''Simulation &amp; Gaming'', 23(2), 186-195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to establish a shared mental model with all participants, debriefing must occur in a fashion whereby all participants can hear one another and have a chance to respond. This is difficult to accomplish while walking down a hallway, or in any disorganized fashion.

The location of the debriefing is ideally somewhere comfortable and conducive to conversation and reflection, where chairs can be maneuvered and manipulated.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2013 /&gt; It is recommended that, during the debriefing, the facilitator(s) and/or participants be seated in a circle.&lt;ref name=Steinwachs1992 /&gt; This is done so that everyone can see each other and increase group cohesion. Furthermore, the use of a circle implies equality amongst the group, and decreases any sense of hierarchy which may be present.

==== Psychological environment ====
Establishing psychological safety and a safe learning environment is of utmost importance within both the simulation and the debriefing period.&lt;ref name=Eppich2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014&gt;Rudolph, J.W., Raemer, D.B., &amp; Simon, R. (2014). Establishing a Safe Container for Learning in Simulation: The Role of Presimulation Briefing. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 9, 339-349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zigmont2011 /&gt; As simulation participants often find the experience stressful and intimidating, worried about judgment from their peers and facilitator(s), establishing safety must be done from the outset of the simulation event.&lt;ref&gt;Savoldelli, G.L., Naik, V.N., Hamstra, S.J. &amp; Morgan, P.J. (2005). Barriers to the use of simulation-based education. ''Can J Anesth'', 52(9), 944-950. DOI: 10.1007/BF03022056&lt;/ref&gt; Note that psychological safety does not necessarily equate to comfort, but rather that participants “feel safe enough to embrace being uncomfortable…without the burden of feeling that they will be shamed, humiliated, or belittled”.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;{{rp|340}}

It is recommended that establishing safety begin in the pre-brief phase&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt; by alerting participants to the “basic assumption.” The basic assumption, derived from the [https://harvardmedsim.org/ Centre for Medical Simulation] at Harvard University (n.d.), is an agreed upon, predetermined mental model whereby everyone involved in the simulation &amp; debrief believe that all participants are intelligent, well-trained, want to do their best, and are participating to learn and promote development.&lt;ref name=Rudolph2008&gt;Rudolph, J., Simon, R., Raemer, D.B., &amp; Eppich, W. (2008). Debriefing as Formative Assessment: Closing Performance Gaps in Medical Education. ''Academic Emergency Medicine'', 15, 1010-1016. doi:10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00248.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; Additionally, Rudolph et al. (2014) have identified four principles to guide the formulation of a psychologically safe environment:
#	Communicate clear expectations
#	Establish a “fiction contract”
#	Attend to logistic details
#	Declare &amp; enact a commitment to respecting learners &amp; concern for their psychological safety&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;

Included in these principles is the notion of [[confidentiality]]. Explicitly reminding participants that their individual performance and debriefing reflections are not meant to be shared outside of the simulation event can help foster participation. Confidentiality builds trust by increasing transparency and allowing participants to practice without fear.&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rudolph2014 /&gt;

===Evidence &amp; Further Study===
There exists a paucity of quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of debriefing in medical simulation,&lt;ref name=Fanning2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raemer2011&gt;Raemer, D., Anderson, M., Cheng, A., Fanning, R., Nadkarni, V. &amp; Savoldelli, G. (2011). Research Regarding Debriefing as Part of the Learning Process. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 6, S52-S57. DOI: 10.1097/SIH.0b013e31822724d0&lt;/ref&gt; despite Lederman’s 1992 seminal Model for the Systematic Assessment of Debriefing.&lt;ref name=Lederman1992 /&gt; Nearly every article reviewed had a cry for objective studies regarding the effectiveness of debriefing, whether it be comparing: the myriad options of conversational structures,&lt;ref name=Sawyer2016 /&gt; debriefing models,&lt;ref name=Kolbe2013 /&gt;  or the comprehensive 5 W’s of Who – debriefer, What – content &amp; methods, When – timing, Where – environment, and Why – theory.&lt;ref name=Raemer2011 /&gt;

Currently, there are critical limitations in the presentation of existing studies, a sparsity of research related to debriefing topics of importance, and debriefing characteristics are incompletely reported.&lt;ref name=Raemer2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;  Recommendations for future debriefing studies include:
* Duration of debriefing
* Educator presence
* Educator characteristics
* Content of debriefing
* Structure &amp; method of debriefing
* Timing of debriefing&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt; 
and/or:
* Who: debriefer number &amp; characteristics
* What: the purpose of the debrief, formative vs summative assessment, individual vs team debriefing, method of debriefing, content covered, mechanics, etc.
* When: duration, post-event vs during-event vs delayed, etc.
* Where: in-situ, separate room, hospital, learning centre, etc.
* Why: theoretical underpinning of the debriefing model chosen &amp; rationale
* PICO: population, intervention, comparator, outcome&lt;ref name=Raemer2011 /&gt;

Current research has found that simulation training with debriefing, when compared with no intervention, had favourable, statistically significant effects for nearly all outcomes: knowledge, process skill, time skills, product skills, behaviour process, behaviour time, and patient effects. When compared with other forms of instruction, simulation and debriefing showed small favourable effects for knowledge, time &amp; process outcomes, and moderate effects for satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014 /&gt;

== Types of Simulations used in Medical Schools and Teaching Hospitals ==

There many different types of simulations that are used for training purposes. Some of the most known are the use of mannequins (referred to by the simulation company METI as Human Patient Simulators, or HPS for short) and standardized patients.

As seen in the chart titled "Types of Simulation Used in Medical Education" retrieved from the AAMC article, medical schools are leading the way when it comes to the use of standardized patients, but teaching hospitals and medical schools are close when it comes to full-scale mannequins and partial task trainers.

According to a study conducted by Bjorn Hoffman, to find the level of efficiency of simulation based medical training in a hi-tech health care setting, "simulation's ability to address skilful device handling as well as purposive aspects of technology provides a potential for effective and efficient learning."&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite web|title=Why simulation can be efficient: on the preconditions of efficient learning in complex technology based practices|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6920-9-48.pdf|website=BioMedCentral|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More positive information is found in the article entitled, "The role of medical simulation: an overview," by Kevin Kunler. Kunkler states that, "medical simulators can be useful tools in determining a physician's understanding and use of best practices, management of patient complications, appropriate use of instruments and tools, and overall competence in performing procedures."&lt;ref name=Kunkler&gt;{{cite web|title=The role of medical simulation: an overview|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rcs.101/pdf|website=WileyOnlineLibrary|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The main purpose of medical simulation is to properly educate students in various fields through the use of high technology simulators. According to the Institute of Medicine, 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually are recorded due primarily to medical mistakes during treatment.&lt;ref name="medicalMistakes"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Institute of Medicine (IOM)|title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System|year= 2000|url= http://www.nap.edu/books/0309068371/html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other statistics include:
* 225,000 deaths annually from medical error including 106,000 deaths due to "nonerror adverse events of medications"&lt;ref name="medicalMistakes2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Barbara |last=Starfield, MD, MPH|title=Is US Health Really the Best in the World?|website= jama.ama-assn.org|volume= 284, No. 4|date= July 26, 2000|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v284n4/ffull/jco00061.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7,391 deaths resulted from medication errors

If 44,000 to 98,000 deaths are the direct result of medical mistakes, and the CDC reported in 1999 that roughly 2.4 million people died in the United States, the medical mistakes estimate represents 1.8% to 4.0% of all deaths, respectively.&lt;ref name="wrongDiagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Common Are Medical Mistakes|year=2008|accessdate= November 30, 2008|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/mistakes/common.htm|website=wrongdiagnosis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A near 5% representation of deaths primarily related to medical mistakes is simply unacceptable in the world of medicine. Anything that can assist in bringing this number down is highly recommended and medical simulation has proven to be the key assistant.

===Advantages===
Studies have shown that students perform better and have higher retention rates than colleagues under strict traditional methods of medical training. The table below shows the results of tests given to 20 students using highly advanced medical simulation training materials and others given traditional paper based tests. It was found that high technology learning students outperformed traditional students significantly.&lt;ref name="studiesTable"&gt;Kincaid, Bala, et al. (2001), IST-TR-01-06.

In addition to overall better scores for medical students, several other distinct advantages exist not specifically related to training.
* Less costly
* Time efficient
* Less personnel required
* Many automated processes
* Ability to store performance history
* Track global statistics for many linked medical simulators
* Less medical related accidents

==Military and emergency response==
One of the single largest proponents behind simulators has always been the United States government. Billions (and perhaps trillions, at this point) of dollars have been spent in the name of advancing simulators for space exploration, computer advancements, medical and military training, and other projects funded for research by the government. The Department of Defense (most notably, the Army) is one of the largest fund producers for simulation research, training, and support. As such, most simulators tend to be created for military purposes including soldier, tank, and flight training in combat situations. In terms of medical simulation, military applications have played a large part in its success and funding. Some examples of scenarios useful for medical applications include casualty assessment, war trauma response, emergency evacuations, training for communications between teams, team/individual after action assessment, and scenario recreation from recorded data. Medical simulation of combat trauma through the use of [[moulage]] applied to soldiers, dummies or fake body parts to emulate casualties, helps to provide a realistic combat environment while having the benefit of lessening psychological trauma and PTSD when exposed to the real thing.

| &lt;center&gt;This network-based application, which is physiologically similar to the HPS, models and queues casualties to be treated when an HPS is available&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The Combat Trauma Patient Simulation Program is perhaps the largest in terms of processes and people involved at any given time. According to Kincaid, Donovan, and Pettitt, the CTPS program has been created in order to assess and analyze the feasibility of simulation in a battlefield environment.&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal"&gt;Kincaid, J.P., Donovan, J., &amp; Pettitt, B. (2003). Simulation Techniques for Training Emergency Response. International Journal of Emergency Management.&lt;/ref&gt; Combat casualties, massively destructive outbreaks, chemical spills, gas leaks, and other forms of large scale negative events can be accurately simulated in a safe, inexpensive, and relatively small environment.&lt;ref name="handsOnMedic"&gt;Jaganathan, B., Kincaid, J.P., &amp; Kimrey, S. (2002). Interoperable Surgical Simulation: Hands-on Medic Training for Common Battlefield Scenarios.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the rather large advantages to such a massive simulation of intertwining processes is the fact that people ranging from the field medics all the way up to the hospitals located in key military bases receive proper training for potential casualty prevention. The process of simulation begins with the Point of Injury and leads into Casualty Collection Points, Ground Medical Evacuations, Medical Aid Stations, and finally Hospitals.&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal" /&gt; Another advantage is that all casualties can be monitored through high-tech computer software and GPS receivers located in medical vehicles and in key medical clothing. By monitoring such data, leaders can be aware of which areas in the flow needs to be sped up, slowed down, moved to a different format, or removed completely. The flow between the Point of Injury and Hospital is required to be uninterrupted if a successful goal is to be met.

Live field exercises are another benefit of the CTPS program. By allowing many individuals to engage in a "live fire" simulation, people can become acquainted with the processes involved in transferring duties among teammates in order to keep the flow moving between locations. While there is the chance of these simulations not inspiring true dedication into the actions of some participants because it is not necessarily a real disaster, the truly dedicated individuals will shine in their ability to remedy the destruction. Leaders can spot weaknesses and strengths in the participants of the simulation without worrying about every single piece of the simulation. In a real disaster, leaders would need to concentrate on individual success, team success, and overall progression. Alternatively, in a simulation of exactly the same event, the leaders could ignore certain areas in order to concentrate on the individuals involved in order to analyze weaknesses.  Overall, the CTPS program is beneficial to everyone involved due to cost savings, risk reduction, personnel safety, enhanced effectiveness, and reduction of the learning curves.

CTPS contains many different technologies and smaller simulations within the rather gigantic "mother" simulation. Because the smaller simulations are potentially developed by separate companies (at times even competing companies), the interfaces have the high chance of being non-communicative or are simply incompatible without some sort of translation between the competing interfaces. All of this integration is made possible through a highly researched and deeply developed High Level Architecture containing interface modules to link up incompatible parts of the complete CTPS process.&lt;ref name="HLA"&gt;Petty, M. D., Windyga, P. S. (1999). A High Level Architecture-based Medical Simulation System. SIMULATION, 73, 281-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simulation federates (subsystems) of the CTPS involves the Lockheed Martin MILES system, the Operational Requirements-based Casualty Assessment system (ORCA), the Jackson Medical Simulation library (JMSL), and the Human Patient Simulator (HPS).&lt;ref name="emergencyJournal" /&gt; By combining these systems together, trainees can be contained to their respective areas of study while also studying the possible hindrances between stages of transition.

Beginning the military casualty treatment simulation is the MILES engagement simulator, which accurately simulates gunfire and other combat engagements.&lt;ref name="miles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miles Shootback Device (MSD)|year=2008|accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MILESShootbackDevice/index.html|website=lockheedmartin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES XXI) |year=2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MultipleIntegratedLaserEngagement/index.html |website=lockheedmartin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006114119/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/MultipleIntegratedLaserEngagement/index.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When trainees under the simulated engagement system fire upon each other and register virtual hits, the simulated casualties are moved to the next stage.&lt;ref name="miles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2" /&gt; At first glance, this system may seem similar to entertainment driven laser tag centers found within urban cities of the United States. But after a deeper look, the overall training that a user would go through involves much more than pointing, shooting, and laughing at the outcome. Proper combat procedures can be taught to single users, team based squads, or larger squads. Obvious advantages to this approach include reductions in physical harm to trainees, increase in physical realism by tagging individuals as "dead," and providing immediate feedback to users who score a hit. While the MILES training system is not necessarily a medically based simulation; however, it is completely necessary to begin the process into medical procedures. Without proper combat engagement, realistic casualties and injuries cannot be simulated and cannot be transferred into the beginning medical stages in a manner that would provide meaning to a medical trainee.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miles2" /&gt;

The next stage involves casualty assessment based on results driven by simulated engagements under the MILES system. Any and all casualties are transferred to the ORCA stage, given initial wound assessments, put into an initial medical state (severe, critical, dead), and finally passed on to the JMSL. Under the JMSL, all casualties generated by MILES and assessed initially by ORCA are sent through transition phases in order to accurately simulate a casualty progressing to a more and more deadly state while awaiting treatment under average circumstances.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;

After casualties have been generated, processed, and sent through various stages, actual training under a medic or doctor can be attained through the HPS. By using a physiologically realistic test dummy, users can treat a patient and receive immediate, accurate feedback regarding the results. Using this approach, users can engage in proper medical training as if a live patient was being used without subjecting the patient to physical harm in the case of accidents. From a financial standpoint, the entire system offers a cheaper alternative to throwing untrained medics into a potentially hazardous and live situation. On the job training simply does not cut it when it comes to lives and equipment on the line.&lt;ref name="HLA" /&gt;

===In the classroom===
There are many other medical systems that exist in forms other than "live fire" and "on the field" exercises. Simulation-Based Medical Education is one form that allows students to learn for educational purposes in a classroom. SBME works well with all forms of classroom learning such as lectures, problem solving, in hospital teaching, and other traditional forms of education.&lt;ref name="medEd"&gt;Ziv, A., Ben-David, S., &amp; Ziv, M. (2005). Simulation Based Medical Education: an opportunity to learn from errors. Medical Teacher, 27, 193-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Several advantages appear while using this approach such as patient safety, higher knowledge retaining, teamwork, competence, and skill at the bedside.

One of the most prominent versions of SBME that stands out is Adobe Flash based medical simulations and animations. While textbooks are sufficient for certain diagrams and process flow explanations, certain high quality animations created in Adobe Flash are extremely beneficial when it comes to learning. Some of the advantages to Flash-based medical simulations and animations include a visually animated representation of blood flow within a body or other physiological processes occurring within the body that would otherwise seem awkward or impossible to understand through static images. A rather annoying disadvantage to these animated approaches stems from the fact that they are extremely costly to create in terms of time and money. Some of the better animations require teams of people equal in size to major movie productions when it comes to after effects.

The newest progression of medical simulation, is the application of simulation to the medical operations, patient care and clinical sectors of medicine.  This evolution, can be seen with respect to the application of holographic simulation within the area of Virtual Health (VH), most known as telehealth with holographic simulation capability integrated into the delivery of healthcare through health information technologies to remote locations where medical care is not readily available.  As described earlier regarding medical simulation in general, the operational, patient care and clinical use of simulation will most likely travel the same road of acceptance and integration into the medical community.  Additional capabilities are expected to help drive this use of simulation to become common, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), and unmanned medical platforms. The recent introduction of virtual-reality surgical simulators is also gaining ground amongst high quality medical simulator tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Papagiannakis|first=George|title=Psychomotor Surgical Training in Virtual Reality|date=2018|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64177-5_41|work=The Adult Hip - Master Case Series and Techniques|pages=827–830|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319641751|access-date=2018-08-27|last2=Trahanias|first2=Panos|last3=Kenanidis|first3=Eustathios|last4=Tsiridis|first4=Eleftherios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2030">In [[open pit mining]] operations, people and equipment are constantly at the base of a steep, man-made slope (the highwall or pit-wall). Instances where this slope fails resulting in a rock or earthfall can result in loss of life, injuries and damage or destruction of equipment (see [[mining]]). It has been found that, over the last few hours preceding a slope failure, there is nearly always a small movement, or alteration in the movement pattern in the rock face of that section.

The system is intended to monitor mine slopes to detect this movement and generate a warning of impending failure ([[slope stability]]), so that personnel and equipment may be removed prior to the failure. The radar element provides very accurate, real-time, all weather slope movement measurements with sub millimetre detection ability, and is able to provide an alarm if the detected movement reaches a predetermined level, thereby permitting evacuation of the unstable area, and enhancing safety.

All radar measurements are fully geo-referenced to an accuracy that allows easy integration with standard digital terrain mapping (DTM) tools.

A second function of the Movement and Surveying Radar is to determine the absolute range to the electromagnetic reflective centroid of an area on a body of material or geographical feature. This functionality, combined with the accurately surveyed position of the measurement origin of the Movement and Surveying Radar and the positioning system’s angular measurement information, may be used to generate survey data of geographical features such as mine walls and rubble dumps. The survey data collected may be used for applications such as the calculation of material removal volumes.

A Movement and Surveying Radar combines simultaneously the execution of slope stability and surveying measurements, which together with high-speed external data links makes it a near real-time tool for mining safety, planning and productivity improvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57878">The '''nature versus nurture''' debate involves whether human behavior is determined by the environment, either [[prenatal development|prenatal]] or during a person's life, or [[behavioral genetics|by a person's genes]]. The alliterative expression "nature and nurture" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period&lt;ref&gt;In English at least since Shakespeare (''[[The Tempest]]'' 4.1: ''a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick'') and [[Richard Barnfield]] (''Nature and nurture once together met / The soule and shape in decent order set.''); in the 18th century used by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]] (''Roach v. Garvan'', "I appointed therefore the mother guardian, who is properly so by nature and nurture, where there is no testamentary guardian.")&lt;/ref&gt; and goes back to [[medieval French]].&lt;ref&gt;English usage is based on a tradition going back to medieval literature, where the opposition of ''nature'' ("instinct, inclination")  ''norreture'' ("culture, adopted mores") is a common motif, famously in [[Chretien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'', where the hero's effort to suppress his natural impulse of compassion in favor of what he considers proper courtly behavior leads to catastrophe. 
Lacy, Norris J. (1980) ''The Craft of Chrétien de Troyes: An Essay on Narrative Art'', Brill Archive, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GekUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of the two concepts as complementary is ancient ([[Classical Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἁπό φύσεως καὶ εὐτροφίας}}&lt;ref&gt;in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 351b; an opposition is made by Protagoras' character between ''art'' on one hand and ''constitution and fit nurture'' (nature and nurture) of the soul on the other, ''art'' (as well as ''rage and madness'';  ἀπὸ τέχνης  ἀπὸ θυμοῦ γε καὶ ἀπὸ μανίας) contributing to ''boldness'' (θάρσος), but ''nature and nurture'' combine to contribute to ''courage'' (ἀνδρεία). "Protagoras, in spite of the misgiving of Socrates, has no scruple in announcing himself a teacher of virtue, because virtue in the sense by him understood seems sufficiently secured by nature and nurture." Mackay, R. W.

Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors. Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g. the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplypsychology.org/naturevsnurture.html|title=Nature Nurture in Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase in its modern sense was popularized by the English Victorian polymath [[Francis Galton]], the modern founder of [[eugenics]] and [[behavioral genetics]], discussing the influence of [[heredity]] and &lt;!--social--&gt;environment on social advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227 |title=Proceedings, Volume 7 |publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain |date=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CCepY1AJYNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Nature+versus+nurture+galton&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=English Men of Science: Their Nature and Nurture|author= Francis Galton |publisher=  D.

The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from "nurture" was termed ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") by [[John Locke]] in 1690. A "blank slate view" in human developmental psychology assuming that human behavioral traits develop almost exclusively from environmental influences, was widely held during much of the 20th century (sometimes termed "blank-slatism").
The debate between "blank-slate" denial of the influence of heritability, and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits, has often been cast in terms of nature ''versus'' nurture. These two conflicting approaches to human development were at the core of an ideological dispute over research agendas throughout the second half of the 20th century. As both "nature" and "nurture" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an extricable manner, such views were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David S.

The strong dichotomy of nature ''versus'' nurture has thus been claimed to have limited relevance in some fields of research. Close [[feedback]] loops have been found in which "nature" and "nurture" influence one another constantly, as seen in [[self-domestication]]. In [[ecology]] and behavioral genetics, researchers think nurture has an essential influence on nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=August 2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=February 2016|subscription=yes |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in other fields, the dividing line between an inherited and an acquired trait becomes unclear, as in [[epigenetics]]&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=David S.|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25365 Edge.org: Nature Versus Nurture]. edge.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, Luci (January 24, 2014)  [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304302704579334954138196792 Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture], ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the debate==
[[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) is often cited as the foundational document of the "blank slate" view. Locke was criticizing [[René Descartes]]'s claim of an [[innate idea]] of [[God]] universal to humanity.
Locke's view was harshly criticized in his own time. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], complained that by denying the possibility of any innate ideas, 
Locke  "threw all order and virtue out of the world", leading to total [[moral relativism]].
Locke's was not the predominant view in the 19th century, which on the contrary tended to focus on "[[instinct]]".
Leda Cosmides and John Tooby noted that [[William James]] (1842–1910) argued that humans have ''more'' instincts than animals, and that greater freedom of action is the result of having more psychological instincts, not fewer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html Cosmides &amp; Tooby, Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer]. psych.ucsb.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "innate ideas" or "instincts" were of some importance in the discussion of [[free will]] in [[moral philosophy]]. In 18th-century philosophy, this was cast in terms of "innate ideas" establishing the presence of a universal virtue, prerequisite for objective morals. In the 20th century, this argument was in a way inverted, as some philosophers now argued that the evolutionary origins of human behavioral traits forces us to concede that there is no foundation for ethics ([[J. L. Mackie]]), while others treat ethics as a field in complete isolation from evolutionary considerations ([[Thomas Nagel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?ID=6008 |first=John |last=Mizonni |title=Ruse's Darwinian ethics and Moral Realism |publisher=Metanexus Institute |work=metanexus.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001133708/http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?id=6008 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, there was an increased interest in the role of the environment, as a reaction to the strong focus on pure heredity in the wake of the triumphal success of Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Hamilton (1978) ''The Triumph of Evolution:  The Heredity-Environment Controversy, 1900–1941'': 
"While it would be inaccurate to say that most American experimentalists concluded as the result of the general acceptance of Mendelism by 1910 or so that heredity was all powerful and environment of no consequence, it was nevertheless true that heredity occupied a much more prominent place than environment in their writings."&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[social sciences]] developed as the project of studying the influence of culture in clean isolation from questions related to "biology".
[[Franz Boas]]'s  ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]'' (1911) established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another.

The tool of [[twin study|twin studies]] was developed as a research design intended to exclude all confounders based on [[behavioural genetics|inherited behavioral traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rende|first=R. D.|last2=Plomin|first2=R.|last3=Vandenberg|first3=S. G.|date=March 1990|title=Who discovered the twin method?|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=277–285|issn=0001-8244|pmid=2191648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies are designed to decompose the variability of a given trait in a given population into a genetic and an environmental component.

[[John B. Watson]] in the 1920s and 1930s established the school of purist [[behaviorism]] that would become dominant over the following decades. Watson is often said to have been convinced of the complete dominance of cultural influence over anything that heredity might contribute, based on the following quote which is frequently repeated without context:
:"Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select – doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I admit it, but so have the advocates of the contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of years"  (''Behaviorism'', 1930, p. 82).

The last sentence of the above quote is frequently omitted, leading to confusion about Watson's position. 

During the 1940s to 1960s, [[Ashley Montagu]] was a notable proponent of this purist form of behaviorism which allowed no contribution from heredity whatsoever: 

:"Man is man because he has no instincts, because everything he is and has become he has learned, acquired, from his culture ... with the exception of the instinctoid reactions in infants to sudden withdrawals of support and to sudden loud noises, the human being is entirely instinctless."&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Aggression'' (1968) cited after Pinker, Steven (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', Penguin, New York, {{ISBN|1501264338}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Calvin Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C. S. (1951) "The Genetics of Behavior", pp. 304–329 in ''Handbook of Experimental Psychology'', S. S. Stevens (Ed.), New York, NY, USA: John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the dichotomy opposing nature to nurture is ultimately fruitless.

[[Robert Ardrey]] in the 1960s argued for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning [[territoriality]], in the widely read ''African Genesis'' (1961) and ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''. [[Desmond Morris]] in ''[[The Naked Ape]]''  (1967) expressed similar views.
Organised opposition to Montagu's kind of purist "blank-slatism" began to pick up in the 1970s, notably led by [[E. O. Wilson]] (''[[On Human Nature]]'' 1979).
Twin studies established that there was, in many cases, a significant heritable component. 
These results did not in any way point to overwhelming contribution of heritable factors, with heritability typically ranging around 40% to 50%, so that the controversy may not be cast in terms of purist behaviorism vs. purist nativism. Rather, it was purist behaviorism which was gradually replaced by the now-predominant view that both kinds of factors usually contribute to a given trait, anecdotally phrased by [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] as an answer to the question  "which, nature or nurture, contributes more to personality?" by asking in response, "Which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?"&lt;ref&gt;Meaney M. (2004) "The nature of nurture: maternal effects and chromatin remodelling", in ''Essays in Social Neuroscience'', Cacioppo, J. T. &amp; Berntson, G. G. (eds.) MIT press. {{ISBN|0-262-03323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a comparable avenue of research,  anthropologist Donald Brown in the 1980s surveyed hundreds of anthropological studies from around the world and collected a set of [[cultural universals]]. He identified approximately 150 such features, coming to the conclusion there is indeed a "universal human nature", and that these features point to what that universal human nature is.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker (2002), pp. 435–439.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the controversy, during the 1970s to 1980s, the debate was highly ideologised. In ''[[Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature]]'' (1984), [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] criticise "[[genetic determinism]]" from a [[Marxist]] framework, arguing that "Science is the ultimate legitimator of bourgeois ideology ... If [[biological determinism]] is a weapon in the struggle between classes, then the universities are weapons factories, and their teaching and research faculties are the engineers, designers, and production workers." The debate thus shifted away from whether heritable traits exist to whether it was politically or ethically permissible to admit their existence. The authors deny this, requesting that evolutionary inclinations be discarded in ethical and political discussions regardless of whether they exist or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2008) ''The Brighter Side of Human Nature''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|078672465X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritability studies became much easier to perform, and hence much more numerous, with the advances of genetic studies during the 1990s. By the late 1990s, an overwhelming amount of evidence had accumulated that amounts to a refutation of the extreme forms of "blank-slatism" advocated by Watson or Montagu.

This revised state of affairs was summarized in books aimed at a popular audience from the late 1990s. In ''[[The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do]]'' (1998), [[Judith Rich Harris]] was heralded by [[Steven Pinker]] as a book that "will come to be seen as a turning point in the [[history of psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, Judith Rich |title=The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do, Revised and Updated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uKBJRMJBjcC&amp;pg=PR21|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0165-0|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but Harris was criticized for exaggerating the point of "parental upbringing seems to matter less than previously thought" to the implication that "parents do not matter".&lt;ref&gt;A position not actually taken by the author, but apparently it was feared that "lay readers" would still interpret the book in this way, as in  "Will it free some to mistreat their kids, since 'it doesn't matter'?", with this fear being attributed to "psychologist Frank Farley of Temple University, president of the APA division that honored Harris" by {{cite news |last=Begley |first=Sharon |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/newsweek/parent090798a.htm |title=The Parent Trap |newspaper=Newsweek |date=1998-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation as it presented itself by the end of the 20th century was summarized in ''[[The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]'' (2002) by [[Steven Pinker]]. The book became a best-seller, and was instrumental in bringing to the attention of a wider public the paradigm shift away from the behaviourist purism of the 1940s to 1970s that had taken place over the preceding decades. Pinker portrays the adherence to pure blank-slatism as an ideological [[dogma]] linked to two other dogmas found in the dominant view of human nature in the 20th century, which he termed "[[noble savage]]" (in the sense that people are born good and corrupted by bad influence) and 
"[[ghost in the machine]]"  (in the sense that there is a human soul capable of moral choices completely detached from biology). Pinker argues that all three dogmas were held onto for an extended period even in the face of evidence because they were seen as ''desirable'' in the sense that if any human trait is purely conditioned by culture, any undesired trait (such as crime or aggression) may be engineered away by purely cultural (political means). Pinker focuses on reasons he assumes were responsible for unduly repressing evidence to the contrary, notably the fear of (imagined or projected) political or ideological consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability estimates==
{{main|Heritability}}
[[File:Sibling-correlation-422.png|422px|thumb|right|This chart illustrates three patterns one might see when studying the influence of genes and environment on traits in individuals. Trait A shows a high sibling correlation, but little heritability (i.e. high shared environmental variance ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; low heritability ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Trait B shows a high heritability since correlation of trait rises sharply with the degree of genetic similarity. Trait C shows low heritability, but also low correlations generally; this means Trait C has a high nonshared environmental variance ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the degree to which individuals display Trait C has little to do with either genes or broadly predictable environmental factors—roughly, the outcome approaches random for an individual. Notice also that even identical twins raised in a common family rarely show 100% trait correlation.]]

It is important to note that the term ''heritability'' refers only to the degree of genetic variation between people on a trait.  It does not refer to the degree to which a trait of a particular individual is due to environmental or genetic factors. The traits of an individual are always a complex interweaving of both.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate&gt;Pinker, Steven (September 30, 2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''.  Viking; 1st edition. {{ISBN|978-0670031511}}. [http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616s.pdf Lay summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226054452/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616S.pdf |date=2014-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual, even strongly genetically influenced, or "obligate" traits, such as eye color, assume the inputs of a typical environment during ontogenetic development (e.g., certain ranges of temperatures, oxygen levels, etc.).

In contrast, the "heritability index" statistically quantifies the extent to which variation ''between individuals'' on a trait is due to variation in the genes those individuals carry. In animals where breeding and environments can be controlled experimentally, heritability can be determined relatively easily. Such experiments would be unethical for human research. This problem can be overcome by finding existing populations of humans that reflect the experimental setting the researcher wishes to create.

One way to determine the contribution of genes and environment to a trait is to [[twin study|study twins]]. In one kind of study, [[identical twins]] reared apart are compared to randomly selected pairs of people. The twins share identical genes, but different family environments. In another kind of twin study, identical twins reared together (who share family environment and genes) are compared to [[fraternal twins]] reared together (who also share family environment but only share half their genes). Another condition that permits the disassociation of genes and environment is [[adoption]]. In one kind of [[adoption study]], biological siblings reared together (who share the same family environment and half their genes) are compared to adoptive siblings (who share their family environment but none of their genes).

In many cases, it has been found that genes make a substantial contribution, including psychological traits such as intelligence and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neill, J. T. |year=2004 |url=http://www.wilderdom.com/personality/L4-1IntelligenceNatureVsNurture.html |title=Nature vs Nurture in Intelligence |website=wilderdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet heritability may differ in other circumstances, for instance environmental deprivation. Examples of low, medium, and high heritability traits include:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
!Low heritability!!Medium heritability!!High heritability
|-
|align=center|Specific language||align=center|Weight||align=center|Blood type
|-
|align=center|Specific religion||align=center|Religiosity||align=center|Eye color
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Twin and adoption studies have their methodological limits.  For example, both are limited to the range of environments and genes which they sample.  Almost all of these studies are conducted in Western, first-world countries, and therefore cannot be extrapolated globally to include poorer, non-western populations.  Additionally, both types of studies depend on particular assumptions, such as the [[equal environments assumption]] in the case of twin studies, and the lack of pre-adoptive effects in the case of adoption studies.

Since the definition of "nature" in this context is tied to "heritability", the definition of "nurture" has necessarily become very wide, including any type of causality that is not heritable. The term has thus moved away from its original connotation of "cultural influences" to include all effects of the environment, including; indeed, a substantial source of environmental input to [[human nature]] may arise from stochastic variations in prenatal development and is thus in no sense of the term "cultural".&lt;ref name="pmid9331275"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rice D.

==Interaction of genes and environment==
{{main|Gene–environment interaction}}
{{off topic|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--this page should be about the history of the "nature vs. nurture" debate, not on current or emerging views of this related but very specific sub-topic--&gt;
{{rquote|right|Many properties of the brain are genetically organized, and don't depend on information coming in from the senses.|[[Steven Pinker]]}}
Heritability refers to the origins of differences between people. Individual development, even of highly heritable traits, such as eye color, depends on a range of environmental factors, from the other genes in the organism, to physical variables such as temperature, oxygen levels etc. during its development or ontogenesis.

The variability of trait can be meaningfully spoken of as being due in certain proportions to genetic differences ("nature"), or environments ("nurture"). For highly [[wikt:penetrant|penetrant]] [[Mendelian]] genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]] virtually all the incidence of the disease is due to genetic differences. Huntington's animal models live much longer or shorter lives depending on how they are cared for {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

At the other extreme, traits such as [[native language]] are environmentally determined: linguists have found that any child (if capable of learning a language at all) can learn any human language with equal facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|title=Language, its nature, development, and origin|year=1922|publisher=H. Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; With virtually all biological and psychological traits, however, genes and environment work in concert, communicating back and forth to create the individual.

At a molecular level, genes interact with signals from other genes and from the environment. While there are many thousands of single-gene-locus traits, so-called [[complex traits]] are due to the additive effects of many (often hundreds) of small gene effects. A good example of this is height, where variance appears to be spread across many hundreds of loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ng.608 |pmid=20562875 |title=Common SNPs explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=565–9 |year=2010 |last1=Yang |first1=Jian |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=McEvoy |first3=Brian P |last4=Gordon |first4=Scott |last5=Henders |first5=Anjali K |last6=Nyholt |first6=Dale R |last7=Madden |first7=Pamela A |last8=Heath |first8=Andrew C |last9=Martin |first9=Nicholas G |last10=Montgomery |first10=Grant W |last11=Goddard |first11=Michael E |last12=Visscher |first12=Peter M |pmc=3232052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme genetic or environmental conditions can predominate in rare circumstances—if a child is born mute due to a genetic mutation, it will not learn to speak any language regardless of the environment; similarly, someone who is practically certain to eventually develop Huntington's disease according to their genotype may die in an unrelated accident (an environmental event) long before the disease will manifest itself.

[[Steven Pinker]] likewise described several examples:&lt;ref&gt;[https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3600799/pinker_whynature.pdf?sequence=2 Why nature &amp; nurture won't go away. Harvard Online PDF Pinker, Steven. 2004. Why nature &amp; nurture won't go away.

:concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by the home or culture—which language one speaks, which religion one practices, which political party one supports—are not heritable at all. But traits that reflect the underlying talents and temperaments—how proficient with language a person is, how religious, how liberal or conservative—are partially heritable.

When traits are determined by a complex interaction of [[genotype]] and environment it is possible to measure the [[heritability]] of a trait within a population. However, many non-scientists who encounter a report of a trait having a certain percentage heritability imagine non-interactional, additive contributions of genes and environment to the trait. As an analogy, some laypeople may think of the degree of a trait being made up of two "buckets," genes and environment, each able to hold a certain capacity of the trait. But even for intermediate heritabilities, a trait is always shaped by both genetic dispositions and the environments in which people develop, merely with greater and lesser plasticities associated with these heritability measures.

Heritability measures always refer to the degree of ''variation between individuals in a population''. That is, as these statistics cannot be applied at the level of the individual, it would be incorrect to say that while the heritability index of personality is about 0.6, 60% of one's personality is obtained from one's parents and 40% from the environment. To help to understand this, imagine that all humans were genetic clones. The heritability index for all traits would be zero (all variability between clonal individuals must be due to environmental factors). And, contrary to erroneous interpretations of the heritability index, as societies become more egalitarian (everyone has more similar experiences) the heritability index goes up (as environments become more similar, variability between individuals is due more to genetic factors).

One should also take into account the fact that the variables of heritability and environmentality are not precise and vary within a chosen population and across cultures. It would be more accurate to state that the degree of heritability and environmentality is measured in its reference to a particular phenotype in a chosen group of a population in a given period of time. The accuracy of the calculations is further hindered by the number of coefficients taken into consideration, age being one such variable. The display of the influence of heritability and environmentality differs drastically across age groups: the older the studied age is, the more noticeable the heritability factor becomes, the younger the test subjects are, the more likely it is to show signs of strong influence of the environmental factors.

Some have pointed out that environmental inputs affect the expression of genes&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; (see the article on [[epigenetics]]). This is one explanation of how environment can influence the extent to which a genetic disposition will actually manifest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The interactions of genes with environment, called [[gene–environment interaction]]s, are another component of the nature–nurture debate. A classic example of gene–environment interaction is the ability of a diet low in the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] to partially suppress the genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]]. Yet another complication to the nature–nurture debate is the existence of [[gene–environment correlation]]s. These correlations indicate that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to find themselves in certain environments. Thus, it appears that genes can shape (the selection or creation of) environments. Even using experiments like those described above, it can be very difficult to determine convincingly the relative contribution of genes and environment.

A study conducted by T. J. Bouchard, Jr. showed data that has been evidence for the importance of genes when testing middle-aged twins reared together and reared apart. The results shown have been important evidence against the importance of environment when determining, happiness, for example. In the Minnesota study of twins reared apart, it was actually found that there was higher correlation for monozygotic twins reared apart (0.52)than monozygotic twins reared together (0.44). Also, highlighting the importance of genes, these correlations found much higher correlation among monozygotic than dizygotic twins that had a correlation of 0.08 when reared together and −0.02 when reared apart.&lt;ref name=lykken1996&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/courses/psyc5112/Readings/psnHappiness_Lykken.pdf|title=Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=186–189|year=1996|last1=Lykken|first1=David|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social pre-wiring===
{{One source section|date=December 2017}}
'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

===Obligate vs. facultative adaptations===
Traits may be considered to be adaptations (such as the umbilical cord), byproducts of adaptations (the belly button) or due to random variation (convex or concave belly button shape).&lt;ref name=Buss2011/&gt;
An alternative to contrasting nature and nurture focuses on  "obligate vs. facultative" adaptations.&lt;ref name=Buss2011&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind (4 ed.). New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations may be generally more obligate (robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or more facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).  For example, the rewarding sweet taste of sugar and the pain of bodily injury are obligate psychological adaptations—typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation.&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, facultative adaptations are somewhat like "if-then" statements.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, K. (2013).  [http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-heritability.html Explainer: What is Heritability?].  MedicalXpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a facultative psychological adaptation may be adult [[attachment style]]. The attachment style of adults, (for example, a "secure attachment style," the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others) is proposed to be conditional on whether an individual's early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. An example of a facultative physiological adaptation is tanning of skin on exposure to sunlight (to prevent skin damage). Facultative social adaptation have also been proposed. For example, whether a society is warlike or peaceful has been proposed to be conditional on how much collective threat that society is experiencing &lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Advanced techniques===

Quantitative studies of heritable traits throw light on the question.

Developmental genetic analysis examines the effects of genes over the course of a human lifespan. Early studies of intelligence, which mostly examined young children, found that [[heritability]] measured 40–50%. Subsequent developmental genetic analyses found that variance attributable to additive environmental effects is less apparent in older individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=R. |last2=Spinath |first2=F. M. |year=2004 |title=Intelligence: genetics, genes, and genomics |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=112–129 |pmid=14717631 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGue, M.; Bouchard Jr., T. J.; Iacono, W. G. and Lykken, D. T. (1993) "Behavioral Genetics of Cognitive Ability: A Life-Span Perspective", in ''Nature, Nurture, and Psychology'', by R. Plomin &amp; G. E. McClearn (Eds.)

Multivariate genetic analysis examines the genetic contribution to several traits that vary together. For example, multivariate genetic analysis has demonstrated that the genetic determinants of all specific cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed) overlap greatly, such that the genes associated with any specific cognitive ability will affect all others. Similarly, multivariate genetic analysis has found that genes that affect scholastic achievement completely overlap with the genes that affect cognitive ability.

Extremes analysis examines the link between normal and pathological traits. For example, it is hypothesized that a given behavioral disorder may represent an extreme of a continuous distribution of a normal behavior and hence an extreme of a continuous distribution of genetic and environmental variation. Depression, phobias, and reading disabilities have been examined in this context.

For a few highly heritable traits, studies have identified loci associated with variance in that trait, for instance in some individuals with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Owen | first2 = M. J. | year = 2003 | title = Genes for schizophrenia?

===Entrepreneurship===
Through studies of identical twins separated at birth, one-third of their creative thinking abilities come from genetics and two-thirds come from learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Jeffrey H., Hal B. Gregersen, and Clayton M. Christensen. (2009). Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that between 37 and 42 percent of the explained variance can be attributed to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.07.002|title=The genetic basis of entrepreneurship: Effects of gender and personality|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=110|issue=2|pages=93–107|year=2009|last1=Zhang|first1=Zhen|last2=Zyphur|first2=Michael J.|last3=Narayanan|first3=Jayanth|last4=Arvey|first4=Richard D.|last5=Chaturvedi|first5=Sankalp|last6=Avolio|first6=Bruce J.|last7=Lichtenstein|first7=Paul|last8=Larsson|first8=Gerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning primarily comes in the form of human capital transfers of entrepreneurial skills through parental role modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist, Matthew J., Sol, Joeri and Van Praag, Mirjam. (2012). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2119047 Why Do Entrepreneurial Parents Have Entrepreneurial Children?] Institute for the Study of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other findings agree that the key to innovative entrepreneurial success comes from environmental factors and working “10,000 hours” to gain mastery in entrepreneurial skills.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. (2008) ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]]''. Little, Brown and Company. {{ISBN|978-0316017923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability of intelligence==
{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}
Evidence from [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] research suggests that family environmental factors may have an effect upon childhood [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. The American Psychological Association's report "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]" (1995) states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Here, environment is playing a role in what is believed to be fully genetic (intelligence) but it was found that severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments have highly negative effects on many aspects of children's intellect development. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. On the other hand, by late adolescence this correlation disappears, such that adoptive siblings no longer have similar IQ scores.&lt;ref name=Plomin2008&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., McClearn, G. E., &amp; McGuffn, P. (2008). ''Behavioral Genetics'' (5th edition). New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1429205771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, adoption studies indicate that, by adulthood, adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.74), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41465638|pmid=9549239|year=1998|author1=Bouchard Jr|first1=T. J.|title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities|journal=Human Biology|volume=70|issue=2|pages=257–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent adoption studies also found that supportive parents can have a positive effect on the development of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.89.2.381|title=Same-age unrelated siblings: A unique test of within-family environmental influences on IQ similarity|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=381–390|year=1997|last1=Segal|first1=Nancy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality traits==
{{Main|Personality psychology#Genetic basis of personality}}
[[Personality]] is a frequently cited example of a heritable trait that has been studied in twins and adoptees using [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] study designs. The most famous categorical organization of heritable personality traits were created by Goldberg (1990) in which he had college students rate their personalities on 1400 dimensions to begin, and then narrowed these down into "[[Big Five personality traits|''The Big Five'']]" factors of personality—Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The close genetic relationship between positive personality traits and, for example, our happiness traits are the mirror images of comorbidity in psychopathology. These personality factors were consistent across cultures, and many studies have also tested the heritability of these traits.

Identical twins reared apart are far more similar in personality than randomly selected pairs of people. Likewise, identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. Also, biological siblings are more similar in personality than adoptive siblings. Each observation suggests that personality is heritable to a certain extent. A supporting article had focused on the heritability of personality (which is estimated to be around 50% for subjective well-being) in which a study was conducted using a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the heritable differences in subjective well-being which were found to be fully accounted for by the genetic model of the Five-Factor Model’s personality domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Weiss A., Bates T. C., Luciano M. |title=Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal=[[Psychological Science]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=205–10 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18315789 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18315789 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same study designs allow for the examination of environment as well as genes.

Adoption studies also directly measure the strength of shared family effects. Adopted siblings share only family environment.  Most adoption studies indicate that by adulthood the personalities of adopted siblings are little or no more similar than random pairs of strangers.  This would mean that shared family effects on personality are zero by adulthood.

In the case of personality traits, non-shared environmental effects are often found to out-weigh shared environmental effects. That is, environmental effects that are typically thought to be life-shaping (such as family life) may have less of an impact than non-shared effects, which are harder to identify. One possible source of non-shared effects is the environment of pre-natal development. Random variations in the genetic program of development may be a substantial source of non-shared environment. These results suggest that "nurture" may not be the predominant factor in "environment". Environment and our situations, do in fact impact our lives, but not the way in which we would typically react to these environmental factors. We are preset with personality traits that are the basis for how we would react to situations. An example would be how extraverted prisoners become less happy than introverted prisoners and would react to their incarceration more negatively due to their preset extraverted personality.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate/&gt;{{rp|Ch 19}} Behavioral genes are somewhat proven to exist when we take a look at fraternal twins. When fraternal twins are reared apart, they show the same similarities in behavior and response as if they have been reared together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://explorable.com/nature-vs-nurture-debate|title=Nature and Nurture Debate - Genes or Environment?|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==

===Genomics===
{{main|Genomics}}
The relationship between personality and people's own well-being is influenced and mediated by genes (Weiss, Bates, &amp; Luciano, 2008). There has been found to be a stable set point for happiness that is characteristic of the individual (largely determined by the individual's genes). Happiness fluctuates around that setpoint (again, genetically determined) based on whether good things or bad things are happening to us ("nurture"), but only fluctuates in small magnitude in a normal human. The midpoint of these fluctuations is determined by the "great genetic lottery" that people are born with, which leads them to conclude that how happy they may feel at the moment or over time is simply due to the luck of the draw, or gene. This fluctuation was also not due to educational attainment, which only accounted for less than 2% of the variance in well-being for women, and less than 1% of the variance for men.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt;

They consider that the individualities measured together with personality tests remain steady throughout an individual’s lifespan. They further believe that human beings may refine their forms or personality but can never change them entirely. Darwin's Theory of Evolution steered naturalists such as George Williams and William Hamilton to the concept of personality evolution. They suggested that physical organs and also personality is a product of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herschkowitz, Herschkowitz, &amp; Kagan|first1=Norbert, M. &amp; Kagan|title=A Good Start In Life|date=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[genomic sequencing]], it has become possible to search for and identify specific gene polymorphisms that affect traits such as IQ and personality. These techniques work by tracking the association of differences in a trait of interest with differences in specific molecular markers or functional variants. An example of a visible human trait for which the precise genetic basis of differences are relatively well known is [[eye color]]. For traits with many genes affecting the outcome, a smaller portion of the variance is currently understood: For instance for height known gene variants account for around 5–10% of height variance at present.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
When discussing the significant role of genetic heritability in relation to one's level of happiness, it has been found that from 44% to 52% of the variance in one's well-being is associated with genetic variation. Based on the retest of smaller samples of twins studies after 4,5, and 10 years, it is estimated that the heritability of the genetic stable component of subjective well-being approaches 80%.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt; Other studies that have found that genes are a large influence in the variance found in happiness measures, exactly around 35–50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005374|pmid=16219116|title=Heritability of life satisfaction in adults: A twin-family study|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1581|year=2005|last1=Stubbe|first1=J.

In contrast to views developed in 1960s that gender identity is primarily learned (which led to policy-based surgical sex changed in children such as [[David Reimer]]), genomics has provided solid evidence that both sex and gender identities are primarily influenced by genes:

{{Quote|text=It is now clear that genes are vastly more influential than virtually any other force in shaping sex identity and gender identity…[T]he growing consensus in medicine is that…children should be assigned to their chromosomal (i.e., genetic) sex regardless of anatomical variations and differences—with the option of switching, if desired, later in life.|sign=[[Siddhartha Mukherjee]]|source=The Gene: An Intimate History}}

=== Linkage and association studies ===
In their attempts to locate the genes responsible for configuring certain phenotypes, researches resort to two different techniques.
Linkage study facilitates the process of determining a specific location in which a gene of interest is located. This methodology is applied only among individuals that are related and does not serve to pinpoint specific genes. It does, however, narrow down the area of search, making it easier to locate one or several genes in the genome which constitute a specific trait.

Association studies, on the other hand, are more hypothetic and seek to verify whether a particular genetic variable really influences the phenotype of interest. In association studies it is more common to use case-control approach, comparing the subject with relatively higher or lower hereditary determinants with the control subject.

Neochromosomes have also been created using [[genetic engineering]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature.2014.14941| title = First synthetic yeast chromosome revealed| journal = Nature| year = 2014| last1 = Callaway | first1 = E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/gene-gurus-create-synthetic-yeast-chromosome-scratch-n63316|title=Gene Gurus Create Synthetic Yeast Chromosome From Scratch|author=Alan Boyle|publisher=NBC News|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancer-associated neochromosomes ==

Cancer-associated neochromosomes are giant supernumerary chromosomes. They harbor the mutations that drive certain cancers (highly amplified copies of key [[oncogene]]s, such as [[Mdm2|MDM2]], [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]], [[HMGA2]]). They may be circular or linear chromosomes. They have functional [[centromere]]s, and [[telomere]]s when linear. They are rare overall, being found in about 3% of cancers, but are common in certain rare cancers. For example, they are found in 90% of parosteal [[osteosarcomas]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Neochromosomes from well- and de-differentiated [[liposarcoma]] have been studied at high resolution by isolation (using flow sorting) and sequencing, as well as microscopy. They consist of hundreds of fragments of DNA, often derived from multiple normal chromosomes, stitched together randomly, and contain high levels of DNA amplification (~30-60 copies of some genes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Using [[statistical inference]] and [[mathematical model]]ling, the process of how neochromosomes initially form and evolve has been made clearer. Fragments of DNA, produced following [[chromothripsis|chromothriptic]] shattering of [[Chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] undergo [[DNA repair]] to form of a circular or [[ring chromosome]]. This undergoes hundreds of circular [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle]]s, causing random amplification and deletion of DNA with selection for the amplification of key oncogenes. DNA from additional chromosomes is somehow added during this process. Erosion of [[centromere]]s can lead to the formation of [[neocentromere]]s or the capture of new native centromeres from other chromosomes. The process ends when the neochromosome forms a linear chromosome following the capture of telomeric caps, which can be chromothriptically derived.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28687">In [[business]] and [[engineering]], '''new product development''' ('''NPD''') covers the complete process of bringing a new [[product (business)|product]] to market. A central aspect of NPD is [[product design]], along with various business considerations. New product development is described broadly as the transformation of a [[market opportunity]] into a product available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277068142|title=A dictionary of business and management.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199234899|edition=5th|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=277068142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product can be tangible (something physical which one can touch) or intangible (like a [[service (disambiguation)|service]], [[user experience|experience]], or [[belief (disambiguation)|belief]]), though sometimes services and other processes are distinguished from "products." NPD requires an understanding of customer needs and wants, the competitive environment, and the nature of the market.&lt;ref&gt;

Cost, time and quality are the main variables that drive customer needs. Aiming at these three variables, [[company|companies]] develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy [[customer requirement]]s and to increase their own [[market share]] by a regular development of new products.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} There are many uncertainties and challenges which companies must face throughout the process. The use of [[best practice]]s and the elimination of barriers to communication are the main concerns for the [[management]] of the NPD .{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Process structure ==
The product development process typically consists of several activities that firms employ in the complex process of delivering new products to the market. A [[process management]] approach is used to provide a structure. Product development often overlaps much with the [[engineering design]] process, particularly if the new product being developed involves application of math and/or science. Every new product will pass through a series of stages/phases, including [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] among other aspects of [[design]], as well as [[manufacturing]] and market introduction.  In highly complex engineered products (e.g. aircraft, automotive, machinery), the NPD process can be likewise complex regarding management of personnel, milestones and deliverables.  Such projects typically use an [[integrated product team]] approach.  The process for managing large-scale complex engineering products is much slower (often 10-plus years) than that deployed for many types of consumer goods.

The product development process is articulated and broken down in many different ways, many of which often include the following phases/stages:
#  '''Fuzzy front-end''' (FFE) is the set of activities employed before the more formal and well defined [[requirements engineering|requirements specification]] is completed.  [[Requirements]] speak to what the product should do or have, at varying degrees of specificity, in order to meet the perceived market or business need.
#  '''Product design''' is the development of both the [[High-level design|high-level]] and [[Detailed design document|detailed-level]] design of the product:  which turns the ''what'' of the requirements into a specific ''how'' this particular product will meet those requirements. This typically has the most overlap with the [[engineering design]] process, but can also include [[industrial design]] and even purely aesthetic aspects of design. On the marketing and planning side, this phase ends at pre-commercialization analysis{{clarify|date=April 2015}} stage.
#  '''Product implementation''' often refers to later stages of detailed engineering design (e.g. refining mechanical or electrical hardware, or software, or [[consumer good|goods]] or other product forms), as well as [[verification and validation|test process]] that may be used to validate that the prototype actually meets all design specifications that were established.
#  '''Fuzzy back-end''' or commercialization phase represent the action steps where the [[manufacturing|production]] and market launch occur.

The front-end marketing phases have been very well researched, with valuable models proposed. Peter Koen et al. provides a five-step front-end activity called front-end innovation: opportunity identification, opportunity analysis, idea genesis, idea selection, and idea and technology development. He also includes an engine in the middle of the five front-end stages and the possible outside barriers that can influence the process outcome. The engine represents the management driving the activities described. The front end of the innovation is the greatest area of weakness in the NPD process. This is mainly because the FFE is often chaotic, unpredictable and unstructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koen|first1=Peter A.|title=The fuzzy front-end for incremental, breakthrough and platform products and services|accessdate=February 5, 2017|issue=1|publisher=Consortium for corporate entrepreneurship|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32151604/FuzzyFrontEnd_Old.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1486329441&amp;Signature=8XPQsXKa5HC7W0UjVcloWV6Qp0Q%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D1_Fuzzy_Front_End_Effective_Methods_Tool.pdf}} {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Engineering design is the process whereby a technical solution is developed iteratively to solve a given problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=P. Robert|last2=Eppinger|first2=P. Steven|title=Identifying controlling features of engineering design iteration|journal=Management Science|date=1997|volume=43|issue=3|pages=276–293|doi=10.1287/mnsc.43.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Yassine, Ali; Braha, Dan (2003),[http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf "Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach."] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications, '''11''' (3):165–177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, Ali; Joglekar, Nitin; Braha, Dan; Eppinger, Steven; Whitney, Daniel (2003),"Information hiding in product development: the design churn effect." Research in Engineering Design, '''14''' (3): 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt;
The design stage is very important because at this stage most of the product life cycle costs are engaged. Previous research shows that 70–80% of the final product quality and 70% of the product entire life-cycle cost are determined in the product design phase, therefore the design-manufacturing interface represent the greatest opportunity for cost reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan-mei|first1=Zhou|title=Cost-benefit of interface management improvement in design-manufacturing chain|journal=Chinese academy of science and technology management|date=2009|volume=14|issue=3|pages=380–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Design projects last from a few weeks to three years with an average of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hargadon|first1=Andrew|title=Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1997|volume=42|issue=4|pages=716–749|doi=10.2307/2393655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and Commercialization phases usually start a very early collaboration. When the concept design is finished it will be sent to manufacturing plant for prototyping, developing a Concurrent Engineering approach by implementing practices such as [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], [[Design for manufacturability|DFM]]/[[Design for assembly|DFA]] and more.
The output of the design (engineering) is a set of product and process specifications – mostly in the form of drawings, and the output of manufacturing is the product ready for sale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=S. Paul|title=Interdepartmental interdependence and coordination: the case of the design/manufacturing interface|journal=Organisation Science|date=1995|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–167|doi=10.1287/orsc.6.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, the design team will develop drawings with technical specifications representing the future product, and will send it to the manufacturing plant to be executed. Solving product/process fit problems is of high priority in information communication design because 90% of the development effort must be scrapped if any changes are made after the release to manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== NPD Process ==

#'''New Product Strategy''' – Innovators have clearly defined their goals and objectives for the new product.
#'''Idea Generation''' – Collective brainstorming through internal and external sources.
#'''Screening''' – Condense the number of brainstormed ideas.
#'''Concept Testing''' – Structure an idea into a detailed concept.
#'''Business Analysis''' – Understand the cost and profits of the new product and determining if they meet company objectives.
#'''Product Development''' – Developing the product.
#'''Market Testing''' – Marketing mix is tested through a trial run of the product.
#'''Commercialization''' – Introducing the product to the public.

==Models==
Conceptual models have been designed in order to facilitate a smooth process. The concept adopted by IDEO, a successful design and consulting firm, is one of the most researched processes in regard to new product development and is a five-step procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moen|first1=Ron|title=A review of the IDEO process|website=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/web-assets/2001/10/a-review-of-the-ideo-process|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps are listed in chronological order:
# Understand and observe the market, the client, the technology, and the limitations of the problem;
# Synthesize the information collected at the first step;
# Visualise new customers using the product;
# Prototype, evaluate and improve the concept;
# Implementation of design changes which are associated with more technologically advanced procedures and therefore this step will require more time.
One of the first developed models that today companies still use in the NPD process is the Booz, Allen and Hamilton (BAH) Model, published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen &amp; Hamilton|first1=Booz|title=New products management for the 1980s|accessdate=22 October 2014|publisher=Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton – original from Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best known model because it underlies the NPD systems that have been put forward later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruiyan|first1=Nadia|title=A framework for successful new product development|journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management|date=2011|volume=4|issue=4|pages=746–770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model represents the foundation of all the other models that have been developed afterwards. Significant work has been conducted in order to propose better models, but in fact these models can be easily linked to BAH model. The seven steps of BAH model are: new [[product strategy]], idea generation, screening and evaluation, business analysis, development, testing, and commercialization. &lt;br /&gt;
A pioneer of NPD research in the consumers goods sector is Robert G. Cooper. Over the last two decades he conducted significant work in the area of NPD. The Stage-Gate model developed in the 1980s was proposed as a new tool for managing new products development processes.  This was mainly applied to the consumers goods industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Robert|title=Stage-gare systems: A new tool for managing new products|journal=Business Horizons|date=1990|volume=33|issue=3|pages=44–55|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 APQC benchmarking study reveals that 88% of U.S. businesses employ a stage-gate system to manage new products, from idea to launch. In return, the companies that adopt this system are reported to receive benefits such as improved teamwork, improved success rates, earlier detection of failure, a better launch, and even shorter cycle times – reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenneth|first1=Kahn|title=The PDMA handbook of new product development|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-64820-9|page=34|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the importance of the stage-gate model in the area of new product development. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the last few years, the [[Lean Startup]] movement has grown in popularity, challenging many of the assumptions inherent in the stage-gate model.

==Marketing considerations==
There have been a number of approaches proposed for analyzing and responding to the marketing challenges of new product development.  Two of these are ''the eight stages'' process of Peter Koen of the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], and a process known as ''the fuzzy front end.''

=== Fuzzy Front End ===

''The Fuzzy Front End'' (FFE) is the messy "getting started" period of new product engineering development processes. It is also referred to as the "Front End of Innovation",&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55" /&gt; or "Idea Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbosch et al.|first=|date=2006|title=Idea Management: A Systemic View|url=|journal=Journal of Management Studies|volume=43|pages=259-288|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hhk3.kau.se/im/|title=Idea Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sukhov|first=Alexandre|date=2018|title=The role of perceived comprehension in idea evaluation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/caim.12262|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process (Kim and Wilemon, 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J. | last2 = Wilemon | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Sources and assessment of complexity in NPD projects | url = | journal = R&amp;D Management | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 16–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koen et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koen|first=|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2001|title=Providing clarity and a common language to the 'fuzzy front end'|url=|journal=Research Technology Management|volume=44|issue=2|pages=46–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept. The Fuzzy Front End phase ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept.

Although the Fuzzy Front End may not be an expensive part of product development, it can consume 50% of development time (see Chapter 3 of the Smith and Reinertsen reference below),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G. and Reinertsen, Donald G. (1998) ''Developing Products in Half the Time'', 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time, money, and the product's nature, thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product. Consequently, this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens "before development," and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time.

Koen et al. (2001), distinguish five different front-end elements (not necessarily in a particular order):&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"/&gt;
# Opportunity Identification
# Opportunity Analysis
# Idea Genesis
# Idea Selection
# Idea and Technology Development
* The first element is the opportunity identification. In this element, large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way. Using the guidelines established here, resources will eventually be allocated to new projects.... which then lead to a structured NPPD (New Product &amp; Process Development) strategy.
* The second element is the opportunity analysis. It is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company. Here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and/or technical trials and research.
* The third element is the idea genesis, which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea. The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs, e.g. a supplier offering a new material/technology or from a customer with an unusual request.
* The fourth element is the idea selection. Its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value.
* The fifth element is the idea and technology development. During this part of the front-end, the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market, customer needs, investment requirements, competition analysis and project uncertainty. Some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the NPPD process (i.e., Stage 0).

A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework has not been developed so far.&lt;ref&gt;Husig and Kohn (2003), Factors influencing the Front End of the Innovation Process: A comprehensive Review of Selected empirical NPD and explorative FFE Studies, Brusell, Juni 2003, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a glossary of PDMA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PDMA Glossary for New Product Development|publisher=Product Development &amp; Management Association|year=2006|url=http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321075449/http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|archivedate=2009-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is mentioned that the Fuzzy Front End generally consists of three tasks: strategic planning, idea generation, and pre-technical evaluation. These activities are often chaotic, unpredictable, and unstructured. In comparison, the subsequent new product development process is typically structured, predictable, and formal.
The term ''Fuzzy Front End '' was first popularized by Smith and Reinertsen (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G., Reinertsen Donald G. (1991) Developing products in half the time, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York&lt;/ref&gt;
R.G. Cooper (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R.G. Predevelopment activities determine new product success, in: Industrial Marketing Management, Vol.17 (1988), No 2, pp. 237–248&lt;/ref&gt;  it describes the early stages of NPPD as a four-step process in which ideas are generated (I), subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment (II) and merged to coherent product concepts (III) which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios (IV). 

=== Other conceptualisations ===
Other authors have divided predevelopment product development activities differently. 

====The Phase Zero of the Stage-Gate Model of New Product Development====
The Stage-Gate model of NPD predevelopment activities are summarised in Phase zero and one,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=R.G.|date=|title=What’s Next?: After Stage-Gate|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5437/08956308X5606963|journal=Research-Technology Management|volume=57|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in respect to earlier definition of  predevelopment activities:&lt;ref&gt;Cooper R.G., Edgett, S.J. (2008), Maximizing productivity in product innovation, in: Research Technology Management, March 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

# Preliminary
# Technical assessment
# [[Supply chain|Source-of-supply]] assessment: suppliers and partners or alliances
# [[Market research]]: market size and segmentation analysis, VoC ([[voice of the customer]]) research
# Product idea testing
# [[Customer value proposition|Customer value]] assessment
# Product definition
# Business and financial analysis

These activities yield essential information to make a Go/No-Go to Development decision. These decisions represent the Gates in the Stage-Gate model.

==== Early Phase of the Innovation Process ====
A conceptual model of Front-End Process was proposed which includes early phases of the innovation process. This model is structured in three phases and three gates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Husig|first1=S|last2=Kohn|first2=S|last3=Poskela|first3=J|year=2005|title=The Role of Process Formalisation in the early Phases of the Innovation Process|conference=12th Int. Prod. Development Conf|place=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Phase 1: Environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential business opportunities.
* Phase 2: Preliminary definition of an idea or concept.
* Phase 3: Detailed product, project or service definition, and Business planning.

The gates are:

* Opportunity screening
* Idea evaluation
* Go/No-Go for development

The final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project. Many professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front End (fuzziness, ambiguity, and uncertainty) make it difficult to see the FFE as a structured process, but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( e.g. Kim and Wilemon, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J., Wilemon, D. (2002): Accelerating the Front End Phase in New Product Development  [http://www.iamot.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Husig et al., 2005 [10] argue that front-end not need to be fuzzy, but can be handled in a structured manner.  In fact Carbone &lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, Critical Success Factors in the Front-End of High Technology Industry New Product Development, Doctoral Dissertation, University of Alabama in Huntsville, November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, et al.,''Front-end success factors and the impact on high technology industry new product development.'' 2012 IEEE International Technology Management Conference, Dallas, Tx, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when using the front end success factors in an integrated process, product success is increased. Peter Koen&lt;ref name="koen2004"&gt;{{citation|last=Koen|first=Peter A.|title=The Fuzzy Front End for Incremental, Platform, and Breakthrough Products|year=2004|journal=PDMA Handbook of New Product Development, 2nd Ed.|pages=81–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in the FFE for incremental, platform and radical projects, three separate strategies and processes are typically involved.&lt;ref name="koen2004" /&gt; The traditional Stage Gate (TM) process was designed for incremental product development, namely for a single product. The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision, but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries.

==== Activity view on Fuzzy-Front End ====
Predevelopment is the initial stage in NPD and consists of numerous activities, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khurana|first1=A|last2=Rosenthal|first2=S.R.|title=Towards Holistic 'Front Ends' in New Product Development|doi=10.1016/S0737-6782(97)00066-0|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|volume=15|year=1998|issue=1|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* product strategy formulation and communication
* opportunity identification and assessment
* idea generation
* product definition
* project planning
* executive reviews

Economical analysis, benchmarking of competitive products and modeling and prototyping are also important activities during the front-end activities.

The outcomes of FFE are the:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* mission statement
* customer needs
* details of the selected idea
* product definition and specifications
* economic analysis of the product
* the development schedule
* project staffing and the budget
* a business plan aligned with corporate strategy

Incremental, platform and breakthrough products include:&lt;ref name="koen2004"/&gt;
* ''Incremental products'' are considered to be cost reductions, improvements to existing product lines, additions to existing platforms and repositioning of existing products introduced in markets.
* ''Breakthrough products'' are new to the company or new to the world and offer a 5–10 times or greater improvement in performance combined with a 30–50% or greater reduction in costs.
* ''Platform products'' establish a basic architecture for a next generation product or process and are substantially larger in scope and resources than incremental projects.

* CUSTOMER CENTERED New Product Development. Focuses on:
** Finding new ways to solve customer problems.
** Create more customer-satisfying experience
*: Companies often rely on technology, but the real success comes from understanding customer needs and values.
*: The most successful companies were the ones that:
** Differentiated from others
** Solved major customer problems
** Offered a compelling customer value proposition
** Engaged customer directly
* TEAM BASED New Product Development
** An approach:
** To deserving new products in which various company's departments work closely together overlapping the steps in the product development process in order to:
*** Save time
*** Increase effectiveness
** Company departments work closely together in cross functional teams overlapping the steps in the product development process (to save time and increase effectiveness).
** Those departments are: legal, marketing, finances, design and manufacturing, suppliers and customer companies.
** If there is a problem, all the company can work.
* SYSTEMATIC New Product Development
** Development process should be holistic (alternative) and systematic not to good ideas die.
** This process is installed on Innovation Management System that collect, review, evaluate new product ideas and manage
*** the company appoints to a senior person to be the Innovation Manager who encourage all the company
*** employees, suppliers, distributors and dealers to become involved in finding and developing new products.
** Then, there is a Cross-Functional Innovation Management Committee which:
*** Evaluate new products ideas
*** Help bringing good ideas
** To sum up, New-Product success requires:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4752">The '''On-line Guitar Archive''' ('''OLGA''') was the first Internet library of guitar and bass [[tablature]], or "tabs". Born from a collection of guitarist internet-forum archives, it was a useful resource for musicians of all genres for over a decade.

==History==
The website began its life in the newsgroups ''rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature''[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature?hl=en] and ''alt.guitar.tab''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.guitar.tab?hl=en], where users would post tabs they had written or requests for tabs of certain songs or artists. The problem was that after a few days, the contents of the forum would be ''aged'' (i.e. removed). Around 1992 the posts were collected together by [[James Bender]] at [[UNLV]] into an [[ftp]] site that later became '''www.OLGA.net'''. In 1994 [[Cathal Woods]] took over the project as archivist.

In 1996, [[EMI|EMI Publishing]] filed a complaint with UNLV, claiming that the archive was in breach of [[Copyright|copyright law]] with songs they had the rights to. Although OLGA was never threatened directly, UNLV kicked the project off its server. Then in 1998, after a new home for the site was found, OLGA received a similar copyright complaint from the [[Harry Fox Agency]] (HFA). As a result, OLGA was forced to shut down, re-emerging later as ''OLGA incorporated'', a registered non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the archive and providing for its bandwidth. The site prior to this final move was preserved as "the old archive," and contributions since the move were stored in "the new archive".

In June 2006 they received a [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take down]] letter from lawyers representing the [[National Music Publishers Association|NMPA]] and the [[Music Publishers' Association|MPA]][http://olga.net], although by this time temporary clones of the archive had started to appear on sites such as Renegade Olga.&lt;ref&gt;http://yro.slashdot.org/story/01/01/02/2222248/lawyers-close-up-renegade-olga&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2007, HFA announced a licensing agreement with [[Musicnotes]] which "authorize[d] a newly launched Musicnotes guitar tab download website that utilizes the copyrighted music of HFA’s participating music publishers on a commission free basis."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAandMusicnotes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070402-legal-guitar-tabs-return-to-the-web.html Legal guitar tabs return to the web&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Though the announcement did not specifically mention where this site would be available, the contact information for the Musicnotes representative also mentioned [[Mxtabs|MXTabs.net]].

Musicnotes is an "Internet-based sheet music retailer and publisher, offering nearly 250,000 pieces of digital sheet music and guitar tablature."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicnotes.com/aboutus.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
To be a candidate for the archive, a file was required to be the author's own work (i.e., interpretation of how to play the song) and cannot have been derived from a published music book, otherwise inclusion in OLGA would have constituted a copyright violation.

==Current status==
In 2006, the Archive removed all 34,000 tablatures on the site.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5305520.stm?ls "Discord over guitar sites"] by Jonathan Duffy from the [[BBC News]], Sept. 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A note posted on the site indicated that those running the site had received "a 'take down' letter from lawyers representing the [[National Music Publishers Association]] and the Music Publishers' Association", according to the linked letter on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olga.net/ The On-Line Guitar Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter it is stated that OLGA "makes available tablature versions of copyrighted musical compositions owned or controlled by members of the NMPA and MPA" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.olga.net/060621-nmpa-p1of6.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally a notice on the site suggested that the shutdown would only be temporary while OLGA attempted to resolve legal issues, the long time archivist for the site has indicated that the situation is permanent.  On a personal web site he stated, "For twelve years I ran OLGA - the On-Line Guitar Archive. RIP."&lt;ref name=woods&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/cathalwoods/other-interests comment at Cathal Woods faculty page] (retrieved 10-28-2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January, 2016, the site appears to have been taken offline.

'''''Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion''''' is a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomical]] study of various world religions which argues for a new definition of the word "[[paganism]]". It was written by the British [[religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] of [[Bath Spa University]] and first published by [[New York University Press]] in 2003.

In ''Pagan Theology'', York presents his controversial theory that the term "paganism", originally a pejorative term to refer to non-Christian religions, should instead be used by scholars to refer specifically to those religious movements who share the common characteristics of [[polytheism]], [[animism]] and life-affirming beliefs. Under this category of "paganism", York therefore includes the extinct historical faiths of pre-Christian Europe, living [[indigenous religions]], several modern religions like [[Shinto]] and [[Hinduism]], and the new religious movements of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]]. Furthermore, York argues that this "paganism" was the "root religion" of humanity, from which later monotheistic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam developed.

Academic reviews of York's book were mixed, with reviewers making note of the ambitious nature of ''Pagan Theology'', but some believing that it failed to present an entirely convincing argument. As a result of this, not all of them agreed with York's proposed categories, citing various reasons why they believed that it should not be employed. In the wider field of [[Pagan studies]] it has been criticised, most notably by Michael F. Strmiska, who argued that it contributed to the cultural oppression of indigenous peoples.

==Background==
At the time of writing, York was a self-proclaimed "pagan practitioner" as well as a religious studies academic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
Commenting on his own personal religious and spiritual beliefs, York related that:

:If I had to name my own denominational predilection, I would say that I am a "religionist." I believe in religion itself and its central role in expanding human consciousness above and beyond immediate daily concerns. I see religion as an ongoing dialogue that questions the purpose of life and our terrestrial incarnations. In my own pursuit and love of religion as religion, I have been particularly attracted to paganism not only as the source and origin of all religion but also as an organic alternative to the institutionalized and parochial insularity that much religious expression has become.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}
In his introduction, York explains his approach to [[religion]], which he chooses to define as "a shared apprehension of the world, humanity, and the supernatural and their interrelation." He proceeds to use a map as a metaphor for religion, noting that both help the individual to navigate their own way through the world. Exclaiming that paganism should be seen as a religion in itself, he criticises earlier religious studies scholars for failing to devote time to a discussion of this term, whose etymology he then explains.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next chapter, entitled "Paganism as Religion", York argues that religious studies scholars should not use "paganism" in reference purely to pre-Christian religions in Europe or [[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopaganism]], but expand it to refer to a far wider group of [[animism|animistic]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs across the world. Putting together a list of five criteria that believes can be used to define "paganism", he then explores a series of seven different religious groups or beliefs and explains how they fit into this category of his: [[Chinese Folk Religion]], [[Shinto]], Primal Tribal Religions, [[shamanism]], American Indian Spirituality, Afro-American Spiritism, and Contemporary Western Paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Redefining "paganism"===
In ''Pagan Theology'', York exclaims that his purpose is to "expand the concept of paganism."&lt;ref name="York 8"&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the term had been originally employed by the early Christians of the [[Roman Empire]] to describe adherents of non-Jewish religions, he notes that the pre-Christian and pre-Islamic beliefs of Europe that this initial description covered are similar to other [[Indigenous religion]]s across the world, and so should also be considered to be "pagan".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, York argues that religious studies scholars should define "paganism" as a religion utilising five specific criteria, all of which were exhibited in the pre-Christian religions of Europe:

:"[P]aganism includes (1) a number of both male and female gods, (2) magical practice, (3) emphasis on ritual efficacy, (4) corpospirituality, and (5) an understanding of gods and humans as codependent and related."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

York argues that many of the world's religious movements fit these criteria and should therefore be labelled "pagan". This includes the original pre-Christian religions of Europe, and the [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Pagan, or ''Neopagan'']] religions inspired by them. To this he adds indigenous religions from North America, Australia and Africa, as well as the religions of the African diaspora such as [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and [[Santeria]]. He furthermore includes two east Asian faiths, [[Chinese traditional religion]] and Japanese [[Shinto]], as well as any practices involving [[shamanism]].

Utilising the figures for global religious adherence that were published by David Barrett in his ''World Christian Encyclopedia'' (1982), York argues that by the year 2000, 6% of the world's population would be "pagan" under his definition of the term.&lt;ref name="York 8"/&gt; According to his reckoning, this makes paganism one of the world's major religious blocs, alongside the "[[Abrahamic religion|Christian-Islamic]]" bloc, the "[[Irreligion|nonreligious/atheist]]" bloc, the "[[Indian religions|Hindu-Buddhist]]" bloc, the "[[new religious movement|new religious]]" block and the "other" bloc, and that as such it should be defined as a [[world religion]] with global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In her review for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Melissa Raphael of the [[University of Gloucestershire]] argued that York's work "does well to remind us that the religious academy has for too long patronized, ignored or (inaccurately) consigned pagan religion and spirituality to the "odds and ends" bin of the [[New Age movement]]." Considering ''Pagan Theology'' to be a "dense and serious study", that was based upon York's "exceptionally well traveled" experiences, Raphael noted however that it was "not quite what I was expecting. The main title would have led me to believe that I had found a book on the divine in Western, earth-based neo-pagan religions. ''Pagan Theology'' is a good deal more ambitious than that".&lt;ref name="Raphael 2004"/&gt; Raphael proceeded to argue that she was "disappointed" that the work "paid little attention to the inflections of gender", in particular considering the prominent role held by female deities in most of the pagan religions described in the book. She also felt some "disquiet" that the word "theology" was being used by York in reference to certain religious groups for whom "the philosophical and cultural freighting of both ''logos'' and ''theos'' are categorically and conceptually alien". Furthermore, she expressed concern over the fact that "many of the religions to which York ascribes paganism would disown it" whilst others would "deny that they share any common essence with other religions."&lt;ref name="Raphael 2004"/&gt;

In her review for the ''[[Sociology of Religion]]'' journal, Mary Jo Neitz of the [[University of Missouri]] noted that she agreed with York that "paganism is a legitimate category of religion for both practitioners and for those of us who study religion." Nonetheless, she disagreed with his position of "establishing universal definitions of paganism as a world religion or an essential practice", arguing that in doing so he was "gloss[ing] over significant differences" between different religious groups by "universalizing" them under cover-all categories. On a more positive note, she felt that the book would be a useful text for those studying courses on world religions, aiding students in asking the question as to "what scholars mean by the category of world religion itself, and who is served by maintaining the traditional boundaries which establish those belief systems and practices that count as insider and those which must be cast outside."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei04|Neitz 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "''Pagan Theology'' will appeal to an international audience of scholars and practitioners of Paganism, similar to that of ''The Pomegranate'', but should also be of interest to scholars of religion more broadly, since York examines paganism in a global context, and as it occurs within other world religions, as root religion."
|salign    = right
|source    = Barbara Jane Davy, 2004.&lt;ref name="Davy 2004"&gt;[[#Dav04|Davy 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Writing in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', Barbara Jane Davy of [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] described ''Pagan Theology'' as being "Part travelogue, part theological argument, [and] part sociological study", providing a "tour through paganism's multiple forms in space and time." Believing that York had presented "a good argument" for using the term "paganism" to refer to a global "root religion", she noted however that "Some readers will sense a conflict between York's presentation of paganism as a world religion and as root religion. This perhaps derives from an ambiguity in his desires about paganism: for it to be a 'proper' religion, worthy of study, and a legitimate form of religious practice, but also to present it as distinctive, unlike all other religion, and as foundational to all religion." She also praised his use of the lower case "paganism" to refer to the global phenomenon, arguing that it "differentiates his subject matter from what is usually understood in Pagan studies as contemporary Paganism, Neopaganism, or sometimes modern or Western Paganism."&lt;ref name="Davy 2004"/&gt; Ultimately, she remarked that her "only complaint" was that she would have liked to have seen York "relate his understanding of paganism to [[Robert Redfield]]'s understanding of folk practices in terms of "little traditions" as opposed to the institutionalized "great traditions" usually identified as "world religions," discussed in ''The Little Community and Peasant Society and Culture'' (1969)."&lt;ref name="Davy 2004"/&gt;

===Reception in Pagan studies scholarship===

====Chas S. Clifton and ''The Pomegranate''====
Writing in volume 6.1 of ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'' (2004), the journal's editor, [[Chas S. Clifton]] of [[Colorado State University–Pueblo]], made reference to York's work in his discussion of the definition of Pagan studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Clifton proceeded to argue that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to "set forth an audacious redefinition of the term "pagan" as Michael York has done", something which Clifton felt "gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7&amp;ndash;8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern European-derived Paganism and Native American and other Indigenous religions of non-European origins involve similar elements, such as reverence for nature, polytheistic pantheons, and life- and body-affirming worldviews, but there are differences as well, stemming from their different cultural, linguistic, and historical backgrounds."
|salign    = right
|source    = Michael F. Strmiska, explaining his opposition to York's ideas, 2005.&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 12"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Writing in the opening paper of his edited academic anthology ''[[Modern Paganism in World Cultures|Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives]]'' (2005), the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska, then working at [[Central Connecticut State University]], commented on York's argument in ''Pagan Theology'', noting that it was the same as that made by the political scientist and practicing Wiccan Gus DiZerega in his book ''Pagans and Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 11"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although considering such a theory to be "thought provoking", Strmiska ultimately rejected it because he felt that "blurring together the religious identities of these many different peoples, with their vastly different historical and contemporary situations, does a disservice to Indigenous peoples' struggles for postcolonial self-determination by conflating them with the very peoples they see as their oppressors and colonizers."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 11"/&gt; Although accepting that "modern Euro-American Pagans" were often "sympathetic" to Indigenous peoples and "interested in learning aspects" of their "cultural and religious traditions", Strmiska noted that the "contemporary situations" between the two ethno-cultural groups was "quite different" and that this "brutal social reality and the immense historical, economic, and political realities that lie behind it cannot be bridged by a simple labelling process or ameliorated by a unilateral proclamation of spiritual unity between modern Pagans and Indigenous peoples."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 12"/&gt;

Strmiska also felt that it was "worth observing the simple courtesy of calling people by the names they wish to be known by and not calling them by names they reject or are uncomfortable with. The designations ''Pagan'' and ''Paganism'', let alone ''Neopagan'' or ''Neopaganism'', are not the terms of choice that Native Americans or other Indigenous peoples usually apply to themselves and their religious traditions."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 13"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to argue that "[d]isagreements over terminology may seem petty or trivial, but they are not if we consider what is at stake for modern Pagans." In particular, he noted both the historical persecution of those labelled pagans and the continued "legal and political" oppression of modern Pagans.&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 13"/&gt;

'''Planet Hunters''' is a [[citizen science]] project to find planets using human eyes. It does this by having users analyze data from the NASA [[Kepler Space Mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Planet Hunters|url=https://www.planethunters.org/#/about|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched by a team led by [[Debra Fischer]] at [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yale.edu/2010/12/16/citizen-scientists-join-search-earth-planets&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Zooniverse|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/|publisher=Zooniverse website|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planet hunting==
The Planet Hunters project exploits the fact that humans are better at recognising visual patterns than computers. The website displays an image of data collected by the NASA Kepler Space Mission and asks human users (referred to as "Citizen Scientists") to look at the data and see how the brightness of a star changes over time. This brightness data is represented as a graph and referred to as a star's ''light curve''. Such curves are helpful in discovering [[extrasolar planets]] due to the brightness of a star decreasing when a planet passes in front of it, as seen from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/transit-light-curve.html|title=Light Curve of a Planet Transiting Its Star|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-04-16|work=NASA|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periods of reduced brightness can thus provide evidence of [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|planetary transits]], but may also be caused by errors in recording, projection, or other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Hunting Tutorial|publisher=Planet Hunters website|url=http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|accessdate=9 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621080836/http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sorting the light curves===
Users are asked to sort the light curves based on the patterns. The patterns available are "quiet" and "variable". When the light curve is quiet, the graph mostly follows a straight path. When the light curve is variable, there are a number of things that it can do. It can be "regular", "pulsating", or "irregular".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorting the Light Curves|url=http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621080836/http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regular light curve means it goes up once and down once, reaching an apex and descending. A pulsating light curve means it goes up and down along the y-axis on a rather steep basis. An irregular light curve has points that go up and down on the y-axis in an unpredictable pattern.

==Special occurrence==

===Eclipsing binary stars===
From time to time, the project will observe eclipsing binary stars. Essentially these are stars that orbit each other. Much as a planet can interrupt the brightness of a star, another star can too. There is a noticeable difference on the light curves. It will appear as a large transit (a large dip) and a smaller transit (a smaller dip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eclipsing Binary Stars|url=http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621080836/http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/hera_college/binary-model.html|title=Eclipsing Binary Light Curves|website=imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplanet systems===
As of December 2017, there are a total of 621 multiplanetary stars, or stars that contains at least two confirmed planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/|title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|last=Schneider|first=Jean|date=16 December 2017|website=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]]|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a multiplanet system plot, there are many different patterns of transit. Due to the different sizes of planets, the transits dip down to different points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiplanet Systems|url=http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621080836/http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar flares===
Stellar flares are observed when there is an explosion on the surface of a star. This will cause the star's brightness to shoot up considerably, with a steep drop off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stellar Flares|url=http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621080836/http://www.planethunters.org/site_guide#video|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
So far, over 12 million observations have been analyzed. Out of those, 34 candidate planets had been found as of July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetometer|url=http://www.planethunters.org/planetometer|publisher=Planet Hunters website|accessdate=10 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721124511/http://www.planethunters.org/planetometer|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 it was announced that two volunteers from the Planet Hunters initiative had discovered a novel [[Neptune]]-like planet which is part of a four star double binary system, orbiting one of the pairs of stars while the other pair of stars orbits at a distance of around 1000 AU. This is the first planet discovered to have a stable orbit in such a complex stellar environment. The system is located just under 5000 light years away, and the new planet has been designated [[PH1]], short for Planet Hunters 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Planet with four suns discovered by volunteers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19950923|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=2013ApJ...768..127S|title=Planet Hunters: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet in a Quadruple Star System|author1=Schwamb|first1=Megan E.|last2=Orosz|first2=Jerome A.|last3=Carter|first3=Joshua A.|last4=Welsh|first4=William F.|last5=Fischer|first5=Debra A.|last6=Torres|first6=Guillermo|last7=Howard|first7=Andrew W.|last8=Crepp|first8=Justin R.|last9=Keel|first9=William C.|last10=Lintott|first10=Chris J.|last11=Kaib|first11=Nathan A.|last12=Terrell|first12=Dirk|last13=Gagliano|first13=Robert|last14=Jek|first14=Kian J.|last15=Parrish|first15=Michael|last16=Smith|first16=Arfon M.|last17=Lynn|first17=Stuart|last18=Simpson|first18=Robert J.|last19=Giguere|first19=Matthew J.|last20=Schawinski|first20=Kevin|volume=1210|date=2012|pages=3612|arxiv=1210.3612|display-authors=9|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/768/2/127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''R''}}|{{color|#900|''R''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''S''}}|{{color|#900|''T''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''T''}}|{{color|#900|''S''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''P''}}|{{color|#900|''P''}}|transparent}}
|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

===Special case: Donation game===
The "donation game"&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbe|first=Christian |author2=Martin A. Nowak |author3=Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of extortion in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games|journal=PNAS|date=April 2013|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6913–18|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6913.abstract|accessdate=25 November 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1214834110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6913H |arxiv=1212.1067}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit ''b'' at a personal cost ''c'' with ''b'' &gt; ''c''. Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! {{diagonal split header|{{navy (color)|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''}}|{{color|#900|-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|0}}|{{color|#900|0}}|transparent}}
|}

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==

If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed-bag exchange===
[[File:Prisoner's Dilemma briefcase exchange (colorized).svg|thumb|The prisoner's dilemma as a briefcase exchange]]
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas R. | last=Hofstadter| authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter | title= [[Metamagical Themas]]: questing for the essence of mind and pattern | publisher= Bantam Dell Pub Group| year=1985 | isbn=0-465-04566-9|chapter= Ch.29 ''The Prisoner's Dilemma Computer Tournaments and the Evolution of Cooperation''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was "closed bag exchange":
{{quote|Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.}}

In this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

The rewards matrix is

! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Pair 1}}|{{color|#900|Pair 2}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:6em;" | {{color|#900|"Friend"&lt;br /&gt;(cooperate)}}

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashden.org/files/case_studies/SRSP%20Pakistan.pdf|title=Winner case study summary: Sarhad Rural Support Programme, Pakistan.|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access, supported by the IKEA Foundation Award|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/SRSP15|title=The power of water brings new life to mountain villages|last=|first=|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webwidemedia.net/rspn/index.php/about-us/awards-recognition|title=Awards &amp; Recognitions {{!}} RSPN|last=|first=|date=|website=Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/804936/what-the-smart-villages-of-pakistan-can-teach-us-about-energy|title=What the ‘smart villages’ of Pakistan can teach us about energy|last=Cheema|first=Abdur Rehman|date=12 March 2016|newspaper=Scroll.in|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. Its field of study overlaps with more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists, which, being a [[paraphyletic group]] embrace [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] ("animal" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).

==History==
As the term "[[protozoology]]" has become dated as our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, the term "protistology" become more common. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of Protistologists in 2005. However, the older term persists in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal Acta Protozoologica).

==Journals and societies==
Dedicated academic journals include:&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M., &amp; Hausmann, K. (2001). Protozoology from the perspective of science theory: history and concept of a biological discipline. ''Linzer biol.

==Notable protistologists (sorted by alphabetical order of surnames) ==
The field of protistology was idealized by Haeckel, but its widespread recognition is more recent. In fact, many of the researchers cited below considered themselves as protozoologists, phycologists, mycologists, microbiologists, microscopists, parasitologists, limnologists, biologists, naturalists, zoologists, botanists, etc., but made significant contributions to the field.

==History==
[[File:Seating for wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Seating in SSL]]
The Social Science Library officially opened 1 October 2004, following a period in which subject collections housed within smaller units were amalgamated into a central library site.
The institution was preceded by the Social Studies Libraries; a grouping of three separate libraries:
* Politics, International Relations, and Sociology Library (PIRS)
* Economics Library (formerly the Institute of Economics and Statistics (IES) until 1999)
* Social Policy and Social Work Library (SPSW)
These three libraries were the first to be combined, at the site of the existing Economics Library, between 2002 and 2003. Further integration followed with the Criminology Library and Socio-Legal Studies Library moving to the site in 2004. The collections housed at the International Development Centre (IDS) at [[Queen Elizabeth House]] joined the Social Science Library after its launch, in the summer of 2005. Material from the Slavonic and East European collections, previously kept within the Bodleian Library Slavonic reading room, also moved into the library later that year.

In March 2010 the Social Science Library was renamed the Bodleian Social Science Library.  This was as result of the Oxford University Library Services - of which the Social Science Library was a part - changing its name to the Bodleian Libraries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10270">The '''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF)''' was an independent [[DNA]] and genealogical research institution with the goal of demonstrating how the peoples of the world are related. SMGF collected DNA samples and genealogical information from individuals across the globe to establish these connections.

== History ==
SMGF originated in 1999 and was inspired by several conversations between inventor and philanthropist [[James LeVoy Sorenson]] and [[Brigham Young University]] professor Dr. [[Scott Woodward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart|first=John L.|title=Unlocking DNA|url=http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/45453/Unlocking-DNA.html|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=[[Church News]]|date=April 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sorenson envisioned the development of a [[genetic genealogy|genetic-genealogical]] blueprint of all humankind.  This blueprint, as developed by Dr. Woodward, would show how closely humans are related to one another, demonstrating the familial relationships between unique individuals.  The collection of DNA samples and associated family pedigrees began in 2000, beginning first with Brigham Young University students, and quickly branching outside of Utah, then to the rest of the world.

In 2003, SMGF moved its operations from the Brigham Young University campus to Salt Lake City.  SMGF also outsourced all of its laboratory work to [[Sorenson Genomics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sorensongenomics.com/about-us/|title=Sorenson Genomics - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing researchers to create a publicly available online repository.  This repository was known as the Sorenson Database.

SMGF collected more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees from donors around the world, all of which were available in the Sorenson Database.  This database was acquired by [[Ancestry.com]] prior to its launch of AncestryDNA when they purchased [[GeneTree]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/05/ancestrycom-buys-genetree-and-launches.html|title=Ancestry.com Buys GeneTree (Another Competitor) and Launches Their New Autosomal DNA Product to Subscribers|publisher=Your Genetic Genealogist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetree was SMGF's commercial arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryinsider.org/2012/05/ancestrycom-launches-ancestrydna.html|title=Ancestry.com Launches AncestryDNA|publisher=Ancestry Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sorenson Database ==
The Sorenson Database contained more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees, encompassing 2.8 million genealogical records and 2.4 million genotypes.

The Sorenson Database matched genetic information with familial surnames.  A person searching through the database was able to find both genetic and genealogical matches, but could search using either DNA haplotypes or familial surname.  The average family pedigree contained six generations of pedigree information (more than 150 years) with over 6 million genetically linked ancestors.

There were only two areas for individuals to search within the Sorenson Database, a [[Y chromosome]] database and a [[mitochondrial DNA]] database.  The Y-DNA database allowed males to search their direct paternal line; the mtDNA database allowed both males and females search their direct maternal line.  According to ISOGG.org, Sorenson "also had large X chromosome and autosomal STR databases, but these databases were never made publicly available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isogg.org/wiki/Sorenson_Molecular_Genealogy_Foundation|title=''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation'' ISOGG Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Y-chromosome Database:

The Y chromosome is passed on from father to son with little changes to Y-DNA. Surnames also tend to generally be passed on from father to son. The Sorenson Database used Y-chromosome genetic markers and surnames to determine common ancestors.  Users could share DNA results and pedigree charts obtained from other sources. They could search for ancestors using their surname, genetic marker values obtained through their DNA analysis, or a combination of the two. The database also had genetic marker default values if users did not have their own genetic information.

A Y-DNA test analyzes similarities in Y-chromosome DNA markers, corresponding to specific locations on the Y chromosome. Markers have a [[Short tandem repeat]] (STR) that involve repeats of 2-5 DNA base pairs. At Sorenson labs, the number of STRs in a 36-marker haplotype was compared between the sample given and the database to determine relatedness. The [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) was also examined. Y-chromosome SNPs are rare and can be used to separate populations of men or haplogroups and can be used in population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfg.stanford.edu/SNP.html|title=''Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics'', Stanford University - Palumbi Lab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial Database:
 
Both males and females inherit their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from their mother, which allows mtDNA to determine a maternal line. The Sorenson Database compared mitochondrial DNA from over 76, 000 people in their mitochondrial database to find cousins connected across generations. Users could share their mtDNA results from other commercial labs.

The mtDNA test examines three regions of the D-loop of mtDNA: HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3 which is called the [[Hypervariable region]]. Mutations in these areas of mtDNA are extremely rare and have likely not changed between maternal-line cousins within the last 500 years. Therefore, looking at mutations in these areas can determine maternal lineages. Samples of mtDNA submitted to the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation were compared to the [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] (CRS) of mtDNA then to each other for relatedness.

== Participation ==
One of the perhaps overly ambitious missions of SMGF was to connect any two individuals in the world, showing to both how they are related.  In order to accomplish this goal, SMGF collected DNA samples and correlated familial pedigrees from participants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Alan (3 July 2011). [http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/07/03/7006641-africans-visit-their-american-cousins]. Published by [[MSNBC]]. Last accessed 19 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching their 100,000 sample goal, SMGF modified their goals to focus less on collecting new samples and more on analysis of previous samples.

New participants were still accepted through SMGF's subsidiary, [[GeneTree]] for many years. Also, previous SMGF participants could buy their DNA report through GeneTree.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation’s Genetic Genealogy Database Crosses Historic Milestone with 100,000 DNA Samples, Aided by Multi-Million Dollar Gift from Founder|publisher =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation|date =April 28, 2010| url =http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100428005716/en/Sorenson-Molecular-Genealogy-Foundation%E2%80%99s-Genetic-Genealogy-Database|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another goal of SMGF was to advance research in the scientific field of molecular genealogy.  SMGF conducted research to identify additional DNA markers which link an individual to their genealogical family, however direct or distant. SMGF researchers published a number of research papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100629005443/en/World-15-%E2%80%98Founding-Mothers%E2%80%99-Latest-Study-Sorenson|title=''New World Had at Least 15 Founding Mothers''|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which involved collaborations with other researchers.

DNA collection for the project initially involved drawing blood samples; since August 2002, the SMGF used a mouthwash-based collection method (GenetiRinse), which has the advantage that it can be mailed to participants living in remote areas.

== Controversy and Shutdown ==
In May 2015, Ancestry.com took down the SMGF website, citing that "the site has been used for purposes other than what was intended, forcing [Ancestry.com] to cease operations on the site."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =RIP Sorenson - A crushing loss|date =May 15, 2015| url =https://dna-explained.com/2015/05/15/rip-sorenson-a-crushing-loss/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action by Ancestry.com was taken in response to news revelations claiming that the SMGF database had been used by Ancestry.com and local law enforcement, without any court oversight [e.g., a warrant] and in violation of SMGF's privacy policy, to try to tie criminal suspects to crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =How Private DNA Data Led Idaho Cops on a Wild Goose Chase and Linked an Innocent Man to a 20-year-old Murder Case|date =May 1, 2015| url =https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/how-private-dna-data-led-idaho-cops-wild-goose-chase-and-linked-innocent-man-20|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actions in the case by all parties, particularly Ancestry.com and the local law enforcement, were eventually recognized to have followed proper constitutional procedures of privacy protection and court oversight in the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =Facts Matter!|date =May 3, 2015| url =http://legalgenealogist.com/blog/2015/05/03/facts-matter/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal significantly impacted Ancestry.com's reputation and led to the decision to deactivate the website and mothball the SMGF database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">The '''Spanish era''' or '''era of Caesar''' was a dating system commonly used in the states of the [[Iberian peninsula]] until the 14th–15th centuries, when it was phased out in favour the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system. The calendar began with year one in what is 38 BC,&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"&gt;Roth, Norman. ''Medieval Iberia An Encyclopedia''. Routledge, 2003, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the date of a new tax imposed by the [[Roman Republic]] on the subdued population of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} Whatever the case, the date signifies the beginning of the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' in Iberia. To convert from an ''Anno Domini'' date to the corresponding year in the Spanish era, add 38 to the ''Anno Domini'' year.&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt; A date in the Spanish era was written thus: "Era CMXLI" for "anno domini 903".

The use of the Caesar Era probably began in Iberia in the 3rd century. The reason for its particular popularity is unknown. Official usage ceased in different parts of the Iberian peninsula at different times: in [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1349, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] 1358, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] 1383 and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] 1422. While the year officially began on 1 January under the Spanish era, that was changed to 25 December when the ''Anno Domini'' system was adopted. (The church, however, used 11 January.)&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt;

The general objectives of '''strategic urban planning''' (SUP) include clarifying which [[city]] model is desired and working towards that goal, coordinating public and private efforts, channelling energy, adapting to new circumstances and improving the living conditions of the citizens affected.

Strategic planning is a technique that has been applied to many facets of human activity; we have only to mention [[Sun Tzu]], Arthur Thomson or [[Henry Mintzberg]]; however, the application of strategic planning to urban contexts, or cities, regions and other [[metropolitan areas]] is a relatively recent development whose beginnings were eminently practical and artistical: a mixture of thought, techniques and art or expertise.

Fifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in [[Barcelona]] in 1993, included the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Community]] Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of [[Amsterdam]], [[Lisbon]], [[Lille]], Barcelona, [[Toronto]] and [[Santiago de Chile]] participated, among others.

At that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.

== History==
Strategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of [[San Francisco]] (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of [[Spain]], crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.

== Description of SUP processes==
An SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:

''The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State and Local Government should mean the instigation of regulations, investment, administrative measures, policy initiatives, etc) but rather a policy contract between public institutions and civil society. For this reason, the process following the approval of the plan and the monitoring and implementation of measures or actions is just as or more important than the process of elaboration and consensual approval.''

SUP is now considered a type of [[Governance]].

== Basic Stages of an SUP process==
* Using the work of the Technical Secretary as a starting point, work groups debate and approve a diagnosis of the city that includes its localisation. The document must be approved by the Executive Committee, by the General Council or a full meeting of the Corporation as the case may be.
* Based on the diagnosis, and keeping in mind its antecedents and conclusions, strengths and weaknesses, the next step is the creation of scenarios and, based on the use of imagination and rigour, the development of prospective tasks related to the creation of future alternatives so that the Executive Committee can select a model or vision for the city. Their choice will be the basis for the generation of related key topics and/or directions for general actions to be taken.
* Once the work teams have been reorganized, mainly made up of key decision-makers and implementers, each key topic and line of action will be dealt with separately, designing a detailed list of necessary and/or advisable projects. Once the results have been consolidated, a prioritised list of projects will be made available from which a selection will be made. The next step is the elaboration of an action plan that includes the agents involved, timing and resources. The people involved in the structure of the process, at least theoretically, are capable of carrying it out; for an example, please consult the document from the General Council of SUP of Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm].
* Once all of the previously mentioned documents have been approved, the next step is implementation - carrying out the project itself. This stage is decisive; at this point plans are usually given a structure in which the organization is even more explicitly clarified.

== Implementation of SUP processes==
The social and economic importance of these processes is quite relevant as they affect millions of people [https://web.archive.org/web/20050101023909/http://www.cideu.org/site/] . In Spain, [http://www.ebropolis.es/web/index.asp] there are nearly one hundred localities that use this methodology, affecting a total population of nearly 15 million people.

== Critical Comments on SUP processes==
Sectors in the area of civic participation, as well as planning professionals and political activists have all expressed criticism of SUP processes.

However, SUP processes include aspects that favour selective participation, territorial organization and coordination/cooperation between public and private sectors. On the other hand, Strategic Urban Planning processes seem to be independent of political ideologies (for example, the SUP processes in Barcelona [http://www.bcn2000.es/en/default_en.aspx], Bilbao [http://www.bm30.es/] and Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm] are carried out with mixed Government teams including the following Spanish political formations: PSC-PSOE  [http://www.socialistes.cat/home/], PNV [http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/] and PP [http://www.pp.es/] respectively) and can produce a notable degree of stability in the majority behind the project.

== Theoretical Development==
Knowledge relating to strategic urban planning processes is evolving in two complementary directions that can be denominated, borrowing concepts from programming, as Bottom-Up and Top-down.

=== Bottom-Up===
There are clear differences between what could be called the traditional approach to Strategic planning and the emerging approach (Fernández Güell. Strategic planning of cities).
* Before Product predominance, now Process predominance
* Before Sector specific, now Integrated
* Before Normative, now Strategic
* Before Goal-oriented, now Cost-benefit oriented
* Before Urban-offer oriented, now Urban-demand oriented
* Before Subject to administrative limitations, now Supersedes administrative limitations and enters in Metropolitan areas
* Before Open participation, now Focused Participation

Of course, in 2006 there was a clear evolution that attempted to adapt to changes, political sensitivities and even trends. In any case, this is a line of thought and action that takes full advantage of the experience of projects that have already been implemented.

=== Top-Down===
Given that:
* The influence of each agent in the global process under consideration for implementation is yet to be determined;
* There are no generally accepted criteria when creating instruments for measuring progress or regression on the path toward achieving main goals;
* Cooperation processes among different agents within the city to carry out strategic planning are usually undertaken using a “framework” organisational structure which highlights differences;
* Both politics and outside events affect a large city;

this line of research seeks to further the design of a model that will determine the factors related to the success of strategic planning processes in large cities and metropolitan areas [https://web.archive.org/web/20090727100029/http://alarcos.inf-cr.uclm.es/per/fruiz/audes5/index.htm] [[:es:Aglomeraciones urbanas en la Unión Europea]] [[:es:Area Metropolitana]] [[:es:Área metropolitana de Valencia]].

Within this branch of research, which seeks a more general theory, two recent Doctoral Theses mentioned in the bibliography can be consulted for further information.

It should be pointed out that a theory explaining Strategic Urban Planning in Metropolitan Areas and/or Regions would involve furthering the consolidation of Social Design [[:es:Diseño Social]] as a scientific study.

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1272">The '''triose phosphate translocator''' is an integral membrane protein found in the inner membrane of [[chloroplasts]]. It exports triose phosphate ([[Dihydroxyacetone phosphate]]) in exchange for inorganic phosphate and is therefore classified as an [[antiporter]]. The imported phosphate is then used for ATP regeneration via the light-dependent-reaction; the ATP may then for example be used for further reactions in the Calvin-cycle.The Translocator protein is responsible for exporting all the [[carbohydrate]] produced in [[photosynthesis]] by plants and therefore most of the carbon in food that one eats has been transported by the triose phosphate translocator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Walters | first1 = R.| last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = D.| last3 = Horton | first3 = P.| last4 = Kruger | first4 = N.| title = A mutant of Arabidopsis lacking the triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator reveals metabolic regulation of starch breakdown in the light| journal = Plant Physiology| volume = 135| issue = 2| pages = 891–906| year = 2004| pmid = 15173568| pmc = 514124| doi = 10.1104/pp.104.040469}}&lt;/ref&gt;
