The '''ATP test''' is a process of rapidly measuring actively growing microorganisms through detection of [[adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP.

==Method==

ATP is a [[molecule]] found in and around living [[cell (biology)|cells]], and as such it gives a direct measure of biological concentration and health. ATP is quantified by measuring the light produced through its reaction with the naturally occurring [[firefly]] enzyme [[luciferase]] using a [[photometer|luminometer]]. The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of ATP present in the sample.  

'''ATP tests can be used to:''' 

* Control biological treatment reactors
* Guide [[biocide]] dosing programs
* Determine drinking water cleanliness
* Manage [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes
* Assess soil activity
* Determine corrosion / deposit process type
* Measure equipment or product sanitation

==1st generation testing ''vs''. 2nd generation testing==

1st generation ATP tests are derived from [[hygiene]] monitoring uses where samples are relatively free of interferences. 2nd Generation tests are specifically designed for water, [[wastewater]] and industrial applications where, for the most part, samples contain a variety of components that can interfere with the ATP assay.

==How ATP is measured==



Within a water sample containing microorganisms, there are two types of ATP:

* [[Intracellular]] ATP – ATP contained within living biological cells.
* [[Extracellular]] ATP – ATP located outside of biological cells that has been released from dead or stressed organisms.

Accurate measurement of these two types of ATP is critical to utilizing ATP-based measurements. Being able to accurately measure these different types of ATP offers the ability to assess biological health and activity, and subsequently control water and [[wastewater]] processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11279">'''Alan F. Segal''' (August 2, 1945 – February 13, 2011) was a scholar of ancient religions, specializing in Judaism's relationship to Christianity. Segal was a distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, self-described as a "believing Jew and twentieth-century humanist."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Alan|title=Paul the Convert: The Apostolate and Apostasy of Paul the Convert|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hew Haven|year=1990|isbn=9780300045277|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}} Segal was one of the first modern scholars to write extensively on the influences of Judaism (including [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple]] Rabbinic texts, [[Merkabah mysticism]], and [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalypticism]]) on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Damascus]].

Segal was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Amherst College]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1967), [[Brandeis University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], 1969), [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] (Bachelor of Hebrew Letters, 1971), and [[Yale University]] (M.A., 1971; [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]], 1973; and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1975). At the time of his retirement, Segal was Professor Emeritus of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor Emeritus of Judaic Studies at [[Barnard College]] and held a concurrent appointment as Adjunct Professor of Scripture at Union Theological Seminary. He had also taught at Princeton University and the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Alan Fr. Segal Remembered|url=http://barnard.edu/headlines/professor-alan-f-segal-remembered|website=Barnard College|publisher=Faculty}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Segal was an expert in the field of history and religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity of the Roman period, and on the Semitic languages in use in Israel in that period. His scholarly reputation commenced with his landmark book, ''Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism'' (1977), in which he explored early references in rabbinic texts that he proposed were directed against beliefs of Jewish Christians and gnostics. His 1986 book, ''Rebecca's Children'', was a sensitive study showing that rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity were sibling developments from the parent biblical tradition. His award-winning book, ''Paul the Convert'' (1990) was Editor's Choice and main selection of the History Book Club's summer 1990 list, and a selection of the Book of the Month Club. The 368 page text is a collection of studies that interprets Paul within the context of Jewish mysticism and history, providing unique depth and insight for Biblical exegetes and Jewish historians. His last book, ''Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion'' (2004) was a massive study of beliefs spanning from ancient near-eastern civilizations to the present and across various religious traditions. Life After Death is "considered one of the definitive treatments of that weighty subject — and was weighty in its own right, at 731 pages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Jay|title=Religious scholar Alan F. Segal, 65, of Ho-Ho-Kus|url=http://www.northjersey.com/obituaries/religious-scholar-alan-f-segal-65-of-ho-ho-kus-1.254299|website=northjersey.com/obituaries|publisher=The Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a selection of the History Book Club, the Book of the Month Club, and the Behaviorial Science Book Club. It also featured on the Leonard Lopate Show, Talk of the Nation, and was the cover story of the Globe and Mail Book Review Supplement (Toronto). In addition, he wrote numbers articles and chapters in scholarly books.

Segal gave conference presentations and lectures internationally. He was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Literature program unit on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, and the SBL program unit on Divine Mediators in Antiquity. In 1988, he was the first Jewish member of the Society for New Testament Studies to address the society. He was elected a member of the American Society for the Study of Religion and the first American living outside Canada to be elected President of the Canadian Society for Biblical Studies.

Until Segal's book ''Paul the Convert'' was published in 1990, most modern Biblical scholars failed to take into account the Jewishness of Paul and the vast majority of Jewish historians ignored Paul altogether because of his perceived anti-Semitic writing.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|xi}} Segal argues in ''Paul the Convert'' that despite Paul's polemical rhetoric, the Jewish community must nevertheless consider the historical value of Paul's epistles because of the insights he provides into first century Hellenisic Judaism. 

Segal's exegetical concern is with the Jewish context of Paul's religious struggle following his conversion. He reads Paul's epistles in light of the social sciences, borrowing from modern sociological and psychological studies (especially those pertaining to conversion). He also examines Paul through the lens of Jewish Merkabah mysticism and the Rabbinic tradition – a pioneering method of study of the New Testament. Segal argues that in order to understand Paul thoroughly, one must understand the circumstances of his time and culture. Segal draws similarities between things like Paul's description of his conversion on the road to Damascus (2 Cor. 12:1-9) and Ezekiel and Enoch's heavenly ascent.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|39–47}} He argues that Paul's emphasis on the Glory of God (Kavod) in these stories is characteristic of the Merkabah mystic tradition. The type of exegesis that Segal engages in provides a rare insight into first century thinking.

Segal understands Paul as part of Jewish history; he interprets Paul's conversion as an apostasy and a break from Judaism because of his insistence on transformation in Christ,&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|117}} although Paul never perceived his actions as outside the Jewish community (Acts 21:24). Paul, Segal argues, never felt that he had left Judaism, "He began as a Pharisee and became a convert from Pharisaism. He spent the rest of his life trying to express what he converted to. He never gave it a single name."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|283}} Paul's conversion experience, Segal argues, forced him to re-evaluate his faith and understanding of the Torah; he was made to reconcile his revelation with his Pharasaism.

Segal was a frequent media commentator on St. Paul&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/143/story_14384_1.html Do the Gospels Correct Paul's Letters? By Alan F.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology of art''' is a sub-field in [[social anthropology]] dedicated to the study of [[art]] in different cultural contexts. The anthropology of art focuses on historical, economic and aesthetic dimensions in non-Western art forms, including what is known as '[[tribal art]]'.

==History==
[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern [[anthropology]], conducted many field studies of the arts, helping create a foundation to the field. His book, ''Primitive Art'' (1927), summarizes his main insights into so-called 'primitive' art forms, with a detailed case study on the arts of the Northwest Pacific Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas. (1927) ''Primitive art''.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] took Boas' analyses further in his book ''The Way of the Masks'', where he traced changes in the plastic form of Northwest Pacific masks to patterns of intercultural interaction among the indigenous peoples of the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss. (1982) ''The Way of the Masks''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Problem of Art==
One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Morphy &amp; Morgan Perkins. (2006) Introduction, in ''The Anthropology of Art: A Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Angioni, ''Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture'', Nuoro, il Maestrale, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book ''Art and Agency'', [[Alfred Gell]] proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Gell. (1998) ''Art and Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Bowden. (2004) A Critique of Alfred Gell on Art and Agency. ''Oceania'', 74: 309-325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Layton. (2003) Art and Agency: A reassessment. ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 9: 447-464&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Morphy. (2009). Art as a Mode of Action: Some Problems with Gell’s Art and Agency.

The episode focuses on the release of the new eyePhone, resulting in [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] posting a [[viral video]] of [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] on the Internet. [[Craig Ferguson]], host of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', guest stars as Leela's singing [[boil]], Susan.

==Plot==
The episode opens with the Planet Express crew recycling their old electronics. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]] announces that they will be delivering all the Earth’s [[e-waste]] to the Third World of the [[Antares]] system. After dropping them off, they decide it would be better to keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new [[iPhone|eyePhone]]. The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the [[Twitter|Twitcher]] application. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.

Meanwhile, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] reveals to her sons that the eyePhones allow her to direct market to the users, based on what they post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be transmitted as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.

Fry decides he needs to have more interesting twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his eyePhone, in spite of his promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including [[Hermes Conrad]], [[Amy Wong]] and Pro. Farnsworth.

Leela discovers that her humiliation is old news and that a new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals to her that he posted a video of himself completing the loser’s side of the bet in order to make up for the humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the eyePhone 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.

==Continuity==
Bender's good twin [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Flexo|Flexo]] makes a brief cameo in one of the recycling bins.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; The cell phone [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]] throws away before getting an eyePhone is the same as in "[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in "[[A Leela of Her Own]]".

==Cultural references==
Most of the episode focuses on parodies of the [[iPhone]] and [[Twitter]], renamed the eyePhone and Twitcher respectively.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html |title=Futurama: "Attack of the Killer App" Review |author=Canning, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704042349/http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyePhone is placed directly in the eye, hence the name ''eye''Phone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==
In the original American broadcast, "Attack of the Killer App" was viewed by an estimated 2.159 million households receiving a 1.3 rating/2% share in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and 1.1 rating/4% share in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051 |title=Thursday Cable Ratings: USA’s Royal Pains &amp; Burn Notice lead Thursday cable pack; Bethenny Lags Futurama |author=Seidman, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers |accessdate=2010-07-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704143202/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Canning of [[IGN]] in his review gave the episode an 8.5 calling it "Great" and also stated in his review ""Attack of the Killer App" had more than enough great laughs to outweigh this weak bit", in reference to the Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying "This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew."&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be "mean-spirited" but clever and so "bizarre that it worked".&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; Darren Franich of [[Entertainment Weekly|EW]] Popwatch said the episode was "as good as anything the show produced in its prime" particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling "outdated".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/ |title='Futurama' has returned: Well, IS it still good? |first=Darren |last=Franich |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705101625/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/| archivedate= 5 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Gandert of [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] rated the episode a 7.1.

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government.

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P. J. |last2=Henry |title=Gender Inequality and Gender Differences in Authoritarianism |year=2012 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1301–15 |doi=10.1177/0146167212449871 |pmid=22733982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful world of the very late 20th century—the world of [[NAFTA]] and an expanding [[NATO]]; of the World Wide Web 1.0 and liberal interventionism; of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as [[Václav Havel]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]—now looks battered and delusive."&lt;ref name="Frum-liberalism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frum |first1=David |title=The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism |journal=Atlantic |date=November 2018 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-case-for-liberal-republicanism/570790/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote that Fukuyama's idea of liberalism vanquishing authoritarianism "now looks like a quaint artifact of a vanished unipolar moment",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; and Fukuyama himself expressed concern.&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"/&gt;  By 2018 only one Arab Spring uprising — in Tunisia — resulted in a transition to constitutional democratic governance,&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"/&gt; and a "resurgence of authoritarianism and [[Islamic extremism]]" in the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yun Ru Phua |url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/03/30/after-every-winter-comes-spring-tunisias-democratic-flowering/ |title=After Every Winter Comes Spring: Tunisia’s Democratic Flowering – Berkeley Political Review |publisher=Bpr.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dubbed the "[[Arab Winter]]".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/9753123/Middle-East-review-of-2012-the-Arab-Winter.html |title=Middle East review of 2012: the Arab Winter | work = The Telegraph |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The Jerusalem Post | url = http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Analysis-Arab-Winter-is-coming-to-Baghdad-359348 |title = Analysis: Arab Winter is coming to Baghdad | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2014/April/Expert-Warns-of-Americas-Coming-Arab-Winter/ |title=Expert Warns of America's Coming 'Arab Winter' |publisher=CBN |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-arab-winter |title= The Arab Winter|work= The New Yorker | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spu.edu/about-spu/news/articles/2014/may/arab-spring |title= Arab Spring or Arab Winter?| publisher= The New Yorker | accessdate= October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations offered for the new spread of authoritarianism by supporters include excessive immigration into European and Western countries, and the "primary and existential fear" of the "surrender" by liberal democracy of "national sovereignty and independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BUCHANAN |first1=PATRICK J. |title=Why the Authoritarian Right is on the Rise, |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/why-the-authoritarian-right-is-on-the-rise/ |website=American Conservative |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit  the downside of globalization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bhagavan |first1=Manu |title=We are witnessing the rise of global authoritarianism on a chilling scale |url=https://qz.com/643497/we-are-witnessing-the-rise-of-global-authoritarianism-on-a-chilling-scale/ |website=Qz.com |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the success of the [[Beijing Consensus]], i.e. the authoritarian model of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-success"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=China's Success Explains Authoritarianism's Allure |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/china-s-success-explains-authoritarianism-s-allure?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In at least one country, (the U.S.) factors blamed for the  growth of authoritarianism include the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and slower real wage growth;&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-why"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Why is authoritarianism on the rise? |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/why-is-authoritarianism-on-the-rise.html |website=marginalrevolution.com |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media's elimination of "gatekeepers" of knowledge, so that a large fraction of the population considers to be opinion what were once "viewed as verifiable facts” – everything from the danger of global warming to the preventing the spread of disease through vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America (Review of Cass Sunstein book ''Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America'') |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=8 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''City Beautiful Movement''' was a reform philosophy of [[North America]]n [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]] that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s with the intent of introducing [[beauty|beautification]] and [[monument]]al grandeur in cities. The movement, which was originally associated mainly with [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], promoted beauty not only for its own sake, but also to create moral and [[civic virtue]] among urban populations.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel M. Bluestone, Columbia University, (September 1988).[https://www.jstor.org/pss/990300 Detroit's City Beautiful and the Problem of Commerce] ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', Vol. XLVII, No. 3, pp. 245-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the philosophy believed that such beautification could promote a [[Socialist harmonious society|harmonious social order]] that would increase the quality of life, while critics would complain that the movement was overly concerned with aesthetics at the expense of social reform; [[Jane Jacobs]] referred to the movement as an "architectural design cult."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Jacobs|Jacobs, Jane]]. ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (New York: Random House, 1961), p.375; quoted in [[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p.27. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and effect===
The movement began in the United States in response to crowding in [[tenement]] districts, a consequence of high birth rates, increased [[immigration]] and internal migration of rural populations into cities. The movement flourished for several decades, and in addition to the construction of monuments, it also achieved great influence in urban planning that endured throughout the 20th century, particularly in regard to United States [[housing project|public housing]] projects. The "[[Garden city movement|Garden City]]" movement in Britain influenced the contemporary planning of some newer suburbs of [[London]], and there was cross-influence between the two aesthetics, one based in formal garden plans and urbanization schemes and the other, with its "[[semi-detached]] [[villa]]s" evoking a more rural atmosphere.

===Architectural idioms===
The particular architectural style of the movement borrowed mainly from the contemporary [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and  [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architectures, which emphasized the necessity of order, dignity, and harmony.

===World's Columbian Exposition===
The first large-scale elaboration of the City Beautiful occurred during the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 in [[Chicago]]. The planning of the exposition was directed by architect [[Daniel Burnham]], who hired architects from the eastern United States, as well as the [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], to build large-scale Beaux-Arts monuments that were vaguely classical with uniform [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] height. The exposition displayed a model city of grand scale, known as the "White City", with modern [[transport]] systems and no poverty visible. The exposition is credited with resulting in the large-scale adoption of monumentalism for American architecture for the next 15 years. [[Richmond, Virginia]]'s [[Monument Avenue]] is one expression of this initial phase.

===Louisiana Purchase Exposition===
The popularization begun by the World Columbian Exposition was increased by the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis in 1904. The commissioner of architects selected Franco-American architect [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] to be Chief of Design of the fair. In this position, which Masqueray held for three years, he designed the following fair buildings in the prevailing Beaux Arts mode: the Palace of Agriculture; the cascades and colonnades; the Palace of Forestry, Fish, and Game; the Palace of Horticulture; and the Palace of Transportation. All these were widely emulated in civic projects across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marter, Joan M. The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Vol. 1. pp. 602-03. Oxford UP, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Masqueray resigned soon after the fair opened in 1904, having been invited by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul to Minnesota to design a new cathedral for the city in the fair's Beaux-Arts style. Other celebrated architects of the fair's buildings, notably [[Cass Gilbert]], who designed the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], originally the fair's Palace of the Fine Arts, similarly employed City Beautiful ideas from the exposition throughout their careers.

===McMillan Plan===
{{main|McMillan Plan}}

An early use of the City Beautiful ideal with the intent of creating social order through beautification was the [[McMillan Plan]], (1902) named for Michigan Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]]. The plan emerged from the [[Senate Park Commission]]'s redesigning of the monumental core of [[Washington, D.C.]] to commemorate the city's centennial and to fulfill unrealized aspects of the city plan of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] a century earlier.

The Washington planners, who included Burnham, Saint-Gaudens, [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] of [[McKim, Mead, and White]], and [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]], visited many of the great cities of [[Europe]]. They hoped to make Washington monumental and green like the European capitals of the era; they believed that state-organized beautification could lend legitimacy to government during a time of social disturbance in the United States. The essence of the plan surrounded the [[United States Capitol]] with monumental government buildings to replace "notorious [[slum]] communities". At the heart of the design was the creation of the [[National Mall]] and eventually included Burnham's [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. The implementation of the plan was interrupted by [[World War I]] but resumed after the war, culminating in the construction of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in 1922.

===Influence in other cities===
{{see also|Group Plan|Olmsted Portland park plan}}

The success of the City Beautiful philosophy in Washington, D.C., is credited with influencing subsequent plans for beautification of many other cities, including [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] ([[The Mall (Cleveland)|The Mall]]), [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] (with the axis along State Street from the Ohio State Capitol building east to the Metropolitan Library and west to the Scioto River), [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]] (the [[Cultural Center Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Cultural Center]], [[Belle Isle Park (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] and [[Outer Drive]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usp100detroit.wordpress.com/city-beautiful/|title=City Beautiful|author=|date=10 March 2016|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/history-of-the-mystery/Content?oid=2179308|title=History of the mystery|first=Curt|last=Guyette|date=|website=Detroit Metro Times|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (with the axis from the capitol building through State Street and to the University of Wisconsin campus), [[Montreal]], [[New York City]] (notably the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]]), [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] (the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] museum district between [[Philadelphia City Hall]] and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]), [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] (the [[Schenley Farms]] district in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of parks, museums, and universities), [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] ([[San Antonio River]] development), [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (manifested by its [[Civic Center, San Francisco, California|Civic Center]]), and the Washington State Capitol Campus in Olympia and the University of Washington's Rainier Vista in Seattle. In [[Wilmington, Delaware]], it inspired the creation of [[Rodney Square]] and the surrounding civic buildings.  In [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[John Russell Pope]] developed a plan for [[Yale University]] that eliminated substandard housing and relocated the urban poor to the peripheries. [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], undertook the installation of parkways and parks under the influence of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p135. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coral Gables]], Florida would be an example of a city consistent with the City Beautiful philosophy.

====Chicago====

Daniel Burnham's [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|1909 Plan of Chicago]] is considered one of principal documents of the City Beautiful movement.  The plan featured a dynamic new civic center, axial streets, and a lush strip of parkland for recreation alongside the city's lakefront.  Of these, only the lakefront park was implemented to any significant degree.

In 1913, the City of Chicago appointed a Commission with a mandate to “make Chicago Beautiful.”  As part of the plan, the Pennsylvania Union Railroad Depot was to be moved to the west side of the City and replaced with a new modern depot.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years (Amazon), pp 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The West Side Property Owner’s Association was among those who objected.  As reported by the Chicago Tribune, the Association’s attorney, Sidney Adler of Loeb &amp; Adler, said, “As I saw the beautiful picture of the city beautiful we will have fountains in West Madison Street, with poets and poetesses walking along Clinton, and the simple minded residents of the west side, after work is done, will take their gondolas and row on the limpid bosom of the Chicago River idlely strumming guitars.” &lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, May 29, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coral Gables====
{{Main|Coral Gables, Florida}}

Planned out as a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]] in the early 1920s by [[George Edgar Merrick]] during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] was developed entirely upon the City Beautiful movement, with obelisks, fountains, and monuments seen in street roundabouts, parks, city buildings and around the city. Today, Coral Gables is one of Miami's most expensive suburban communities, long known for its strict zoning regulations which preserve the City Beautiful elements along with its [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] style, which is prevalent throughout the city. Coral Gables has many parks and a heavy [[tree canopy]] with an [[urban forest]] planted largely in the 1920s.

====Denver====
{{Main|Civic Center, Denver}}

In [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], Mayor [[Robert W. Speer]] endorsed City Beautiful planning, with a plan for a Civic Center, disposed along a grand esplanade that led to the [[Colorado State Capitol]]. The plan was partly realized, on a reduced scale, with the Greek amphitheater, Voorhies Memorial and the Colonnade of Civic Benefactors, completed in 1919. The [[Andrew Carnegie|Andrew Carnegie Foundation]] funded the Denver Public Library (1910), which was designed as a three-story Greek Revival temple with a colossal [[Ionic order|Ionic colonnade]] across its front; inside it featured open shelves, an art gallery and a children's room.  Monuments and vistas were an essential feature of City Beautiful urban planning: in Denver, Paris-trained American sculptor [[Frederick William Macmonnies|Frederick MacMonnies]] was commissioned to design a  monument marking the end of the [[Smoky Hill Trail]]. The bronze Indian guide he envisaged was vetoed by the committee and replaced with an equestrian [[Kit Carson]].

====Harrisburg====

Harrisburg's movement of beautification and improvement was one of the earliest and most successful urban reform movements in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The City Beautiful Movement|last = Wilson|first = William H.|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1989|isbn = 0801837588|location = Baltimore|pages = 126–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began when local minded residents became convinced that their city was unattractive, unhealthy, and filthy, and lacked the appearance and facilities appropriate to its status as Pennsylvania's state capital. The causes of the city's defects were well known: industrialization in the previous half century had left the city poorly planned with unpaved streets and undeveloped water management systems. Residents of Harrisburg suffered disease and illnesses caused by the lack of good filtration systems that could filter the sewage dumped by populations further up the Susquehanna River. A disastrous fire that consumed the state capitol in 1897 had spawned new conversation about the suitability of Harrisburg as a state capital.

The improvement campaign was sparked by a riveting speech of conservationist [[Mira Lloyd Dock]] to the Harrisburg Board of Trade on December 20, 1900. Dock wanted to publicly challenge the horrific conditions in Harrisburg, and set out to gain public sentiment in support of changing them.   
Dock’s speech was titled “The City Beautiful” or “Improvement Work at Home and Abroad”, and this was the starting point for Harrisburg’s city improvements.  Dock’s contemporary and closest ally in her drive for urban beautification was J. Horace McFarland, who was the president of the American Civic Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambliss|first1=Julian|title=Perfecting Space: J. Horace McFarland and the American Civic Association|journal=Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies|date=2010|volume=77|issue=4|pages=486–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With McFarland and Dock working together, they were able to push the process of municipal improvement in Harrisburg by convincing prominent community leaders to donate money, and by gathering the support of the majority of citizens.  In April 1901, the Harrisburg Telegraph, a city newspaper, published a front-page article on the city’s problems, which stressed Dock’s message of beautification and recreation, paved streets, clean water, a city hall, land for parks, and a covered sewer interceptor along the river. The following February 1901, the population voted in favor of a bond issue that funded $1.1 million in new constructions and city planning. These improvements, combined with a new state capitol building in 1906, quickly transformed Harrisburg into a proud modern city by 1915.

====Memphis====
In [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the City Beautiful Commission was officially established by a city ordinance on July 1, 1930, making it the first and oldest beautification commission in the nation. It was the brainchild of the mayor, Mr. [[E. H. Crump]]. The first Commission was appointed and had operating expenses of $1,500. A small office was set up in [[The Nineteenth Century Club]]. Mrs. E. G. Willingham was chosen as chairman and Mrs. William B. Fowler served as vice chairman. In 1935, the Riverside Drive project was dedicated. Costing nearly $1,000,000 (largely WPA funds) the City Beautiful Commission landscaped the bluffs with crape myrtle, redbuds, magnolias, dogwoods and Paul Scarlet roses. White roses were planted at each guardrail post. In 1936, Mrs. William B. Fowler became chairman of the City Beautiful Commission and served for many years. City Beautiful grew under her leadership and soon had to relocate to  larger headquarters. Through the efforts of City Beautiful, Memphis gained the title of cleanest city in Tennessee in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946.  Memphis also received the Ernest T. Trigg “Nation’s Cleanest City” award in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. During this time, volunteers were organized into Wards and Block Clubs with Ward Chairmen and Block Captains. The City Beautiful staff grew to include 30 inspectors by 1954 who worked through these organizations to identify and improve eyesores. Memphis participated with the {{req|National Clean-Up, Paint-Up, Fix-Up Beautification Bureau|American Coatings Association}} headquartered in Washington, D.C.[http://www.paint.org/about-aca/history/][https://books.google.com/books?id=VifrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT586][https://books.google.com/books?id=1u01AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA56]  In 1978, the Commission was reorganized, eliminating the field inspectors.  In February 1989, the Commission moved to its present location at The Massey House in [[Victorian Village, Memphis]].

====Palos Verdes Estates====
In the 1920s, [[Palos Verdes Estates, California]] was established as a master planned community by noted American landscape architect, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. The community was designed as a "City Beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Gates THE PALOS VERDES RANCH PROJECT: Olmsted Brothers' Design Development For A Picturesque Los Angeles Suburban Community Of The 1920s  Available at http://corbu2.caed.kent.edu/architronic/v6n1/v6n1.03a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Among its earliest structures were the buildings comprising Malaga Cove Plaza which were designed in a [[Mediterranean Revival style]] popular with the City Beautiful movement.

== In Australia ==
Both European and North American cities provided models for the Australian City Beautiful movement. A combination of elements about 1900 also influenced the movement:
* It was thought that Australia, being a country that was relatively newly settled by Europeans, had wasted an opportunity to design cities comprehensively and aesthetically.&lt;ref name="Freestone1"&gt;Freestone R (2000) From city improvement to the city beautiful; chapter 2. In: Hamnett S and Freestone R (eds) The Australian Metropolis: A Planning History. Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Australian cities were seen as lacking beauty and civic pride.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;
* The lack of architectural features, and extensive street advertising, were also concerns. This was attributed to “materialism, apathy, short-sightedness, political interference and indifference”.&lt;ref name="Freestone2"&gt;Freestone R (2007) Designing Australia’s cities. UNSW Press, Kensington, pp. 45–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Utopian city plans were another influence on the Australian City Beautiful movement. A better Brisbane, for example, was described by Louis Esson and illustrated by Lloyd Rees with a Parisian influence.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt;

However, City Beautiful was not solely concerned with aesthetics. The term ‘beautility’ derived from the American city beautiful philosophy, which meant that the beautification of a city must also be functional. Beautility, including the proven economic value of improvements,  influenced Australian town planning.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;

There were no formal city beautiful organisations that led this movement in Australia; rather it was influenced by communications among professionals and bureaucrats, in particular architect-planners and local government reformers.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt; In the early Federation era some influential Australians were determined that their cities be progressive and competitive. Adelaide was used as an Australian example of the “benefits of comprehensive civic design” with its ring of parklands. Beautification of the city of Hobart, for example, was considered a way to increase the city’s popularity as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;

===Canberra===
[[Walter Burley Griffin]] incorporated City Beautiful principles for his design for [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt; Griffin was influenced by Washington “with grand axes and vistas and a strong central focal point”&lt;ref name="Stelter GA 2000 pp. 98"&gt;Stelter GA (2000) Rethinking the significance of the City Beautiful idea. In; Freestone R, Urban planning in a changing world: The twentieth century experience. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 98–117.&lt;/ref&gt; with specialised centres and, being a landscape architect, used the landscape to complement this layout.&lt;ref&gt;Banks JCG, Bracks CL (2003) Canberra’s urban forest: evolution and planning for future landscapes. Urban [[Forestry]] &amp; Urban Greening 1(3), 151-160.&lt;/ref&gt; John Sulman, however, was Australia's "leading  proponent" of the City Beautiful movement and, in 1921, wrote the book ''An Introduction to Australian City Planning''.&lt;ref name="Stelter GA 2000 pp. 98"/&gt; Both the City Beautiful and the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] philosophies were represented by Sulman’s “geometric or contour controlled” designs of the circulatory road systems in Canberra. The widths of pavements were also reduced and vegetated areas were increased, such as planted road verges.&lt;ref&gt;Ward A (2000) Assessment of Garden City planning principles in the ACT. Environment ACT, Heritage Unit, Canberra. Available at http://www.tams.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/13177/gardencity.pdf (verified 18 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne===
Melbourne’s grid plan was considered dull and monotonous by some people, and so the architect William Campbell designed a blueprint for the city. The main principle behind this were diagonal streets, providing sites for new and comprehensive architecture and for special buildings. The designs of Paris and Washington were major inspirations for this plan.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt;

===City Beautiful in Australia today===
[[World War I]] prolonged the City Beautiful movement in Australia, as more memorials were erected than in any other country. Although City Beautiful, or artistic planning, became a part of comprehensive town planning, the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s largely ended this fashion.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt; Now, however, in Australia, many streets are tree-lined and streetscapes and skylines are regulated. This was largely a result of the City Beautiful philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Algorithmic topology''', or '''computational topology''', is a subfield of [[topology]] with an overlap with areas of [[computer science]], in particular, [[computational geometry]] and [[computational complexity theory]].

A primary concern of algorithmic topology, as its name suggests, is to develop efficient [[algorithm]]s for solving problems that arise naturally in fields such as [[computational geometry]], [[graphics]], [[robotics]], [[structural biology]] and [[chemistry]], using methods from [[computable topology]].&lt;ref&gt;Afra J. Zomorodian, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oKEGGMgnWKcC Topology for Computing], Cambridge, 2005, xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major algorithms by subject area==

===Algorithmic 3-manifold theory===

A large family of algorithms concerning [[3-manifold]]s revolve around [[normal surface]] theory, which is a phrase that encompasses several techniques to turn problems in 3-manifold theory into integer linear programming problems.

* ''Rubinstein and Thompson's 3-sphere recognition algorithm''.  This is an algorithm that takes as input a [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] [[3-manifold]] and determines whether or not the manifold is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]].  It has exponential run-time in the number of tetrahedral simplexes in the initial 3-manifold, and also an exponential memory profile. Moreover, it is implemented in the software package [[Regina (program)|Regina]].&lt;ref&gt;B.~Burton. Introducing Regina, the 3-manifold topology software,    Experimental Mathematics 13 (2004), 267–272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul Schleimer went on to show the problem lies in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgar/Maths/np.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, Raphael Zentner showed that the problem lies in the complexity class coNP&lt;ref&gt;R. Zentner. Integer homology 3-spheres admit irreducible representations in SL(2,C), https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08530&lt;/ref&gt;, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds. He uses instanton gauge theory, the geometrization theorem of 3-manifolds, and subsequent work of Greg Kuperberg &lt;ref&gt;G. Kuperberg. Knottedness is in NP, modulo GRH. Adv. Math., 256:493–506, (2014), https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0845&lt;/ref&gt; on the complexity of knottedness detection.
* The [[connected sum|connect-sum]] decomposition of 3-manifolds is also implemented in [[Regina (program)|Regina]], has exponential run-time and is based on a similar algorithm to the 3-sphere recognition algorithm.
* Determining that the Seifert-Weber 3-manifold contains no incompressible surface has been algorithmically implemented by Burton, Rubinstein and Tillmann &lt;ref&gt;B. A. Burton, J. H. Rubinstein and S. Tillmann, The Weber–Seifert dodecahedral space is non-Haken, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 364 (2012), 911–932, https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4625&lt;/ref&gt; and based on normal surface theory.
* The ''Manning algorithm'' is an algorithm to find hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds whose [[fundamental group]] have a solution to the [[Word problem for groups|word problem]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Manning, Algorithmic detection and description of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds with solvable word problem, Geometry and Topology 6 (2002) 1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the [[JSJ decomposition]] has not been implemented algorithmically in computer software.  Neither has the compression-body decomposition.  There are some very popular and successful heuristics, such as [[SnapPea]] which has much success computing approximate hyperbolic structures on triangulated 3-manifolds.  It is known that the full classification of 3-manifolds can be done algorithmically.&lt;ref&gt;S.Matveev, Algorithmic topology and the classification of 3-manifolds, Springer-Verlag 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conversion algorithms ====

* [[SnapPea]] implements an algorithm to convert a planar [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] or [[Knot (mathematics)#knot diagram|link diagram]] into a cusped triangulation.  This algorithm has a roughly linear run-time in the number of crossings in the diagram, and low memory profile.  The algorithm is similar to the Wirthinger algorithm for constructing presentations of the [[fundamental group]] of link complements given by planar diagrams. Similarly, SnapPea can convert [[surgery theory|surgery]] presentations of 3-manifolds into triangulations of the presented 3-manifold.
* D.Thurston and F.Costantino have a procedure to construct a triangulated 4-manifold from a triangulated 3-manifold.  Similarly, it can be used to construct surgery presentations of triangulated 3-manifolds, although the procedure is not explicitly written as an algorithm in principle it should have polynomial run-time in the number of tetrahedra of the given 3-manifold triangulation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Costantino, D.Thurston. 3-manifolds efficiently bound 4-manifolds. Journal of Topology 2008 1(3):703–745&lt;/ref&gt;
* S. Schleimer has an algorithm which produces a triangulated 3-manifold, given input a word (in [[Dehn twist]] generators) for the [[mapping class group]] of a surface.  The 3-manifold is the one that uses the word as the attaching map for a [[Heegaard splitting]] of the 3-manifold.  The algorithm is based on the concept of a ''layered triangulation''.

===Algorithmic knot theory===

* Determining whether or not a knot is trivial is known to be in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* The problem of determining the genus of a knot is known to have complexity class [[PSPACE]].
* There are polynomial-time algorithms for the computation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] of a knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|Main_Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational homology===

Computation of [[homology group]]s of [[CW complex|cell complexes]] reduces to bringing the boundary matrices into [[Smith normal form]]. Although this is a completely solved problem algorithmically, there are various technical obstacles to efficient computation for large complexes. There are two central obstacles. Firstly, the basic Smith form algorithm has cubic complexity in the size of the matrix involved since it uses row and column operations which makes it unsuitable for large cell complexes. Secondly, the intermediate matrices which result from the application of the Smith form algorithm get filled-in even if one starts and ends with sparse matrices.

==History==
Historically, the use of day rooms dates as far back as the [[hotel]] itself. In literary history, has been associated with the idea of renting rooms on an hourly basis.&lt;ref name="Hotel as Setting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias|first1=Bettina|title=The Hotel as Setting in Early Twentieth-century German and Austrian Literature|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=41, 62, 79|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, this practice had a negative connotation for hotels and motels.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe" /&gt; In Japan, this practice is commonplace, but exclusive to a specific type of hotel called a [[love hotel]].&lt;ref name="Love Hotel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bertrand|first1=Zaza|title=Brief encounters: Japan's love hotels – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/nov/30/japanese-whispers-zaza-bertrand-love-hotels-ibasho|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long layovers and unpredictable travel plans re-created the demand for day rooms in modern times. In the [[United States]], jobs that require travel became more popular in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe" /&gt; The practice of renting a hotel room for a day is also common among travelers and vacationers who go on cruises, as well as commuters visiting cities for conferences and those with long layovers, due to the fact that cruise ships typically depart and arrive at early hours of the morning.&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plunkett|first1=Jack W.|title=Plunkett's Airline, Hotel &amp; Travel Industry Almanac 2008: Airline, Hotel &amp; Travel Industry Market Research, Statistics, Trends &amp; Leading Companies|date=2007|publisher=Plunkett Research, Ltd.|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is usually more affordable than booking a hotel overnight. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifehacker.com/book-hotels-at-a-discount-for-the-day-with-dayuse-1819741029|title=Book Hotels at a Discount for the Day with Dayuse|last=Price|first=Emily|work=Lifehacker|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day rooms are now being used for charitable work as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/closer-look-rescue-mission-details-plans-for-proposed-warehouse-district/article_cc8e15f7-5202-564b-9878-9cf75832b5ce.html|title=Closer look: Rescue Mission details plans for proposed warehouse-district shelter|last=mike.smith@mtstandard.com|first=MIKE SMITH|work=Montana Standard|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless shelters in the United States typically allow the homeless to sleep at night, but do not allow individuals to stay in the shelter during the day. In Montana, missions are investing in day room facilities to allow the homeless to work on computers, dress, and prepare for interviews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One facility in Montana provides bunks as well as common areas and showers to help impoverished individuals get back on their feet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Contemporary day rooms==

Modern hotels fill daytime occupancy by offering day rooms. Day rooms are booked in a block of hours typically between 8 am and 5 pm,&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Darren|title=Long Layover? Many Airport Hotels Offer Day-Room Rates|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100324884|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=CNBC|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the typical night shift. For example, the Four Points, a [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel in [[Los Angeles]], began offering day rooms.&lt;ref name="CNBC" /&gt; Also, the [[Rodeway Inn and Suites]] near [[Port Everglades]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]] offers day rooms.&lt;ref name="Chris Cruises"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Chris|title=Pre-Cruise Hotels|url=https://chriscruises.com/pre-cruise-hotel-florida/|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=Chris Cruises|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

There is a technology movement surrounding travel and time-saving that implements daytime hotel use. Several companies offer mobile applications that divide the time by hours or day use for travel purposes.&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plautz|first1=Jessica|title=Startup aims to end the stigma of booking hotels by the hour|url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/10/hotel-room-day-rental/#Jorifl.TPkqE|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=Mashable|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Francisco]], a company has created a mobile application that divvies up time in a hotel by the minute.&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loizos|first1=Connie|title=Recharge lets you book a hotel room — for minutes at a time|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/recharge-lets-you-book-a-hotel-room-for-minutes-at-a-time/|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=Tech Crunch|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2016, new businesses are built around the concept of helping travelers find day rooms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The IT movement in this direction typically list hotels and motels that offer day room services and provide booking information for those facilities before evening bookings. Some companies that offer this service are Day Room Stay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gasteciyiz.biz/day-room-stay-completes-successful-sales-mission-to-china/|title=Day Room Stay Completes Successful Sales Mission to China – Gasteciyiz.biz|website=gasteciyiz.biz|language=tr-TR|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HotelsByDay|Hotels By Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/travel/2016/07/01/daycations-offer-hotel-experience-without-the-hefty-bill.html|title=‘Daycations’ offer hotel experience without the hefty bill {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Diminution''' is a [[satire|satirical]] technique. It reduces the size of something in order that it may be made to appear ludicrous, or in order to be closely examined. For example, if the Canadian Members of Parliament are portrayed as squabbling, spoiled little boys and girls, this would be diminution. A diminutive satire is ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

'''Eglinton Castle''' was a large Gothic castellated mansion in [[Kilwinning]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].

==History==

===The castle===
[[Image:Eglintoncastle1876.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Tournament Bridge and castle in 1876&lt;ref name="Dobie"&gt;Dobie, James (1876). ''Pont's Cuninghame'' Pub. John Tweed.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Eglinton castle (old).jpg|thumb|190px|right|Eglintoune castle from the south, prior to the rebuild of 1805]]
The ancient seat of the [[Earl of Eglinton|Earls of Eglinton]], it is located just south of the town of [[Kilwinning]]. The original Eglinton Castle was burnt by the [[Earl of Glencairn]] in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). ''Collins Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia''. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 278 - 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The current castle was built between 1797 and 1802 in Gothic [[castellated]] style dominated by a central {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} large round [[keep]] and four {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} outer towers, it was second only to [[Culzean Castle]] in appearance and grandeur. The foundation stone of the new Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning was laid in 1797, the 12th Earl of Eglinton, was proud to have the ceremony performed by Alexander Hamilton of [[Kerelaw House|Grange]], grandfather of the American Hero [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/450posteric.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/default.htm&amp;usg=__mIQHTNpIt-5W7ywc3whs7VG1lEU=&amp;h=153&amp;w=450&amp;sz=21&amp;hl=en&amp;start=39&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=QO0c96naJtfSFM:&amp;tbnh=43&amp;tbnw=127&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DEarl%2Bof%2BEglinton%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DN%26start%3D20%26um%3D1 Kilwinning Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eglinton was the most notable post-Adam Georgian castle in Ayrshire.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;Sanderson, Maragaret H. B. (1993), ''Robert Adam in Ayrshire''. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc. Monograph No. 11. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many items of interest, the castle contained a chair built from the oak timbers of [[Alloway]] kirk and the back of the chair was inlaid with a brass plaque which bore the whole of Burns' poem ''Tam o' Shanter''.&lt;ref name ="Alloway"&gt;Aikman, J. &amp; Gordon, W. (1839) An Account of the Tournament at Eglinton. Pub. Hugh Paton, Carver &amp; Gilder. Edinburgh. M.DCCC.XXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; This was sold at an auction in 1925.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"&gt;Dowells Ltd. ''Catalogue of the Superior Furnishings, French Furniture, etc.'' Tuesday, 1 December 1925, and four following days.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Eglington castle (sic) was described circa 1563–1566 as a ''fare castell, but noo strength againsts any power.''&lt;ref name="Arch Ayr Wigton"&gt;''Military Report on the Districts of Carrick, Kyle &amp; Cunningham.'' Archaeological &amp; Historical Collections relating to Ayr &amp; Wigton. 1884. Vol. IV. Pub. Ayr &amp; Wigton Arch Assoc. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; An escape tunnel is said to run from the old castle to the area of the rockery on the castle lawns. The appearance of the old waterfall may have inspired this story as it looks like a sealed doorway.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, Allison (2008), Five Roads / Corsehillhead resident.&lt;/ref&gt; The total acreage of the Earl of Eglinton's holdings was 34,716 Scots Acres (1 Scots acre = 1.5 English Acres) in 1788.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;National Archives of Scotland. RHP35796/1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This included Little Cumbrae, and lands at Southannan and Eaglesham (Polnoon).

The original castle of Eglinton may have been near Kidsneuk, Bogside (NS 309 409) where a substantial earth mound or motte stands and excavated pottery was found tentatively dating the site to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Anne Turner and Stevenson, Sylvia (1980), Historic Irvine the archaeological implications of development. Scottish Burgh Survey. Dept. Archaeology, Univ Glasgow. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montgomerys' first holdings were the Barony of [[Eaglesham]] and its [[Polnoon Castle|Castle of Polnoon]].
[[File:Scotia Depicta - Eglinton Castle -Plate-.jpg|300px|thumb|Etching of Eglinton Castle by [[James Fittler]] in Scotia Depicta published 1804]]
In 1691 the 'Hearth Tax for Ayrshire' records show 25 hearths in use, the highest number for a single dwelling in Ayrshire. It is noted that the earl had not paid the tax. The earl's house in Kilwinning, Easter Chambers or the old abbot's dwelling, had 15 hearths. Thirty-seven other dwellings were listed within the barony of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"&gt;Urquhart, Page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The stables were built from stones taken from the Easter Chambers of Kilwinning Abbey; being the Abbots lodgings and later that of the Earls of Eglinton. In 1784, over a period of four months, the building was demolished and the stones were taken to Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the new castle was not universally accepted as beneficial; Fullarton records that "The hoary grandeur of the old fortalice lay deeply buried amid the dense groves of immemorial growth which closely invested and obscured it; no innovating projects of improvement, nor change of any kind, had ever been permitted to disturb the sanctity of its seclusion, or to ruffle the feelings even of the most fastiduous worshipper of things as they are, or, more properly perhaps, chance to be".&lt;ref&gt;Fullarton, Page 85&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is said to have had a moat.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Covenating times====
In the 1640s [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] had been sent by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Neil Montgomery of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] negotiated a 4,000 merks penalty for the Eglinton Estates; three tenants having already been killed, with some deer and sheep also taken from the park.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior. Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society. {{ISBN|0-85411-059-3}}. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ley tunnels====
Persistent rumours exist of a [[Ley tunnel]] which is said to run from Kilwinning Abbey, under the 'Bean Yaird', below the 'Easter Chaumers' and the 'Leddy firs', and then underneath the Garnock and on to Eglinton Castle. No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries which does exist under the old abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A ley or an escape tunnel is also said to run from the castle to exit at the old waterfall near the rockery. It is reported that a tunnel ran from the castle to near the existing Castle Bridge. This tunnel was stone lined and tall enough for a man to walk through. This is likely to have been the main drain from the castle.

===The Pleasure gardens===

[[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1636 describes the landscape on his journey south from Glasgow as "a barren and poor country", but the earls had clearly enhanced Eglinton for he comments that the land at Irvine was "dainty, pleasant, level, champaign country."&lt;ref&gt;Brereton&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglinton Temple, Kilwinning, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Temple which the Countess of Eglinton had proposed for the Belvidere Hill.]]

The grounds of the castle were described in one record of the 1840s as follows:

''Its princely gates soon presented themselves and we thought we should easily find our way to Irvine through the park. It was a rich treat to wander in these extensive grounds. We soon made way through a handsome avenue to the gardens. The hot-houses for fruits and flowers are on a magnificent scale, and on reaching the parterre we were delighted with the elegance which pervaded it. A glassy river with a silvery cascade came gliding gently through these fairy regions, as though conscious of the luxuriant paradise which it was watering. Nor was the classic taste wanting, nor horticultural skill, to render this a region of enchantment. Two elegant cast-iron bridges, vases, statues, a sun-dial; these pretty combinations from the world of art could not fail to please the beholder. Leaving these luxurious regions we again wandered among thick woods, and occasionally obtained glimpses of the proud castle, peering over the trees. At length we found our way to a seat beneath some noble weepers of the ash tribe, and here we had a fine view of the castle, towering majestically over the dense foliage.''
[[File:Map of Dunduff castle &amp; roads.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Ayrshire by William Aiton, 1811]]
''Among our wanderings we passed an enormous quadrangular building, resembling some of our London hospitals. It forms the stables, and it is quite detached, at some distance from the Castle. We mistook our way, owing to the many devious paths, and wandered deeper and deeper into the recesses of this extensive domain. In passing through one long avenue, which was so dark that we were unable to see our steps; myriads of rooks took flight at our approach, and the air was quite blackened with them. At one time, we found ourselves walking alongside of the preserves, at another we were wandering in the deer park, and startling the early slumbers of these pretty creatures. At length we reached a gate, which we fully expected would lead into the high road to Irvine: but, to our great consternation, we found it was the point from which several roads diverged, each, apparently, leading into a thick forest, and it was evident that we had much space yet to traverse ere we could be clear of the extensive grounds of Eglintoun.''&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pages 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service quotes a verse pertaining to the Eglinton Woods:

The Guid Wee Green Folk

Doon by the Lugton,&lt;br&gt;
In Eglinton Woods,&lt;br&gt;
In blue-bell and foxglove,&lt;br&gt;
In the faulded up buds,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they bide,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they troke,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they hide -&lt;br&gt;
The guid wee green folk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Service, Page 181&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

A mention in Badderley's 'Through Guide' circa 1890 indicates that the Eglinton Castle grounds were open to the public on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter (1989), Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable trees====
The 'Fauna, Flora and Geology of the Clyde Area'&lt;ref&gt;Scott Elliot, G. F., Laurie, M. and Murdoch, J. B. (1901). Glasgow: British Association. pages 131–147.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the notable Clyde Area trees at Eglinton in 1901, showing that the estate at the time had one of the foremost collection of significant trees in southern Scotland. Tree removal for sale as timber was one of the first acts of the new owners of the estate when it was sold in the late 1940s, however many had already been removed in 1925 by Neill of Prestwick and Howie of Dunlop, both being timber merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant trees were:- Holly (6' 10'' girth); Sycamore (13' 2'' girth – Deer Park); Field Maple (6' 5'' girth); Horse Chestnut (11' 4'' girth); Gean (girth 11' girth – Bullock Park); Hawthorn (8' 3'' girth); Fraxinus heterophylla (4' 6'' girth – Lady Jane's Cottage); Elm (12' 7' girth – castle); Hornbeam (14' girth – between Castle &amp; Mains); Holly Oak (5' 2'' girth – gardens); Sweet Chestnut (16' girth – Bullock Park); Beech (18' 3'' girth – Old Wood); Cut-leaved Beech (8' 11'' girth); Larch (8' 9'' girth); Cedar of Lebanon (9' 11'' girth – Bullock Park); Scots Pine (11' girth – between Castle and Mains).

===The Eglinton Tournament===
Eglinton is best remembered for the lavish, if ill-fated [[Eglinton Tournament]], a [[medieval]]-style [[tournament]] organised in 1839 by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl]]. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style torrential rain washed the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as [[jousting]]. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoléon III of France|Napoléon III of the French]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ker, Page 318&lt;/ref&gt;

===The demise of the castle===
[[Image:Robertsonscunn2.jpg|thumb|200px|Robertson's map of the 1820s showing a lochan at Eglinton Castle.]]
The immense cost of upkeep, the poor condition of the castle and death duties took their toll on the family finances; the castle was abandoned in 1925. De-roofed in 1926, the lead being removed and sold,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt; after a house contents sale in December 1925, and progressively ruinous, the building finally came to an undignified end during the [[Second World War]] when it was seriously damaged during [[British Army|army]] training held there. The army also partly destroyed the iron bridge running to the old walled gardens.

The 1925 house sale by Dowell's Limited, included 1,960 items auctioned, raising £7,004 19s 6d. The auction catalogue provides an interesting insight into the feelings of the family at this sad time, with much of the Montgomerie history sold off, such as the 13th Earl's suit of armour from the tournament, the panel from the door of the murdered 10th Earl's coach and many paintings of the family and the castle, including a portrait of that great beauty, Susanna Kennedy, Countess of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"/&gt; The family moved to [[Skelmorlie Castle]] near [[Largs]] in 1925.

Architects drawings from March 1930 survive for plans to adapt the stable buildings as a residence for the Earl of Eglinton and Winton.&lt;ref name="Eglinton Archive"&gt;Eglinton Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial remains of the castle survived WW2, however the buildings were rationalised in 1973 and only one main tower was kept, together with some outer wall, foundations and parts of the castle wings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Page 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Eglinton Castle is said by one of the gardeners to have had a room which was never opened. In about 1925 a young man from Kilwinning decided to take some of the panelling from a room in the castle as it was all being allowed to rot in the rain anyway, the roof had been removed. He went the castle to take away as much as he could carry, however one of the last pieces he selected left exposed the skeletal hand of a woman. The whole skeleton was later removed by a student doctor, but for fear of prosecution the matter was never reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomeries of Eglinton, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eglinton family micro-history==
[[File:Sophia, Countess of Eglinton, Memorial.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Memorial to Lady Sophia Montgomerie, wife of the 14th Earl]]

In 1583 Lady Anne Montgomerie brought her husband, Lord Semple, a dowry of 6000 [[merks]], a considerable sum.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Frances Montgomerie was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in Edinburgh on 11 May 1797. She was the daughter of Archibald, 12th Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="DanielA"&gt;Daniel, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the coronation of [[Charles I of Great Britain|Charles I]] at Holyrood, the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of bearing the king's spurs.&lt;ref name="DanielB"&gt;Daniel, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glasgow University]]'s Eglinton Arts Fellowship was established in 1862 by subscription to commemorate the public services of Archibald William, 13th Earl of Eglinton, Rector of the University 1852–54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf Glasgow University Art's Fellowship.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011075845/http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the christening of King James IV the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of carrying the salt.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potato was first heard of in Scotland in 1701; it was not popular at first. In 1733 it is however recorded as being eaten at supper by the Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huchoun]] ("little Hugh") or Huchown is a poet conjectured to have been writing sometime in the 14th century. Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858–1923), have identified him with Hugh of Eglington, and advanced his authorship of several other significant pieces of verse.

[[Viva Seton Montgomerie]] records that a gipsy put a curse on the Montgomerie family that for three generations the property would not go from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the family crest is unclear, however a link may exist with the popular biblical story of an [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general of Nebuchadnezzar. The general laid siege to Bethulia, and the city almost surrendered. It was saved by Judith, a beautiful Hebrew widow who entered Holofernes's camp, seduced, and then beheaded Holofernes while he was drunk. She returned to Bethulia with Holofernes head, and the Hebrews subsequently defeated the enemy. Judith is considered as a symbol of liberty, virtue, and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause.

===Eglinton Country Park===

{{main|Eglinton Country Park}}

In the 1970s plans were made to open the extensive grounds (988 acres) around the ruins to the public, and to that end what remained of the structure was made safe by demolishing all but a wing facade and a single tower. Eglinton Country Park is now fully established with free entry and is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Ayrshire.

Eglinton Estate was in disrepair until Robert Clement Wilson purchased the grounds and built a meat canning factory in what was the old stable block. He also restored the grounds to their former splendour at his own expense. The canning factory, which supplied all the major multiples{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, closed following the BSE crises in 1996.

In 1963 [[Ian Anstruther]] wrote an entertaining account of the 1839 tournament entitled ''The Knight and the Umbrella''.

===Estate features===

====Lady Susanna's Cottage====
[[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna Montgomerie]], wife of the 9th Earl of Eglinton, was a renowned society beauty and her husband built for her at Kidsneuk a copy of the [[Hameau de la Reine]] 'cottage orné' that [[Marie Antoinette]] had famously possessed at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]]. This building, now a golf clubhouse, was thatched until the 1920s and is built of whin with steeply pitched roof sections and many gables.&lt;ref&gt;Close (2012), Page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dower houses====
The tradition was that a dowager countess would move out of the Earl's ancestral seat and move to a lesser dwelling. The [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna]], wife of the 9th Earl, moved to Kilmaurs House and then to Auchans Castle for instance. Over the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"&gt;Fullarton, Page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilmaurs Place|Kilmaurs House]], [[Auchans Castle, Ayrshire|Auchans Castle]] and Redburn House were some of the dower houses used.

====The Rackets Hall====

Eglinton has a 'Racket Hall' which was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The court floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racquet court, built before the court size was standardised and is now the oldest surviving court in the World, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;Eglinton Country Park archive&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 the earl employed a rackets professional, John Mitchell and Patrick Devitt replaced him. Mitchell owned a pub in Bristol with its own rackets court and this was named the "Eglinton Arms", having been the "Sea Horse" previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ashford, P. K. (1994). Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt;

====Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet====
A croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between the castle and the Lugton Water, also the old site of the marquee for the tournament banquet. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the hoops 'to ring the changes' and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist. It is not known why the earl named it thus.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park - falconer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lady Ha'====
The Montgomerie family are said to have had a pre-reformation chapel in the Weirston - Lady Ha' area dedicated to Saint Issyn. A 'Ladiehall' dwelling still existed in 1691, occupied by John and James Weir. Two other 'Weir' families also lived on the estate.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

==Estate microhistory==

===Lady Egidia===
The "Egidia" was one of the largest, if not the largest wooden vessels ever built in Scotland. She measured 219 feet long, extreme breadth 37 feet, depth 22 feet, registered tonnage 1,235, builders measurements 1,461 tons. Lady Egidia was the daughter of the Earl of Eglinton. The Earl launched her at Ardrossan in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html The Ships List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930053937/http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html |date=2011-09-30 }} Retrieved: 2011-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pavilion===
In the early 1900s, the Earl of Eglinton and Winton had a summer residence called the Pavilion at 1 South Crescent Road, Ardrossan. It was built at the beginning of the previous century. In the 1920s the Pavilion, two lodges, stables and walled garden in 3.4 acres of ground were sold to the Roman Catholic Church on 30 January 1924 for £4500. The pavilion was demolished and the present day church and manse built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpeterinchains.net/ St Peter in Chains] Retrieved: 2010-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===White or Chillingham Cattle===
In 1759 the Earl of Eglinton formed a herd of the ancient breed of White or [[Chillingham Cattle]] at [[Ardrossan]], probably using stock from the [[Cadzow Castle|Cadzow herd]]. The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in this herd were hornless.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garden or Easter Chambers===
After the destruction of the main buildings at [[Kilwinning Abbey]] the Garden or Easter Chambers within the boundary walls of the old abbey, previously the dwelling of the abbot were used by the new owners, the Earls of Eglinton, as a dower house and family dwelling. Lady Mary Montgomerie lived here after the death of her husband in the 17th century and her son may have remained here until he succeeded to the Earldom. The building, which stood to the south of the abbey, was eventually demolished in 1784 and the stones used in building projects at the castle, particularly the stable offices.&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"/&gt; The 1691 Hearth Tax records show that this substantial building had 15 hearths.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

===Daft Will Speirs===
A well known Ayrshire eccentric, Will had been a high spirited youth, punished by being hung over the edge of a bridge over the River Garnock whilst it was in flood, resulting in a form of nervous breakdown which left him as a likeable character, accepted by most and a regular visitor to many a laird or earl's estates. Will died at Corsehillmuir whilst going from Bannoch to Moncur, falling into an old mine shaft whilst trying to rescue a collie dog.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Pages 42 - 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Buffalo Park===
An area below the old Mains Farm was known as the 'Buffalo Park' and this may relate to the 11th Earl having been involved in the British army's subdugation of the [[Cherokee]] Indians in North America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Irish Giant===
John Service relates an Ayrshire legend that an Irish Giant came to mock the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith who lived near [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]] and the laird chased him across to Eglinton where the giant went to crush him with a great beech tree. The laird pierced him through the arm bones with his sword and the giants hand remained attached to the tree for centuries. It could be seen from a distance of about a mile - from Kilwinning, between Dykehead and the Redburn.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vagrants and the unemployed===
In 1662 the Earl was given the rights to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to [[Montgomerieston]] at the Citadel of Ayr where the Earl had a wool factory. The parishes had to support them whilst there and the Earl only had to provide food and clothing. The rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauchland, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Covenant===
A painting by W. Hole RSA of the 1638 ''Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Churchyard'' features the Earl of Eglinton in the crowd, just prior to his putting his signature to the document.

===Lady Jane's Cottage===
A similar style of cottage existed at Kidsneuk and on the [[Crosbie Castle and the Fullarton estate|Fullarton estate]] in [[Troon]] as a lodge house near the Crosbie Kirk ruins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-115-409-C Heather House, Troon. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; Lilliput Lane has produced a model of Lady Jane's cottage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrsaville.co.uk/ll_Scotland_NV.htm Lilliput Lane - Scottish models. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; An ash of the species Fraxinus heterophylla of 4' 6'' girth – once grew at Lady Jane's Cottage.

===Cigarette Cards===
The castle and bridge were featured in the series on castles, abbeys and houses by Salmon &amp; Gluckstein Ltd.

===Annick School===
The Earl of Eglinton built a large schoolroom and a house for the teacher at Annick near [[Lands of Doura|Doura]]; he also provided a garden and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The building ceased to be a school and was used as a cafe for a few years before being adapted to become private accommodation.

===Hare Coursing===
The Ardrossan Hare Coursing Club used to pursue hares on Ardrossan Hill in the 1840s and would then return to Eglinton Castle for refreshments provided by the 13th Earl. This bloodsport finally became illegal in Scotland in 2002. A famous greyhound owned by Lord Eglinton was named 'Heather Jock' after a colourful local character of that name.

===Religion===
In the 1622 persecution the minister of Irvine, Mr David Duckson, was banished, however the earl had him returned to his charge. [[Anne Livingstone|Anne, Countess of Eglinton]], daughter of [[Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow]], was very religious, and Eglinton was a safe haven for persecuted ministers. She took an interest in the [[Stewarton|Stewarton Revival]] and invited some of the adherents to meet the earl and the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century the Montgomerie's of Eglinton were supporters of the Scottish Episcopalian church and the Rev W. S. Wilson travelled to the castle on Sunday afternoons to conduct services. The earl granted a piece of land in Ardrossan with a nominal feu duty to the church and his countess laid the church foundation stone on 30 November 1874; it opened in 1875 and consecrated in 1882 by Bishop Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farms===
Aiton in 1811 records that nearly all the farms on the extensive estates of the 10th Earl of Eglinton were ''elegant, commodious, and substantial.''&lt;ref&gt;Aiton, Page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montgomerystown===
Ayr citadel, later called the Fort, was constructed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 with stones taken from the Earl's castle at Ardrossan. It occupied an area of about 12 acres, on a hexagonal ground plan, with bastions at the angles, and enclosed the church of St John the Baptist, converted by Cromwell into an armoury and guard-room. After Cromwell's time it was dismantled and the ground it occupied, together with its buildings, presented to the Earl of Eglinton as compensation for losses sustained during the Great Rebellion. Renamed [[Montgomerieston|Montgomerystown]], it was created a burgh of regality, and became the seat of a considerable trade, including a family owned brewery. In 1726 it was purchased by four merchants from the town, and circa 1870, most of it covered with high quality housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory478.html Gazetteer for Scotland] Retrieved: 2011-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early automobile accident===
In 1911, a motor van belonging to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out and two of them were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the injured parties taken to Beith in his car. The injured parties were treated for head and body injuries after which they were driven to Lugton and entrained for Kilmarnock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ Early automobile accident] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705134715/http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ |date=2010-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rozelle===
Archibald Hamilton, a younger son of John Hamilton of Sundrum, married Lady Jane Montgomerie of Coilsfield (his cousin), daughter of the 12th Earl of Eglinton and doting aunt to the 13th Earl of Eglinton. The 13th earl gave the couple a life-rent interest in the mansion house of Rozelle. The estate of Rozelle (formerly Rosel) had been part of the lands of the Barony of Alloway. The future estate was purchased by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, his uncle, a former Jamaica merchant who named it after a Jamaican property and also built the mansion house (1760). Archibald Hamilton rebuilt the house in the 1830s to designs by the architect David Bryce and in 1837 he purchased the Rozelle estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; SCRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224917/http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; |date=2011-10-03 }} Retrieved: 2011-08-21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental politics''' designate both the [[politics]] about the [[Natural environment|environment]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dobson, ''Environmental Politics: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-966557-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[environmental policy]]) and an [[academic field]] of study focused on three core components:&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;Carter, Neil. 2007. ''The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy'', 2nd ed. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-68745-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The study of [[Political science|political]] [[Social theory|theories]] and [[Political philosophy|ideas]] related to the [[natural environment|environment]];
* The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream [[political party|political parties]] and [[environmental movement|environmental social movements]]; and
* The analysis of [[public policy]]making and [[public administration|implementation]] affecting the environment, at multiple [[geopolitics|geo-political]] [[Level of analysis|levels]].

Neil Carter, in his foundational text ''Politics of the Environment'' (2009), suggests that ''environmental'' politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (page 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., ''Greening the Millenium?'', 1997).&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular [[conservation movement|conservationism]] and [[Wilderness#Preservation|preservationism]]. Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern [[environmentalism]] was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society."&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Environmental concerns were rooted in the vast social changes that took place in the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and [[water pollution]] and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Samuel P., and Barbara D. Hays. Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955-1985. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of environmentalism in the United Kingdom emerged in this period following the great London smog of 1952 and the Torrey Canyon oil spill of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/21603/&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the emergence of [[Green politics]] in the Western world beginning in the 1970s.

== Democratic challenges ==
Climate change is slow relative to political cycles of leadership in [[Electoral system|electoral democracies]], which impedes responses by politicians who are elected and re-elected on much shorter timescales.&lt;ref name=Guerrero&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative|last = Guerrero|first = Alexander|date = 2014|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, although "environmentalism" was once considered a White phenomenon, scholars have identified "pro-environment positions among Latino, African-American, and non-Hispanic white respondents," with growing environmental concern especially among Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Matthew, Segura, and Bowler, Shaun (2005). "Racial/Ethnic Group Attitudes Toward Environmental Protection in California: Is "Environmentalism" Still a White Phenomenon?" ''Political Research Quarterly'' (58)3: pp. 435, 435-447.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have similarly noted that Asian Americans are strongly pro-environmental, with some variation among ethnic subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Paul, Le, Loan and Daniels, Paula (2013) "Ethnic Variation in Environmental Attitudes and Opinion among Asian American Voters." ''AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community'' (11)1-2: pp. 91-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively responding to [[global warming]] necessitates some form of international [[environmental governance]] to achieve shared targets related to energy consumption and environmental usage.&lt;ref name=Edmondson&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Change and Order|last = Edmondson and Levy|first = |publisher = |year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change complicates political ideology and practice, affecting conceptions of responsibility for future societies as well as economic systems.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Material inequality between nations make technological solutions insufficient for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Rather, political solutions can navigate the particularities of various facets of environmental crisis. Climate change mitigation strategies can be at odds with democratic priorities of prosperity, progress, and state sovereignty, and instead underscore a collective relationship with the environment.

The international political community is presently based on liberal principles that prioritize individual freedoms and capitalist systems that make quick and ambitious climate responses difficult.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; [[Interest group liberalism|Interest-group liberalism]] is guided by individual human priorities.&lt;ref name=Baber&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deliberative Environmental Politics|last = Baber and Bartlett|first = |publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups unable to voice their self-interest, such as minorities without suffrage, or non-humans, are not included in the political compromise. Addressing environmental crises can be impeded when citizens of liberal democracies do not see environmental problems as impacting their lives, or when they lack the education to evaluate the importance of the problem.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/alterlj16&amp;div=48&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|title = Democracy and the Ecological Crisis|last = Mathews|first = Freya|date = 1991|journal = Legal Service Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human benefits from environmental exploitation and protection compete.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Considering the implications of ecological degradation for future human generations can give environmental concerns a basis in anthropocentric liberal democratic politics.

[[William Ophuls]] posits that liberal democracies are unfit to address environmental problems, and that the prioritization of these challenges would involve a transition to more authoritarian forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity |last= Ophuls |first= William |authorlink= William Ophuls |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company |year=1977 |isbn= |location= San Francisco|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this by pointing to the past successes of environmental reform movements to improve water and air quality in liberal societies.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; In practice, environmentalism can improve democracy rather than necessitate its end, by expanding democratic participation and promoting political innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democracy, Bureaucracy and Environmentalism|last = Paehlke|first = Robert| author-link= Robert C. Paehlke|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Environmental Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between liberal democracy and environmental goals raise questions about the possible limitations of democracy (or at least democracy as we know it): in its responsiveness to subtle but large-scale problems, its ability to work from a holistic societal perspective, its aptness in coping with environmental crisis relative to other forms of government.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Democracies do not have the provisions to make environmental reforms that are not mandated by voters, and many voters lack incentives or desire to demand policies that could compromise immediate prosperity. The question arises as to whether the foundation of politics is morality or practicality.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; A scheme that conceives of and values the environment beyond its human utility, an [[environmental ethics]], could be crucial for democracies to respond to climate change.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt;

== Alternative forms of democracy for environmental policy ==
In political theory, [[deliberative democracy]] has been discussed as a political model more compatible with environmental goals. Deliberative democracy is a system in which informed political equals weigh values, information, and expertise, and debate priorities to make decisions, as opposed to a democracy based on interest aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the People Speak|last = Fishkin|first = James|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of democracy emphasizes informed discussion among citizens in the decision making process, and encourages decisions to benefit the common good rather than individual interests.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson claimed that reason prevails over self-interest in deliberative democracy, making it a more just system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7869.html|title = Why Deliberative Democracy|date = 2004|accessdate = |website = Princeton University Press|publisher = |last = Gutmann and Thompson|first = Amy and Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad perspective that this discursive model encourages could lead to a stronger engagement with environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt;

In political theory, the lottery system is a democratic design that allows governments to address problems with future, rather than immediate, impacts. Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected representatives can draft environmental policies that have short-term costs without considering the political consequences for re-election.&lt;ref name=Guerrero/&gt;

== New materialism and environmental justice ==
New materialism is a strain of thought in philosophy and the social sciences that conceives of all material as having life or agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics|last = Coole and Frost|first = |publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticizes frameworks of justice that center on human attributes like consciousness as insufficient for modern ethical problems that concern the natural environment. It is a post-humanist consideration of all matter that rejects arguments of utility that privilege humans. This politically relevant social theory combats inequality beyond the interpersonal plane.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isle.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/1.extract|title = Marxism and Ecocriticism|last = Newman|first = Lance|date = 2002|journal = Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People are ethically responsible for one another, and for the physical spaces they navigate, including animal and plant life, and the inanimate matter that sustains it, like soil. New materialism encourages political action according to this world vision, even if it is incompatible with economic growth.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

[[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]] uses the term "vital materialism" in her book ''Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things''. She develops the concept of materialism with the aim of providing a stronger basis in political theory for environmental politics.

New materialists have invoked [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and other historical thinkers to trace the emergence of their philosophy and to justify their environmental claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies|last = Dolphijn and van der Tuin|first = Rick and Iris|publisher = Open Humanities Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"No justice ... seems possible or thinkable without the principle of some responsibility, beyond all living present, within that which disjoins the living present, before the ghosts of those who are not yet born or who are already dead [...]. Without this non-contemporaneity with itself of the living present ... without this responsibility and this respect for justice concerning those who are not there, of those who are no longer or who are not yet present and living, what sense would there be to ask the question 'where?' 'where tomorrow?' 'whither?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International|last = Derrida|first = Jacques|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = |location = New York and London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;All material, living and dead, is interrelated in "the mesh" as described by [[Timothy Morton]]. As all matter is interdependent, humans have obligations to all parts of the material world, including those that are unfamiliar.

New materialism is related to a shift from the view of the environment as a form of capital to a form of labor (see [[Ecosystem services]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anti.12125/epdf|title = Beyond The Limits to Growth: Ecology and the Neoliberal Counterrevolution|last = Holiday|first = Sara Nelson|date = 2015|journal = Antipode|doi = 10.1111/anti.12125|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging nations ==
Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the "[[BRICS|BRIC]]" nations) are rapidly industrializing, and are increasingly responsible for global carbon emissions and the associated climate change. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}} Other forms of [[environmental degradation]] have also accompanied the economic growth in these nations.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |title=Will Emerging Economies Repeat the Environmental Mistakes of their Rich Cousins? |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate= |website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher= |last=Shaw |first=William |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095237/http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation tends to motivate action more than the threat of global warming does, since air and water pollution cause immediate health problems, and because pollutants can damage natural resources, hampering economic potential.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|The Kuznets curve is a hypothetical curve representing the trajectory of environmental degradation in developing nations as a function of per capita income.|322x322px]]
With rising incomes, environmental degradation tends to decrease in industrializing nations, as depicted in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (described in a section of the [[Kuznets curve|Kuznets Curve]] article). Citizens demand better air and water quality, and technology becomes more efficient and clean when incomes increase.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; The level of income per capita needed to reverse the trend of environmental degradation in industrializing nations varies with the environmental impact indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://isecoeco.org/pdf/stern.pdf|title = The Environmental Kuznets Curve|date = June 2003|accessdate = |website = The International Society for Ecological Economics|publisher = |last = Stern|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; More developed nations can facilitate eco-friendly transitions in emerging economies by investing in the development of clean technologies. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}}

Laws implemented in response to environmental concerns vary by nation (see [[List of environmental laws by country]]).

=== China ===
China's environmental ills include acid rain, severe smog, and a reliance on coal-burning for energy.&lt;ref name=Economy&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-environmental-challenge-political-social-economic-implications/p5573|title = China's Environmental Challenge: Political, Social and Economic Implications|date = 27 January 2003|accessdate = |website = Council on Foreign Relations|publisher = |last = Economy|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has instated environmental policies since the 1970s, and has one of the most extensive environmental conservation programs on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9701.2007.00883.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|title = China's Environment: Problems and Policies|last = MacBean|first = Alasdair|date = 2007|journal = The World Economy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, regulation and enforcement by the central government in Beijing are weak, so solutions are decentralized. Wealthier provinces are far more effective in their preservation and sustainable development efforts than poorer regions.&lt;ref name=Economy/&gt; China therefore provides an example of the consequences of environmental damage falling disproportionately on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ifad.org/events/past/hunger/envir.html|title = Combating Environmental Degradation|date = |accessdate = |website = Investing in Rural People|publisher = International Fund for Agricultural Development|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs, the media, and the international community have all contributed to China's response to environmental problems.&lt;ref name=Economy/&gt;

For history, laws, and policies, see [[Environmental policy in China]].

=== India ===
In 1976, the [[Constitution of India]] was amended to reflect environmental priorities, motivated in part by the potential threat of natural resource depletion to economic growth:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife." (Art. 48A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India [...] to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures." (Art. 51A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in India, as in China, the implementation of written environmental policies, laws, and amendments has proven challenging. Official legislation by the central government (see a partial list at [[Environmental policy of the Government of India]]) is often more symbolic than practical.&lt;ref name=Dembowski&gt;{{Cite book|title = Taking the State to Court: Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India|last = Dembowski|first = Hans|publisher = Asia House|year = 2001|isbn = |location = online|pages = 63–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] was established in 1985, but corruption within bureaucratic agencies, namely the influence of wealthy industry leaders, limited any attempts at enforcement of the policies put in place.&lt;ref name=Dembowski/&gt;

In [[textual criticism]], an '''exemplar''' is the text used to produce another text. In the study of the history of a text an especially important exemplar is that which precedes any split in the tradition of that text, that is, before significant textual variations occur in different versions--such an exemplar is called an [[Archetype (disambiguation)|archetype]].

'''Fat fetishism''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]] people due to their weight and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/t-magazine/22face-merkin-t.html|title=The F Word|first=Daphne|last=Merkin|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-excess/201506/the-fat-fetish-explained|title=The Fat Fetish, Explained|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of fat fetishism is ''feederism'' or ''gaining'', where sexual gratification is obtained not from the fat itself but from the process of gaining, or helping others gain, [[body fat]]. Fat fetishism also incorporates ''stuffing'' and ''padding'', whereas the focus of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] is on the sensations and properties of a real or ''simulated'' gain.

==Attraction==
[[File:Fa attraction.svg|thumb|Physical attraction of 47 male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] (FA, in red) towards 10 female figures from the given [[Body mass index|BMI]] range, compared with a control group (CG, in blue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224490802645302| pmid = 19116865| title = Big Beautiful Women: The Body Size Preferences of Male Fat Admirers| journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]]| volume = 46| issue = 1| pages = 89–96| year = 2009| last1 = Swami | first1 = V. | last2 = Tovée | first2 = M. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A 2009 study found that heterosexual male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that [[fat admiration|FAs]] are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|author2=Tovee, Martin J.|title=Big beautiful women: the body size preferences of male fat admirers.|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2009|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Big+beautiful+women:+the+body+size+preferences+of+male+fat+admirers-a0196534094|accessdate=25 November 2010|doi=10.1080/00224490802645302|volume=46|pages=89–96|pmid=19116865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaining and feeding==
Gainers and feedees are people who enjoy the fantasy or reality of gaining weight themselves. Encouragers and feeders enjoy the fantasy of helping someone else gain weight. Gainer and encourager are common labels among gay men, while both straight men and women as well as lesbian women often identify as feeders and feedees.&lt;ref name="Bestard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bestard|first=Alyshia|title=Feederism: an exploratory study into the stigma of erotic weight gain.|journal=University of Waterloo Thesis Paper|date=September 2008|url=https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/3985|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gainers and feedees have a wide array of personal weight-gain goals--only 10 percent of gainers and 13 percent of feedees express interest in immobility as a fantasy or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.feabie.com/Home/Community|title=Feabie|website=Feabie|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grommr.com/Home/Community#gainer-report|title=Grommr|website=Grommr|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[gaining and feeding]] are often considered fetishes, many within the gainer and feederism communities report viewing them more as a lifestyle, identity or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Bestard"/&gt; 

The gay gainer community grew out of the [[Girth &amp; Mirth]] movement in the 70s. By 1988 there were gainer-specific newsletters and in 1992, the first gainer event, called EncourageCon, was held in New Hope, PA. In 1996, GainRWeb launched, the first website dedicated to gay men into weight gain, ushering in the internet era.&lt;ref name="Textor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Textor|first=Alex Robertson|title=Organization, Specialization, and Desires in the Big Men's Movement: Preliminary Research in the Study of Subculture-Formation.|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|date=July 1999|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023223013536|volume=4|pages=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist sexology''' is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. Sexology has a basis in psychoanalysis, specifically Freudian theory, which played a big role in early sexology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohler|first=Bertram J.|last2=Galatzer-Levy|first2=Robert M.|date=2008-01-03|title=Freud, Anna, and the Problem of Female Sexuality|journal=Psychoanalytic Inquiry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–26|doi=10.1080/07351690701787085|issn=0735-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reactionary field of feminist sexology seeks to be inclusive of experiences of sexuality and break down the problematic ideas that have been expressed by sexology in the past. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly.

==Themes==
Many of the topics that feminist sexologists study include (but are not limited to) [[reproductive rights]], [[sex work]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] identities, [[marriage]], [[pornography]] and [[gender roles]]. Much of the work within feminist sexology has been done within the last few decades, focusing on the movements of sexual liberation in the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of an easily handled and effective means of contraception, [[lesbian]] and transgender visibility, and the stronger waves of women taking charge of their lives. There has been much debate about whether the sexual revolution was really beneficial to women, if a pro-sex attitude can really be achieved within the context of Western society, but as new voices are lifted, layers of interpretation and knowledge can be gathered.

* Lesbianism - Lesbianism is a major theme of feminist sexology. Lesbian society and culture is one that is often over-looked by general society resulting in lesbian women being disregarded and ultimately ignored in public and professional spaces. In the workplace, for example, lesbian women are often still sexualized and forced to play the role of the ‘heterosexual female.’ Feminist theorist Adrienne Rich discusses this type of oppression in her article, “Compulsory Heterosexuality.” Adrienne Rich claims,
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Women endure sexual harassment to keep their jobs and learn to behave in a complacently and ingratiatingly heterosexual manner… the woman who too decisively resists sexual overtures in the workplace is accused of being ‘dried-up and sexless, or lesbian.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory heterosexuality and lesbian existence. ''Signs: Journal of women in culture and society'', ''5''(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The lesbian in society is of utmost importance in that she bears the weight of judgement and oppression on her shoulders for love and the progression of the woman. On page 649 of “Compulsory Heterosexuality” Rich writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Prostitution - In Gayle Rubin’s article “Thinking Sex,” Rubin discusses the shift of prostitution from a once socially acceptable occupation to a now isolated and reprimanded occupation in modern-day society. This shift in society perception known as the “modernization of sex.” The modernization of sex in the case of prostitution is defined as; the organization of sex groups such as prostitutes, homoesexuals, sadomasochists, etc. into localized populations. On page 156 of “Thinking Sex” Rubin regards the occupation of prostitution and its place in present-day society,
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“Sex work is an occupation… Prostitutes are a criminal sexual population stigmatized on the basis of sexual activity… Prostitutes are the primary prey of vice police.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Rubin, G. (1984). Thinking sex: Notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality. ''Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies; A Reader'', 100-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Anti-prostitution laws have also surfaced in recent years, dismantling prostitution in local jurisdictions and restricting various forms of sexual commerce. On page 163, Rubin writes how these actions are justified:
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“[These actions are] rationalized by portraying them as menaces to health and safety, women and children… or civilization itself. Even when activity is acknowledged to be harmless, it may be banned because it is alleged to ‘lead’ to something ostensibly worse.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Children and Sexuality

In her article “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality,” Gayle Rubin states that society teaches children about gender and sex; they know nothing about it when they are born, because gender and sex are socially constructed ideas.  Society teaches our children about social norms through actions. This models gender through behavior and children learn to act in a certain way depending if they are male or female.&lt;br /&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the idea of masturbation was considered to be a taboo and unhealthy practice.  What was thought of as premature sexual interest in a child was strongly discouraged, because sexual excitement of any kind was thought to damage the health and discourage the maturation of a child. In the past, parents have resorted to extreme measures to prevent children from masturbating, such as tying them down to keep from touching themselves or even making permanent surgical changes to their genitals. While these extreme measures have for the most part been abandoned in today’s society, the attitude that the idea of sex is harmful to children still endures. &lt;br /&gt;

According to Anne Fausto-Stearling, Infant Genital Surgery is a cosmetic surgery performed on infants who do not fit into a defined gender category (sometimes with or without the parent’s consent).  The surgery reshapes their sexual reproductive organs into either male or female gender binaries without considering the child’s wishes or what they may have chosen later in life.  This can lead to gender confusion and unhappiness as the child grows, and may even have a biological physical impact on how the child’s reproductive organs develop.

* Sex and Respectability
Gayle Rubin argues that modern society judges sex acts through their theoretical value.  She states that “Marital, reproductive heterosexuals are alone at the top erotic pyramid.”  This means that because the people engaging in sex are married, heterosexual, and the possibility of reproduction is present, the act of sex has a higher value in accordance with societal norms.  Unmarried heterosexual sex is also valued, but not as much. Monogamous, heteronormative lesbian and gay relationships are not quite as respected, but are considered to still be of minimal value. “The most despised sexual castes currently include transsexuals, transvestites, fetishists, sadomasochists, sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models...” Solitary sex acts, or masturbation, are not even considered a part of the hierarchy.  These sex acts are ordered in such a way because of their ability to reproduce and create children. “According to this system, sexuality that is ‘good’, ‘normal’, and ‘natural’ should ideally be heterosexual, marital, monogamous, reproductive, and non-commercial.”  Anything relating to sex that breaks these societally prescribed rules is considered to be “bad” and “unnatural,” such as homosexuality, fetish objects, the use of pornography, and casual sex, amongst others.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;“All these hierarchies of sexual value – religious, psychiatric, and popular – function in much the same ways as do ideological systems of racism, ethnocentrism, and religious chauvinism. They rationalize the well-being of the sexually privileged and the adversity of the sexual rabble.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influential thinkers==
* [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] - Fausto-Sterling, with a background in biology, has written several books on the subject of how gender interacts and is shaped by biology, society and culture. In her book, Sexing the Body, she takes a close look on how the definition of our sex and gender as a species by the society relegates our sexual identities and actions. She also tackles these subjects in her other works, including her books ''Myths of Gender'' and ''Love, Power and Knowledge'' (which she co-wrote with Hilary Rose.)
* [[Gayle Rubin]] - Rubin, a [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], focuses on many subjects, notably [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]] and [[sexual subcultures]]. She has been a strong voice in the "pro-sex" arena of sexology, debating strongly the intersection of [[sexual identity]] and societal structure in the 1980s, during which it was dubbed the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]." She also worked with [[Patrick Califia]] studying the gay [[Leather subculture|leather scene]].

==Three Main Points==

;Male power
Under the patriarchal culture of sexual desire, women are suppressed to express their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women’s fear of desire keeps them quiet and justify society’s belief that men have the power and authority in the relationships. Women are not allowed to express their sexual needs and male power is against masturbation.

While being taught to be conservative about sexual desire, women are also taught in a contradictory way that their bodies should be readily available for the pleasure of men without having a sexual voice. Sexology has a basis within psychology and the way the DSM-5 has categorized female sexual dysfunctions play into issues of male power over the sexuality of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chloë|date=2015|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction, Feminist Sexology, and the Psychiatry of the Normal|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=41|issue=2|pages=259–292|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel, K. (2010). The history of ‘female sexual dysfunction’ as a mental disorder in the 20th century. ''Current opinion in psychiatry,'' ''23''(6), 536.&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sexual dysfunction among women, most are categorized as the woman having lowered sexual desire that causes “personal distress” over a period of time. Often times, the personal distress that women are feeling is due to relationship problems, and an irritated partner from the lack of sexual desire. “Women are diagnosed and treated as sexually disordered because they have sex-related marital tensions, even if they are personally well adjusted to their sexual response.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DSM-5 fails to recognize other reasons a woman may not want to engage in sexually activity, and does not talk about “sexual communication, emotion, whole body experience, taboo and danger, commitment, attraction, sexual knowledge, safety, respect, feelings about bodies, breast cycles, pregnancy, contraception or getting old.” Furthermore, the sexual sciences do not necessarily repress female sexuality as they base it on heteronormative masculinity without giving women a voice about their own sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women not having a voice about their own sexuality is a highly recognized problem in various fields of feminist theory. In “The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,” Audre Lorde offers the solution that the erotic can be used as power to gain a voice about sexuality that is not based on male desire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “Our acts against oppression become integral with self, motivated and empowered from within,” states Audre Lorde. For Lorde, “the erotic” is not just sexuality; it is the power for people to love and be passionate about what they do in life. She sees “the erotic” as “power” because she believes that if women have erotic “power”, they can have voice and be themselves in their lives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorde, Audre. The Uses of the Erotic. Kore Press, Jan. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] makes the society believes that lesbian's sexuality is out of the norm. While there is a general recognition that the majority of sexual acts occur without the intent of reproduction, the definition of sex is still biological in nature, meaning that sex is heterosexual sex and that entails vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Politics of Sexual Knowledge: Feminism and Sexology Textbooks|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men believe that lesbians would defeat their power so they force heterosexuality as a default sexual orientation and disdain lesbians to make coming out difficult. Lesbianism is a threat to male supremacy because it destroys the myth about female inferiority, weakness, passivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, ideas about homosexuality are rooted in problematic ideas that were set forth by men in academic power. Homosexuality in general has historically been viewed by 20th century sexologists and psychoanalysts to be a disorder that people must normalize from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexology in culture : labelling bodies and desires|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Bland, Lucy., Doan, Laura L., 1951-|isbn=9780226056678|location=Chicago|oclc=38747894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality from Sigmund Freud’s point of view was seen as a pathology in which people were affected by due to disturbances within psychosexual stages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From Freud’s theories about homosexuality, some came to the conclusion that homosexuality was something that could be treated. Additionally, Richard von Krafft-Ebing referred to lesbianism as being “incurable” although he still discussed how it could be treated.&lt;ref&gt;Maciejewski, S. P. (2016). The Relationship Between Sexology and the Lesbian Identity in Early 20th-Century Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sexual Violence
Sexual assault, rape and domestic sexual violence are serious issues in our society. Each year, for 35 of every 1,000 college women, those life-changing events will include a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Bonnie S., Francis T. Cullen, and Michael G. Turner. The Sexual Victimization of College Women. National Institute of Justice, Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people blame sexual harassment and rape on women for staying outside at night, wearing short skirts, or flirting. The society puts the fault on women’s behaviors, trying to make them feel bad. When women start thinking themselves as “trouble makers”, they remain silent. Moreover, many victims are afraid of embarrassing their families and believe that rape victims rarely get justice, instead they will be scolded. Even though all women face this oppression, women of color are more vulnerable to sexual assault than white women. The Jezebel stereotype portrays women of colors as “unrapeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sapac.umich.edu/article/57 | title=Communities of Color and the Impacts of Sexual Violence &amp;#124; Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jezebel stereotype began when 17th century European travelled to Africa and misinterpreted the nudity and polygamy of natives as uncontrollable sexual lust. This view of Black women was also perpetuated during slavery as a means to justify the sexual abuse, rape, and exploitation of these women by their slave owners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/jezebel/index.htm|title=The Jezebel Stereotype - Anti-black Imagery - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype is still widely used today in cinema, music, television and other forms of media.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Jezebel: The stereotype that deems African American women as promiscuous, seductive, hypersexual, uncaring, and willing to use sex as a way of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skepticink.com/gps/2015/04/28/mammy-jezebel-sapphire-or-queen-stereotypes-of-the-african-american-female/|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, or Queen? Stereotypes of the African-American Female • Great Plains Skeptic|date=2015-04-28|work=Great Plains Skeptic|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by this stereotype is a belief that Black women should be responsible for being sexual assaulted. Society justifies rape as a crime that only happens to women who asked for it.
Sexual violence is also a significant problem that is faced by trans and gender-nonconforming people. Trans people are often discriminated against by medical professionals, police officers, the court system, and other authoritative figures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iamoneofthem-why-we-need-to-represent-trans-people_us_58e7a32be4b0acd784ca5768|title=#IAmOneOfThem: Why We Need To Represent Trans People In Sexual Assault Advocacy|last=Clements|first=K. C.|date=2017-04-07|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, trans people are extremely vulnerable to sexual assault and often are not offered the resources to seek help, cope, and heal in a non judgmental setting. When looking at intersections of race, class, and ability, trans people are even more likely to be sexually assaulted when they face multiple levels of oppression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
;Control of Body
Women face the issue of not being able to make decisions regarding their reproductive rights or their bodies generally. Women are still fighting for access to birth control and the right of choice when it comes to abortion. Birth control and abortion have been highly politicized which has ended up politicizing women’s bodies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The politics of women's bodies : sexuality, appearance, and behavior|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Weitz, Rose, 1952-|isbn=9780195109948|location=New York|oclc=36470306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor women and women of color are likely to have even less option and access to making reproductive choices. In the Supreme Court Case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, banned public facilities and employees in Missouri from performing abortions unless it was a life saving procedure for the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Prior to this, Maher v. Roe determined that welfare payments could not be used for non therapeutic abortions even though they could be used expenses related to childbirth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These court decisions have ultimately worked in a way that do not allow poor women to choose to have an abortion.

Furthermore, women of color, especially Black, Latina, and Native American women have fallen victim to sterilization abuse. Native American women have faced being sterilized without consent or by being coerced as a result of the ideologies of imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpio|first=Myla Vicenti|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|jstor=29768273|journal=Social Justice|volume=31|issue=4 (98)|pages=40–53|doi=10.2307/29768273|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization abuse and the use birth control were seen as “a duty, not a right” for poor women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, A. (2003). Racism, birth control and reproductive rights. ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory–A Reader'', 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues within reproductive rights and control of the body are not isolated to the western world but are also global issues. Many women around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, are the victims of sex trafficking, sex slavery, child labor, genital mutilation or cutting and sterilization. Those women neither have controls of their own bodies nor freedom to speak for themselves. The documentary, based on the book, [[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]], focuses on this issues in six different countries. It talks about what sexual oppression women are facing in these places, how the government ignores and justifies the issues, and what organizations are working to fight for these victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/half-the-sky/ | title=Half the Sky &amp;#124; Independent Lens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt; the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Difei. "Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

|url=https://archive.org/details/religioussystemo03groo |pages=941–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of "vital'' qi''". Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital'' qi'' by appropriate siting of graves and structures.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"/&gt; Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/arts/200908/t20090810_1079619.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|work=stnn.cc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 房山金陵探寻_秦关汉土征未还_洪峰_博联社] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181644/http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_01/11/293453_77.shtml|title=凤凰网读书频道|work=ifeng.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html 蒋介石挖毛泽东祖坟的玄机] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620232203/http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |title=丧心病狂中国历史上六宗罕见的辱尸事 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061329/http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |archive-date=2007-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: The Art and Science of Fengshui.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=This citation does not describe the use of a Luopan.|date=November 2011}} Magnetic compasses reflect local [[geomagnetism]] which includes [[geomagnetically induced current]]s caused by [[space weather]].&lt;ref&gt;Lui, A.T.Y., Y.

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

===Traditional feng shui===
Traditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to the Feng Shui Compass: A Compendium of Classical Feng Shui|first=Stephen|last=Skinner|publisher=[[Golden Hoard]]|year=2008|isbn=9780954763992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqU2uQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UCNAAAAQBAJ|p=185|title=Feng Shui for the Curious and Serious|volume=1|first=Phil N.|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2008|isbn=9781469118826}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC|title=The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System|first=Kenneth R.|last=Lang|edition=2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781139494175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield|publisher=NASA Science|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Cody. Striking a Harmonious Chord: Foreign Missionaries and Chinese-style Buildings, 1911–1949. ''Architronic''. 5:3 (ISSN 1066-6516)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sycee-Incense.jpg|thumb|[[Sycee]]-shaped [[incense]] used in feng shui]]

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M.

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studia Geophysica Et Geodaetica, 55(1), 159–74. {{doi|10.1007/s11200-011-0009-2}}. Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9954">'''Frame analysis''' (also called '''framing analysis''') is a [[multi-disciplinary]] [[social science]] research method used to analyze how people understand situations and activities. The concept is generally attributed to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] and his 1974 book ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience'' and has been developed in [[social movement]] theory, [[policy studies]] and elsewhere.

Framing theory and frame analysis is a broad theoretical approach that has been used in [[communication studies]], news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements among other applications. "Framing is the process by which a communication source, such as a news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy" (Nelson, Oxley, &amp; Clawson, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;221).

==As rhetorical criticism==
Frame analysis had been proposed as a type of rhetorical analysis for political actors in the 1980s.  Political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published his work advancing framing analysis as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event), and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers' work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information. ..."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, '' Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action '', Lexington Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective" Kuypers details the differences between framing analysis as rhetorical criticism and as a social scientific endeavor, in particular arguing that framing criticism offers insights unavailable to social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective", P. D'Angelo and J. A. Kuypers, eds., ''Doing News Framing Analysis,'' Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 work, ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed template for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' , Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers' work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view.

==For social movements==
Framing has been utilized to explain the process of social movements (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A. and Robert D. Benford (1988). "Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization". Pp. 197-217 in Bert Klandermans, Hanspeter Kriesi, and Sidney Tarrow (eds.), From Structure to Action: Social Movement Participation Across Cultures. Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, they are part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. This is a process known as ''frame alignment''.

==Frame alignment—a process to explain social movement theory==
Snow and Benford (1988) say that frame alignment is an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, that "frame alignment" occurs (p.&amp;nbsp;198; Snow et al. 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;464&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A., R. Burke Rochford, Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert D. Benford. 1986. "Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation." American Sociological Review 51: 464-481.&lt;/ref&gt;), producing "frame resonance", which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts are successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts are:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing tasks and the degree to which these tasks are attended to will determine participant mobilization. The three tasks are: 
:# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame;
:# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem; and
:# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action.
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief system; centrality – the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness – if the frame is linked to only one core belief or value that, in itself, is of limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must be relevant to participants and inform them. Relevancy can be constrained by empirical credibility or testability, it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, that is, it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* Cycles of protest (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Framing efforts may be affected by previous frames.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once proper frames are constructed as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame alignment.

==For political thought==
Frame analysis for political thought has been dominated by two popular cognitive scientists: [[George Lakoff]], nurturant parent governance; and [[Frank Luntz]], strict father governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Watts, co-founder, Empathy Surplus Project, http://empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types of frame alignment==
There are four types, which include frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# '''Frame bridging''' is the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
#'''Frame amplification''' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# '''Frame extensions''' are a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups. (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469)
#'''Frame transformation''' is a process required when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473). When this happens, new values, new meanings and understandings are required in order to secure participants and support. Goffman (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;43–44) calls this "keying" where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework transpose in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. There are two types of frame transformation:
## '''Domain-specific transformations''' such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
## '''Global interpretive frame transformation''' where the scope of change is quite radical as in a change of world views, total conversions of thought, or uprooting of all that is familiar (e.g. moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]]; religious conversion, etc.).

'''Gottfried Semper''' ({{IPA-de|ˌɡɔtfriːt ˈzɛmpɐ|lang}}; 29 November 1803 – 15 May 1879) was a German architect, [[art critic]], and professor of architecture, who designed and built the [[Semperoper|Semper Oper]]a House in [[Dresden]] between 1838 and 1841. In 1849 he took part in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] and was put on the government's wanted list. Semper fled first to [[Zürich]] and later to London. Later he returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries.

Semper wrote extensively about the origins of architecture, especially in his book ''[[The Four Elements of Architecture]]'' from 1851, and he was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the [[Polychrome|polychrome architectural style]] of [[ancient Greece]]. Semper designed works at all scales, from major urban interventions like the re-design of the [[Ringstraße]] in [[Vienna]], to a baton for [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Schröder: "Nibelungenring und mystischer Knoten. Gottfried Sempers Entwurf zu einem Taktstock für Richard Wagner"  Jahrbuch des Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg,1993, P.120&lt;/ref&gt; His unrealised design for an opera house in [[Munich]] was adapted by Wagner for the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]].

== Life ==

=== Early life (to 1834) ===
Semper was born into a well-to-do industrialist family in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. The fifth of eight children, he attended the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums]] in [[Hamburg]] before starting his university education at [[Georg&amp;#45;August University of G&amp;#246;ttingen|Göttingen]] in 1823, where he studied [[historiography]] and [[mathematics]].  He subsequently studied architecture in 1825 at the [[University of Munich]] under [[Friedrich von Gärtner]].  In 1826, Semper travelled to Paris in order to work for the architect [[Franz Christian Gau]], and he was present when the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 broke out.  Between 1830 and 1833 he travelled to [[Italy]] and [[Greece]] in order to study the architecture and designs of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In 1832 he participated for four months in [[archaeology|archaeological]] research at the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens]].
During this period he became very interested in the [[Biedermeier]]-inspired [[polychromy]] debate, which centred on the question whether buildings in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had been colorfully painted or not. The drawn reconstructions of the painterly decorations of ancient villas he created in Athens inspired his later designs for the painted decorations in Dresden and Vienna. His 1834 publication ''Vorläufige Bemerkungen über bemalte Architectur und Plastik bei den Alten'' (''Preliminary Remarks on Polychrome Architecture and Sculpture in Antiquity''), in which he took a strong position in favor of polychromy - supported by his investigation of pigments on the Trajan's column in Rome - brought him sudden recognition in architectural and aesthetic circles across Europe [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-494114149741201/unrestricted/etd.pdf].

=== Dresden period (1834 - 1849) ===

[[File:Dresden Hoftheater J C A Richter.jpg|thumb|200px|Dresden, Interior of the first Hoftheater (Semper Oper)]]
On September 30, 1834 Semper obtained a post as Professor of Architecture at the [[Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden|Königlichen Akademie der bildenden Künste]] (today called the Hochschule) in Dresden thanks largely to the efforts and support of his former teacher Franz Christian Gau and swore an oath of allegiance to the King (formerly Elector) of Saxony, [[Anthony Clement of Saxony|Anthony Clement]]. The flourishing growth of Dresden during this period provided the young architect with considerable creative opportunities.  In 1838-40 a synagogue was built in Dresden to Semper's design, it was ever afterward called the [[Semper Synagogue]] and is noted for its  [[Moorish Revival]] interior style.&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Meek, The Synagogue, Phaidon, 1995, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The Synagogue's exterior was built in romanesque style so as not to call attention to itself. The interior design included not only the Moorish inspired wall decorations, but furnishings: specifically, a silver lamp of eternal light, which caught Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima's fancy. They gave a great deal of effort to have a copy of this lamp.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Eisler "Wagner's Three Synagogues", Artibus et Historiae 2004, Vol. 25/Nr. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eytan Pessen, Zusammenhängende Reliquien, eine Geschichte über Richard Wagner und Gottfried Semper, pp. 1-22, Semperoper Dresden, Erchien in Wagnerjahr 2013, Spielzeit 2012-2013 &amp; 2013-2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Semper's student, [[Otto Simonson]] would construct the magnificent [[Moorish Revival]] [[Leipzig synagogue]] in 1855.

[[File:Denkmal für Gottfried Semper 1887 Ki 00042-02.tif|thumb|left|150px|Monument for Gottfried Semper (1887)]]
Certain civic structures remain today, such as the Elbe-facing [[Semper Gallery|gallery]] of the [[Zwinger Palace]] complex. His first building for the Dresden Hoftheater burnt down, and the second, today called the [[Semperoper]], was built in 1841.  Other buildings also remain indelibly attached to his name, such as the Maternity Hospital, the Synagogue (destroyed during the Third Reich), the Oppenheim Palace, and the ''Villa Rosa'' built for the banker Martin Wilhelm Oppenheim.  This last construction stands as a prototype of German villa architecture.

On September 1, 1835 Semper married Bertha Thimmig. The marriage ultimately produced six children.

A convinced Republican, Semper took a leading role, along with his friend [[Richard Wagner]], in the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May 1849 uprising]] which swept over the city .  He was a member of the Civic Guard (Kommunalgarde) and helped to erect barricades in the streets.  When the rebellion collapsed, Semper was considered a leading agitator for democratic change and a ringleader against government authority and he was forced to flee the city.

He was destined never to return to the city that would, ironically, become most associated with his architectural (and political) legacy.  The Saxon government maintained a warrant for his arrest until 1863.  When the Semper-designed Hoftheater  burnt down in 1869, King [[John I of Saxony|John]], on the urging of the citizenry, commissioned Semper to build a new one.  Semper produced the plans, but left the actual construction to his son, Manfred.

"What must I have done in 48, that one persecutes me forever? One single barricade did I construct - it held, because it was practical, and as it was practical, it was beautiful", wrote Semper in dismay.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinrich Hübsch, January 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-revolutionary period (1849 - 1855) ===

After stays in [[Zwickau]], [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Strasbourg]], Semper eventually ended up back in Paris, like many other disillusioned Republicans from the 1848 Revolutions (such as [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne]]).  In the fall of 1850, he travelled to London, England.  But while he was able to pick up occasional contracts — including participation in the design of the funeral carriage for the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and the designs of the Canadian, Danish, Swedish, and Ottoman sections of the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] — he found no steady employment.  If his stay in London was disappointing professionally, however, it proved a fertile period for Semper's theoretical, creative and academic development.  He published ''Die vier Elemente der Baukunst'' (''[[The Four Elements of Architecture]]'') in 1851 and ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' (''Science, Industry and Art'') in 1852.  These works would ultimately provide the groundwork for his most widely regarded publication, ''Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik,'' which was published in two volumes in 1861 and 1863.&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Zürich period (1855 - 1871) ===

[[File:Winterthur Stadthaus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Stadthaus'' (city hall) [[Winterthur]]]]
Concurrently with the onset of the industrial revolution, the [[Swiss Federation]] planned to establish a [[Institute of technology|polytechnical]] school.  As the principal judge for the [[architectural design competition|competition]] held to select a design for the new building, Semper deemed the submitted entries unsatisfactory and, ultimately, designed the building himself.  Proudly situated (where fortified walls once stood), visible from all sides on a terrace overlooking the core of [[Zurich]], the new school became a symbol of a new epoch. The building (1853–1864), which despite frequent remodeling continues to evoke Semper's concept, was initially required to accommodate not only the new school (known today as the [[ETH Zurich]]), but the existing [[University of Zurich]], as well.

In 1855 Semper became a professor of architecture at the new school and the success of many of his students who attained success and renown served to ensure his legacy.  The Swiss architect [[Emil Schmid]] was one such student.  With his income as a professor, Semper was able to reunite his family, bringing them to Zurich from Saxony. The City Hall in [[Winterthur]] is among other buildings designed by Semper in Switzerland.

Semper provided [[Bavaria]]'s [[King Ludwig II]] with a conceptual design for a theatre dedicated to the work of [[Richard Wagner]] to be built in Munich.  The project, developed from 1864 to 1866, was never realized, although Wagner 'borrowed' many of its features for his own later theatre at [[Bayreuth]].

=== Later life (from 1871) ===
[[File:Friedhof Piramide - Grab Semper.jpg|thumb|left|Semper's grave in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]]]]
[[File:Gottfried Semper 1879.jpg|right|thumb|[[Franz von Lenbach]]'s portrait of  Gottfried Semper shortly before his death]]

Already in 1833 there were first plans in Vienna for the public presentation of the Imperial Art Collections. With the planning of the [[Vienna Ring Road]], the museum question became pressing again. Works forming the imperial art collection were scattered among several buildings. Semper was assigned to submit a proposal for locating new buildings in conjunction with redevelopment of the Ring Road. In 1869 he designed a gigantic 'Imperial Forum' which was not realized.  The National Museum of Art History and the National Museum of Natural History were erected, however, opposite the Palace according to his plan, as was the Burgtheater.  In 1871 Semper moved to Vienna to undertake the projects.
During construction, repeated disagreements with his appointed associate architect ([[Baron Karl von Hasenauer|Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer]]), led Semper to resign from the project in 1876.  In the following year his health began to deteriorate.  He died two years later while on a visit to Italy and is buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]].

The '''Great Transition''' is a term used by the Great Transition Initiative and its predecessor, the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), to describe a vision of a just and sustainable global future. The term was originally coined by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in ''The Meaning of the 20th Century – The Great Transition'' (1964) and describes the shift from [[Pre-Modern|pre-modern]] to post-modern culture, and the four possible courses of action that these organizations believe will allow humanity to successfully manage the Great Transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8YSAAAACAAJ}}|title=The Meaning of the 20th Century: The Great Transition|last=Boulding|first=Kenneth Ewart|publisher=University Press of America|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8191-7102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of the Great Transition vision include egalitarian social and ecological values, increased inter-human connectivity, improved [[quality of life]], and a healthy planet, as well as the absence of poverty, war and environmental destruction. The Great Transition concept was cited by [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]] [[Jigme Thinley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Thinly, [http://www.cabinet.gov.bt/?page_id=207 "Address by the Prime Minister on Well-Being and Happiness,"] UN Headquarters, New York, April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ryan-Collins of the [[New Economics Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ryan-Collins, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/the-great-transition ''Great Transition''] (London: New Economics Foundation, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Capital Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisymposium.com/ The Capital Institute Symposium: "Beyond Sustainability: The Road to Regenerative Capitalism] New York, June 20–21, 2013, &lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a theme for the 2011 SmartCSOs conference on strategies for Civil Society Organisations in London.&lt;ref&gt;SmartCSOs, [http://www.veblen-institute.org/Effective-change-strategies-for ''Effective Change Strategies for the Great Transition: Five Leverage Points for Civil Society Organisations''] Berlin: Smart CSOs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Great Transition was first introduced by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an international body of scientists convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] to examine the requirements for a transition to a sustainable global society. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html and Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, [http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''] (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Transition Initiative==

Further development of Great Transition scenarios is carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). Launched in 2003, GTI is a global network of several hundred scholars, intellectuals, civil society leaders, and activists working to develop visions and pathways for a “Great Transition" to a future of equity, solidarity and ecological sustainability. The Initiative was relaunched as an online journal and discussion network in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11910">In studies of the [[public understanding of science]], the '''information deficit model''' (or simply '''deficit model''') or '''science literacy/knowledge deficit model''' attributes public scepticism or hostility to science and technology to a lack of understanding, resulting from a lack of information.  It is associated with a division between experts who have the information and non-experts who do not.  The model implies that communication should focus on improving the transfer of information from experts to non-experts.

==Deficit model of science communication==

The original term ‘deficit model’ was coined in the 1980s by [[social scientists]] studying the public communication of science. The purpose of the phrase was not to introduce a new mode of science communication but rather it was to characterise a widely held belief that underlies much of what is carried out in the name of such activity. 

There are two aspects to this belief. The first is the idea that public uncertainty and scepticism towards modern science including environmental issues and technology is caused primarily by a lack of sufficient knowledge about science and the relevant subjects. The second aspect relates to the idea that by providing the adequate information to overcome this lack of knowledge, also known as a ‘knowledge deficit’, the general [[public opinion]] will change and decide that the information provided on the environment and science as a whole is reliable and accurate.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;Dickson, D. 2005. [http://www.scidev.net/global/communication/editorials/the-case-for-a-deficit-model-of-science-communic.html The Case for a ‘deficit model’ of science communication]. ''Science and Development Network''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are often heard to complain that the general public does not understand science, and that the public needs to be educated. In the deficit model scientists assume that there is a knowledge deficit that can be ‘fixed’ by giving the public more information: scientists often assume that “given the facts (whatever they are), the public will happily support new technologies.”&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, S. 2009. [http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n10/full/nnano.2009.278.html The new deficit model]. ''Nature Nanotechnology'' '''4''':609-611.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The deficit model, however, has been discredited by a wealth of literature that shows that simply giving more information to people does not necessarily change their views.&lt;ref&gt;Kearnes M., Macnaghten P. &amp; Wilsdon, J. Governing at the Nanoscale (Demos, 2006); available at &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because people want to feel that they have had their say (and have been heard) in any decision-making process, and partly because people make decisions based on a host of factors as well as the scientific ‘facts’. These factors include [[ethical]] and religious beliefs, in addition to culture, history and personal experience. This amounts to a kind of gut feeling, which scientific facts are unlikely to change. Put another way, people’s sense of risk extends beyond the purely scientific considerations of conventional risk analysis, and the deficit model marginalises these ‘[[externalities]]’. It is now widely accepted that the best alternative to deficit model thinking is to genuinely engage with the public and take these externalities into account.&lt;ref&gt;Boykoff, MT (2009), Creating a Climate for Change: Communicating Climate Change and Facilitating Social Change. Glob. Environ. Polit. 9 (2) 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit model sees the general population as the receiver of information and scientific knowledge. The information they receive, through whatever medium, has been prearranged to inform them of information that the distributors believe to be in the public’s interest. Due to the recent growth of scientific research and subsequent discoveries, the deficit model suggests that this has led to a decrease in interest surrounding certain areas of science. This can be down to the public feeling overwhelmed with information and becomes uninterested, as it appears too much to take in. 

The deficit model of scientific understanding makes assumptions about the public’s knowledge. The model perceives them to be “blank slates” where their knowledge of scientific discourse and research is almost non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Jane and Miller, Steve (2000), Science in Public: Communication, Culture and Credibility, (London: Perseus)&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this is the knowledge deficit that needs to be informed by a reliable, knowledgeable and hierarchical scientific community in the form of simple commands and generic instructions. But the increase in new information systems such as the Internet and their ease of accessibility has led to a greater knowledge of scientific research and this is evident as the public’s understanding can be seen to be growing.{{Citation needed|reason=Can this statement be validated?|date=August 2017}} This is a good thing in terms of the members of the public that can actively increase their own knowledge base, decrease the knowledge deficit and assess the truth and validity of what [[mass media]] outlets and [[governments]] are telling them. This should enhance and increase the relationship between the passive “blank slates” of the public, with the minority of the population who hold the ‘knowledge surplus’.

===Evidence for a deficit affecting opinion===
A 420 meta-analysis of 193 studies sought to interpret the link between science knowledge and attitude towards science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allum|first1=Nick|author2=Sturgis P, Tabourazi D, Brunton-Smith I|title=Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: a meta-analysis|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=2008|volume=17|pages=35–54|doi=10.1177/0963662506070159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies included were taken using nonuniform methods across the world between 1989 and 2004 to provide a cross-cultural analysis. Broad and specific science knowledge and attitude categories were correlated. General science and general biology knowledge was gauged using questions similar to those by the [[National Science Foundation]] used to capture "civil scientific literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J.D.|title=Scientific Literacy: a Conceptual and Empirical Review|journal=Dedalus|date=1983|volume=11|pages=29–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on general science and biology knowledge was then compared with attitudes towards general science, nuclear power, genetic medicine, [[genetically modified food]], and environmental science. From the raw data, it was found that a small positive correlation exists between general science knowledge and attitude towards science, indicating that increased scientific knowledge is related to a favorable attitude towards a science topic, and that this was not related to socioeconomic or technologic status of a country, but rather the number of individuals enrolled in tertiary education. However, some studies have found that high levels of science knowledge may indicate highly positive and highly negative attitudes towards specific topics such as agriculture [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=J. |title=Biotechnology in Public: a Review of Recent Research|publisher=Science Museum Publications|date=1992|location=London|pages=28–41|author2=Martin, S Tait, J.|authorlink=Attitudes of Selected Public Groups in the UK to Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus knowledge may be a predictor of the attitude strength and not necessarily if the attitude is positive or negative.

==The role of the media==

[[Mass media]] representations, ranging from news to entertainment, are critical links between the everyday realities of how people experience certain issues and the ways in which these are discussed at a distance between science, policy and public actors.&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt; Numerous studies show that the public frequently learn about science and more specifically issues such as climate change from the mass media. 

There is perceived to be a trend within much of the world’s media that a traditional commitment to report the full facts is and has given way to a more obvious, less reliable tendency to concentrate coverage on interpretations of the facts. This so-called ‘spin’ is reported by the world’s press under a combination of commercial and political pressure. This can be dangerous as it ‘fills’ the knowledge deficit and the unsuspecting public with sometimes unreliable, agenda promoting information. The subjects of anthropogenic [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] are at the forefront of this. However, in all cases it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate out the factual basis of what is being reported from the ‘spin’ that is exerted on the way a story is reported and presented.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The mass media is accessible to the vast numbers of the global population and ranging from entertainment, to news media, and spanning books, films, televisions, newspapers, radio, games and the Internet. More modern forms of communication and receiving of information have given the public a much wider and accessible format in which to gain knowledge themselves. 

The actual processes behind the communication and dissemination of information from the experts to the public may be far more complex and deep running than the deficit model suggests.

The knowledge deficit model is important for science communicators to know about. This is particularly important with respect to the concept of [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] when communicating information. Framing can be used to reduce the complexity of an issue, or to persuade audiences, and can play into the underlying religious beliefs, moral values, prior knowledge, and even trust in scientists or political individuals. Further, the transmission of scientific ideas and technological adoption may be strongly linked to the passage of information between easily influenced individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan J. |author2=Dodds, P.S.|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=2007|volume=34|pages=441–458|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the widely accepted "two-step flow" theory where a few opinion leaders acted as intermediaries between mass media and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Eliju|author2=Lazersfeld, P.F.|title=Personal Influence; the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communication|date=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the knowledge deficit is a complicated task, but if we know how the general public thinks, or how they go about learning and interpreting new information, we can better communicate our message to them in the most unbiased, objective way possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram |title=MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|location=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative models==
In contrast to the knowledge-deficit model is the [[low-information rationality]] model that states humans minimize costs associated with making decisions and forming attitudes, thereby avoiding developing in-depth understandings.

The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

'''Massurrealism''' is a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] coined in 1992 by American artist [[James Seehafer]],&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; who described a trend among some [[postmodern art]]ists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]]&amp;mdash;including [[pop art]].&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Adam. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519201344/http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact1764 "massurrealism"], Intute:arts and humanities ([[University of Oxford]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]), 17 October 2003.

==History==
[[Image:Seehafer-Untitled-1990.jpg|thumb|right|75px|SFX photography, digital collage]]
Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery.&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]], the latter consisting of [[technology]] and [[pop art]]&amp;mdash;"a form of technology art."&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;Seehafer, James. [http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm#20_06eng "Discussions: The Artist and Modern Society."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073616/http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}, lecture on Massurrealism at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Saint Petersburg Russia, 20 June 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour [[photocopy|photocopies]] and [[spray paint]]  with the artist's traditional medium of [[oil paint]].&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near [[New York City]] and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism,&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; which spread interest from artists in [[Los Angeles]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name=Itinerante&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo3VDEahCg "Conoce más sobre el MASSURREALISMO? - Mexico City"] Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Ketter&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/massurrealismus.php "Massurrealismus (Massurrealism)"], Ketterer Kunst Auction House, Munich Germany. Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehafer has said:
{{cquote|I am not being credited with inventing a new technique, nor I don't think I should be credited with starting a new art movement, but rather simply coining a word to categorize the type of modern day surrealist art that had been lacking in definition. As a result, word "massurrealism" has received a lot of enthusiasm from artists. Though there are some who feel that defining something essentially limits it, the human condition has always had the need to categorize and classify everything in life.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;}} 

The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dfine-art&amp;field-keywords=Massurrealism&amp;rh=i%3Afine-art%2Ck%3AMassurrealism/ "Other Art and related items"], Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[graffiti]] artist [[Banksy]] illicitly hung a rock in the [[British Museum]] showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which Shelley Esaak of about.com described as "a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism."&lt;ref&gt;Esaak, Shelley.

The '''Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development''' (Max-Planck-Institut für Bildungsforschung) is an internationally renowned social science research organization. Located in [[Berlin]], it was initiated in 1961 and officially began operations in 1963 under the name Institute for Educational Research in the [[Max Planck Society]], before receiving its current name in 1971. Its co-founder and first director was Hellmut Becker. The institute is part of the Human Sciences Section of the Max Planck Society.

Research activities focus on the [[Developmental psychology|development]] and [[education]] of [[humans]], with an emphasis on [[basic research]]. The concept of education is defined broadly, embracing both formal educational processes as well as developmental processes from childhood to old age. Currently, around 350 employees contribute to interdisciplinary research in four research centers and four research groups.

Research Centers
# Center for Adaptive Rationality (Director: [[Ralph Hertwig]])
# Center for Lifespan Psychology (Managing Director: [[Ulman Lindenberger]])
# Research Center History of Emotions (Director: [[Ute Frevert]])

Research Groups
# Max Planck Research Group iSearch | Information Search, Ecological and Active Learning Research with Children (Head: Azzurra Ruggeri)
# Max Planck Research Group Neural and Computational Basis of Learning, Memory and Decision Making (Head: Nicolas Schuck)
# Max Planck Research Group Naturalistic Social Cognition (Head: Annie E. Wertz)
# Heisenberg Research Group Socio-Emotional Development and Health Across the Lifespan (Head: Michaela Riediger)
# Otto Hahn Research Group on Associative Memory in Old Age (Head: Yvonne Brehmer)

In addition, there are two more research centers:

# The Harding Center for Risk Literacy was opened in April 2009. Motivating its research is the vision of enlightened individuals who are equipped to deal with risks in the modern technological world in an informed way. Director of the Harding Center is [[Gerd Gigerenzer]].
#The Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research took up its work in April 2014. It is the result of the existing collaboration between the Max Planck Society and University College London that began in 2011. The Centre is dedicated to studying the causes of psychiatric disorders as well as the causes of individual differences in cognitive development, with an emphasis on adulthood and old age. Two Co-Directors form the Leading Team of the Centre: Ray Dolan for [[University College London]] and [[Ulman Lindenberger]] for the [[Max Planck Society]].  

The Research Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (Director:[[Gerd Gigerenzer]]) ended its activities in 2017. 

The Research Center of Educational Research (Director: [[Jürgen Baumert]]) ended its activities in 2010. Its best-known projects were the TIMS study ([[TIMSS]]) and the [[PISA]] study, whose results received wide attention by both the [[mass media]] and [[politicians]].

The institute is located in [[Wilmersdorf]], a neighbourhood in the southwest of Berlin, immediately bordering on the neighborhood of [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], and is therefore considered part of Dahlem's traditional science district. This is home to a number of scientific organizations such as the [[Free University Berlin]], which works together with the institute.

The founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development was [[Hellmut Becker]], subsequently joined by [[Dietrich Goldschmidt]] (1963) and [[Saul B. Robinsohn]] (1964) as the first generation of directors. They were followed by directors [[Wolfgang Edelstein]] (1973), [[Peter M. Roeder]] (1973) and [[Friedrich Edding]] (director from 1973), [[Paul B. Baltes]] (1980), [[Karl Ulrich Mayer]] (1983), [[Jürgen Baumert]] (1996), [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] (1997), [[Ulman Lindenberger]] (2003), [[Ute Frevert]] (2008), and [[Ralph Hertwig]] (2012).

[[File:Egerton Drive - geograph.org.uk - 781883.jpg|thumb|right|A medium-density development, in the United Kingdom. Typical features are the apartments in a multi-storey (but not high-rise) building.]]

''' Medium-density housing''' is residential developments that are at higher [[Urban density|densities]] than standard low-density, (or 'broadhectare') suburban subdivisions, but not so high that they might be regarded as [[high density housing]]. In Australia the density of standard suburban residential areas has traditionally been between 8-15 dwellings per [[hectare]]. Medium density housing can range from about 25 to 80 dwellings per hectare, though most commonly the density is between 30 and 40 dwellings/hectare. Such developments may consist of [[Single-family detached home|detached]], [[Semi-detached|semi-attached]] and attached (or [[Multi-family residential|multi-unit]]) housing.

== History ==
Many traditional types of housing developed prior to car-based cities were at comparable densities, such as the [[Terraced house|terraced]] (row) or [[Courtyard house|courtyard housing]] found in many parts of the world. The inner suburbs in many Australian cities and those [[activity centre]]s developed during the late Victorian suburban boom have examples of medium density housing. Since the 1960s, many Australian states have encouraged [[urban consolidation]] policies which have facilitated the construction of medium density housing.

== Issues ==
The design of medium density housing requires careful consideration of [[urban design]] principles. In some cases, urban consolidation policies have allowed indiscriminate demolition of existing low-density housing across established residential suburbs, replacing them with various forms of medium density dwellings. Because of this, many medium density developments have been controversial in the last 20–30 years because of their perceived negative impacts on the [[neighbourhood character]] of established residential areas. Accordingly, there has been an increasing policy emphasis by state and local governments to regulate the design of new medium density developments, such as the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n government's [[ResCode]], released in 2001, and the metropolitan strategy, [[Melbourne 2030]], which seeks to confine such housing to [[activity centre]]s.

'''Mostafa Kamal Tolba''' ({{Lang-ar|مصطفى كمال طلبة}}) (8 December 1922 – 28 March 2016) was an [[Egypt]]ian scientist who served for seventeen years as the Executive Director of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Environment Encyclopedia and Directory 2001|date=2001|publisher=Europa Publications|isbn=1857430891|page=545|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in the town of [[Zifta]] (located in [[Gharbia Governorate]]), Tolba graduated from [[Cairo University]] in 1943 and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Imperial College London]] five years later. He established his own school in [[microbiology]] at Cairo University's Faculty of Science and also taught at the [[University of Baghdad]] during the 1950s. In addition to his academic career Tolba worked in the Egyptian civil service.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ozone.unep.org/Events/awards2005_profiles.shtml |title=2005 Awards Profiles: Mostafa Kamal Tolba (Egypt) |work=The Vienna Convention Award For Outstanding Contributions to the Protection of the Ozone Layer |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150412223537/http://ozone.unep.org/Events/awards2005_profiles.shtml |archivedate=2015-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving briefly as President of the [[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] (1971–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.egolympic.org.eg/ar/president_A.pdf |title=Egyptian Olympic Committee Presidents 1910 until now |publisher=[[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] |language=Arabic |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 2.86 MB |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolba led Egypt's delegation to the landmark [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|1972 Stockholm Conference]], which established the United Nations Environment Programme. Tolba became UNEP's Deputy Executive Director immediately after the conference, and two years later was promoted to Executive Director. During his long tenure (1975–1992), he played a central role in the fight against [[ozone depletion]], which culminated with the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]] (1985) and the [[Montreal Protocol]] (1987).&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mostafa Tolba: Green giant: A creator of the successful regime to reduce global emissions has died|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21695857-creator-successful-regime-reduce-global-emissions-has-died-green-giant|accessdate=2 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a significant influence in the creation and organization of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Bert|title=A History of the Science and Politics of Climate Change.

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

==Branches of natural science==
{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

'''Nizami Ganjavi''' ({{lang-fa|نظامی گنجوی|lit=Niẓāmī of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]|translit=Niẓāmī Ganjavī}}) (1141–1209), '''Nizami Ganje'i''',&lt;ref name="FrancoisePersianLiterature"/&gt; '''Nizami''',&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Haft Paykar: A Medieval Persian Romance |last=Meisami |first=Julie Scott |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8vxjAAAAMAAJ }} |accessdate= |quote=''Abû Muhammad Ilyas ibn Yusuf ibn Zaki Mu'ayyad, known by his pen-name of Nizami, was born around 1141 in Ganja, the capital of Arran in Transcaucasian Azerbaijan, where he remained until his death in about 1209. His father, who had migrated to Ganja from Qom in north central Iran, may have been a civil servant; his mother was a daughter of a Kurdish chieftain; having lost both parents early in his life, Nizami was brought up by an uncle. He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad. He lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the accounts of later biographers are colored by the many legends built up around the poet''}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Nezāmi''', whose formal name was ''Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī'',&lt;ref name="moin"&gt;Mo'in, Muhammad(2006), "Tahlil-i Haft Paykar-i Nezami", Tehran.: p. 2: Some commentators have mentioned his name as “Ilyas the son of Yusuf the son of Zakki the son of Mua’yyad” while others have mentioned that Mu’ayyad is a title for Zakki.  Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare. So it is possible that Muayyad was a sobriquet for Zaki or part of his name (like Muayyad al-Din Zaki).

Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provided no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140–46) and that his background was urban.

The verse (quoted on p. 14): "I am lost as a pearl in the sea of Ganja, yet I am from the Qohestan of the city of Qom ", does not expressly mean that he was born in Qom. On the other hand, Nizami's mother was of Kurdish origin, and this might point to Ganja where the Kurdish dynasty of Shaddad ruled down to AH. 468; even now Kurds are found to the south of Ganja."

And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.

Moscow: Academkniga, 2003 ISBN 5-94628-118-6. excerpt:: "К этому времени отмеченные иранский и армянский факторы способствовали быстрой азербайджанизации исторических героев и исторических политических образований на территории Азербайджана. В частности, в 1938 г. Низами в связи с его 800-летним юбилеем был объявлен гениальным азербайджанским поэтом (История, 1939. С. 88–91). На самом деле он был персидским поэтом, что и неудивительно, так как городское население в те годы было представлено персами (Дьяконов, 1995. С. 731). В свое время это признавалось всеми энциклопедическими словарями, выходившими в России, и лишь Большая Советская Энциклопедия впервые в 1939 г. объявила Низами "великим азербайджанским поэтом" (Ср. Брокгауз и Ефрон, 1897. С. 58; Гранат, 1917. С. 195; БСЭ, 1939. С. 94). Translation from Russian: "By that time, already mentioned Iranian and Armenian factors contributed to the rapid azerbaijanization of historical heroes and historical political entities on the territory of Azerbaijan. In particular, in 1938, Nizami in connection with his 800-year anniversary was declared a genius(marvelous) Azerbaijani poet (History, 1939. pp. 88–91). In fact, he was a Persian poet, which is not surprising, because the urban population in those years was Persian (Dyakonov, 1995. page. 731). At one time it was recognized by all Encyclopedic Dictionaries of published in Russia, and only the Big Soviet Encyclopedia for the first time in 1939, announced Nizami as a "Great Azerbaijani poet" (Sr. Brockhaus and Efron, 1897. page. 58; Garnet, 1917. page. 195 ; BSE, 1939. p. 94)".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpt: "Indeed, the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers, which in many ways inaugurated high Stalinism as a cultural paradigm, was a curiously solemn parade of old-fashioned romantic nationalisms. Pushkin, Tolstoy and other officially restored Russian icons were not the only national giants of international stature – all Soviet peoples possessed, or would shortly acquire, their own classics, their own founding fathers and their own folkloric riches. The Ukrainian delegate said that Taras Shevchenko was a "genius"and a "colossus" "whose role in the creation of the Ukrainian literary language was no less important than Pushkin's role in the creation of the Russian literary language, and perhaps even greater."The Armenian delegate pointed out that his nation's culture was "one of the most ancient cultures of the orient,"that the Armenian national alphabet predated Christianity and that the Armenian national epic was "one of the best examples of world epic literature"because of "the lifelike realism of its imagery, its elegance, the profundity and simplicity of its popular wisdom and the democratic nature of its plot."The Azerbaijani delegate insisted that the Persian poet Nizami was actually a classic of Azerbaijani literature because he was a "Turk from Giandzha" and ..."

Excerpt: "The attempt to 'annex' an important part of Persian literature and to transform it into 'Azerbaidzhani literature' can be best exemplified by the way in which the memory of the great Persian poet Nizami (1141—1203) is exploited in the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a ‘poet of the Soviet Union’, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic. The Soviet regime proclaims its ownership over Nizami also by ‘interpreting’ his works in accordance with the general pattern of Soviet ideology. Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's ‘great merit’ consisted in having undermined Islam by ‘opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world’.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter. In a talk with the Ukrainian writer, Mikola Bazhan, Stalin referred to Nizami as ‘the great poet of our brotherly Azerbaidzhani people’who must not be surrendered to Iranian literature, despite having written most of his poems in Persian."

===Family===
Nezami was married three times.  His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's "most beloved" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and "apple of my eyes". In "Haft Peykar" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.

Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that ''Afaq'' was the real name of his wife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location= Yerevan |year=2012 |pages= 173–175 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |title=ON THE MODERN POLITICIZATION OF THE PERSIAN POET NEZAMI GANJAVI: Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh: Free Download &amp; Streaming: Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have taken the ''Afaq'' in that verse to simply mean "horizon" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, "God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!".&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Bashiri,[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Teahouse/Figures.html#Nizami "The Teahouse at a Glance" – Nizami's Life and Works], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Nezami was not a philosopher&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Mehdi Amin Razavi, "The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia", RoutledgeCurzon; annotated edition (July 4, 1996).  pp. 178–187&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of [[Avicenna]] or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi.  However, he is regarded as a philosopher&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; and gnostic&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as [[Qutb al-Din Shirazi]].&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;

Often referred to by the honorific Hakim ("the Sage"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style.  About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so.  His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[astrology]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[alchemy]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], Koranic exegesis, [[Islamic]] theory and [[law]], [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] myths and legends,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sutenly, "Visionary Rose: Metaphorical Application of Horticultural Practice in Persian Culture" in Michel Conan and W. John Kress, "Botanical progress, horticultural information and cultural changes", Dumbarton Oaks, 2007.  p. 12: "In a highly evocative tale he relates in the Makhzan al-Asrar ("Treasury of Secrets"), the twelfth-century Persian poet, Nizami whose oeuvre is an acknowledged repository of Iranian myths and legends, illustrates the way in which the rose was perceived in the Medieval Persian imagination"&lt;/ref&gt; history, [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[thought|esoteric thought]], music, and the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;  His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"&gt;Peter J. Chelkowski, "Mirror of the Invisible World", New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1975.
p. 1: "The culture of Nizami's Persia is renowned for its deep-rooted tradition and splendor. In pre-Islamic times, it had developed extraordinarily rich and exact means of expression in music, architecture, and daily life as well as in writing, although Iran, its center—or, as the poets believed, its heart—was continually overrun by invading armies and immigrants, this tradition was able to absorb, transform, and ultimately ocercome foreign intrusion. Alexander the Great was only one of many conquerors, to be seduced by the Persian way of life."
p. 2:"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived."
p. 6: "Nizami's strong character, his social sensibility, and his poetic genius fused with his rich Persian cultural heritage to create a new standard of literary achievement.  Using themes from the oral tradition and written historical records, his poems unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran", p. 9:"Probably no Persian writer has inspired succeeding generation of poets more than Nizami", p. 6: ""Khosrow and Shirin" proved to be a literary turning point not only for Nizami but for all of [[Persian poetry]].  Furthermore it was the first poem in Persian literature to achieve complete structural and artistic unity".  p. 2;"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived." p. 1: "By the end of the tenth century, Persian literature was world renowned; it was heralded from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus" pp2:"Few facts about the life of Nizami are certain.  Because he was not a court poet and it was his poetry rather than his life or his political connections that won him enduring fame, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties...".  p. 9: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled"&lt;/ref&gt; cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement.  Being a product of the Iranian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; and the whole ancient world.

The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]'' contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Šarvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Unlike other parts of Persia,  where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; [[Khaqani]]'s mother was a [[Nestorian Christian]], Mojir Baylqani's mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], and Nezami's mother was a [[Kurd]].&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;

By the end of the 10th century,&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt; Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus.  The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of [[Qatran Tabrizi]](1009–1072) who served in the courts of the [[Shaddadid]] and [[Rawadid]] dynasties.  Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the "Azerbaijan"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; or "Trans-Cacausian" school&lt;ref&gt;Rypka, Jan. "Poets and Prose Writers of the Late Saljuq and Mongol Periods", The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5, The Saljuq and Mongol Periods, ed., Published January 1968. Excerpt: "The school, which begins with Qatran (d. 1072), formed a well defined group of teachers and pupils of whom two, Khaqani and Nezami, were to exert a lasting development of their respective genre: Khaqani being the greatest exponent of the qasida and Nezami the most brilliant writer of romantic epics".&lt;/ref&gt; or "Tabriz School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"&gt;P. Chelkowski, "Literature in Pre-Safavid Isfahan", International Society for Iranian Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1/2. — Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. on behalf of International Society for Iranian Studies, 1974. — p. 112-131.) Quote: "The three main literary styles which follow each other consecutively are known as: Khurasani, Iraqi, and Hindi. The time spans of each style are equally flexible. Within these broad geographical divisions we then come across certain "literary schools" which reflect regional peculiarities and idiosyncrasies and are identified with smaller entities like provinces or towns. For example, there are: the Azerbayjani school, The Tabriz school, or the Shirvan school."&lt;/ref&gt; or "Shirvan School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"/&gt; or "Arranian Style"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/NozhatAl-majales|title=Nozhat al-Majales|first=|last=Author passed away 700 years ago|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tarnama.org/library/Nozhat.al-Majales.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of Persian poetry.  This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with "Khurasani" ("Eastern") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of [[technical terminology]] and [[Christian]] imagery, the presence of Persian&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Meneghini, “Saljuqs: Saljuqid Literature” in Encyclopedia Iranica. Excerpt:"The Saljuqs never governed the vast conquered territories as a centralized empire. The main power centers were Hamadān and Isfahan in the west, and Marv and Nišāpur (Nishapur) in the east, but their courts changed location several times over the decades. There were also branches of the Saljuq dynasty in Kermān, Syria, and in Anatolia, and the dynasty’s strong tendency towards decentralization led in the 12th century to the establishment of the atābak, or ‘parallel’ dynasties of Turkish slaves, put in government in some areas (Marāḡa, Tabriz, Shiraz, etc.) ‘external’ to the main centers of power. This phenomenon favored the development of a vigorous cultural life in cities such as Ray, Shiraz, and Yazd and especially in the urban centers of Azerbaijan and Arrān such as Tabriz and Šervān.” “With their capital, Šarvān (Šervān), in the lands of the eastern Caucasus, the Šarvānšāh dynasty also always maintained its independence from the Great Saljqus” “The geographical closeness of the territories subject to the Ildeguzids and those under the Šarvānšāh encouraged the flow of intellectuals and poets from one court to the other. It is also possible to speak of a certain similarity of inspiration and of style between the poets born and educated in these areas, to the point of defining them as belonging to the ‘Azerbaijan school’ (Rypka, Hist. Iran Lit., pp. 201–9). The complexity of the language and of the compositional techniques, the originality and multiplicity of the themes, the presence of Persian archaisms and, at the same time, a wide range of borrowings from Arabic vocabulary are among the stylistic features which are common to poets in this cultural context compared with other contemporaries closer to the Khorasani style.”&lt;/ref&gt; archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term "'Iraqi" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.&lt;ref&gt;De Bruijn, J.T.P. (1997), “Iran: Literature”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. IV:52–75.  excerpt: "“On the other hand he enriched the romantic mathnawi by using imagery of lyric poetry to the full, treating it with all the rhetorical ingenuity characteristic of the 'Iraqi style”"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Qizil Arslan Welcomes the Poet Nizami.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|[[Eldiguzids|Atabeg of Azerbaijan]] [[Qizil Arslan]] welcomes Nizami]]
The [[Seljuqs]] took control of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] from the [[Shaddadid]]s in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts.  In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture, art and poetry in their courts.  Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil cervants, merchants were in great demand and rival dynastines continue to vie for the service of Persian poets.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties including the [[Seljuqs]], [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|Eldiguzids]](who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), [[Shirvanshah]]s, the ruler of Ahar and [[Ahmadilis]].  Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the court life and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life.  Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties which list the names of events of the ruling families.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

According to Professor Chelkowski: ''It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)''.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"&gt;(Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:" in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma, 1977).
p. 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career.  In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."
p. 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators".
p. 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians".
p. 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well".
p. 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.
p. 22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)".
p. 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince – not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: ''who has decorated words like new bride''.  Nezami advises the son of the [[Shirvanshah]] to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed Gohrab. "Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing", Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has used the [[Shahnameh]] as a source in his three epics of "Haft Paykar", "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" and "Eskandar-nameh".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;

The story of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' also had an immense influence on Nezami.  Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from [[Ferdowsi]], but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=VIS O RĀMIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially noticeable in the Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.

The first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s "Hadikat al-Hakika".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Its great impact on Persian literature is evidenced by the numerous citations from the poem occurring in mystical as well as profane works. It has been taken as a model by several other poets, including Neẓāmi, ʿAṭṭār, Rumi, Awḥadi, and Jāmi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"&gt;Chelkowski, P.J (1995), “Nizami Gandjawi”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. 8: 76–81.

Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers.

===Persian lyrical poetry===
Only a small corpus of his lyric poetry, mainly qaṣīdahs ("odes") and [[ghazals]] ("lyrics") have survived.  Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology [[Nozhat al-Majales]] (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani&lt;ref name="Nozhat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nozhat-al-majales |title=NOZHAT AL-MAJĀLES – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with 23 other poets from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]].  A famous [[ghazal]] of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:

{{cquote|
I went to the Tavern last night, but I was not admitted&lt;br /&gt;
I was bellowing yet nobody was listening to me&lt;br /&gt;
Either none of the wine-sellers were awake&lt;br /&gt;
Or I was a nobody, and no one opened the door for a Nobody&lt;br /&gt;
When more or less half of the night had passed&lt;br /&gt;
A shrewd, perfect man (rind) raised his head from a booth and showed his face&lt;br /&gt;
I asked him: “to open the door”, he told me: “go away, do not talk nonsense!&lt;br /&gt;
At this hour, nobody opens door for anybody&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a mosque where its doors are open any moment&lt;br /&gt;
Where you can come late and move quickly to the first row&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Tavern of Magians and rinds dwell here&lt;br /&gt;
There are Beauties, candle, wine, sugar, reed flute and songs&lt;br /&gt;
Whatever wonders that exists, is present here&lt;br /&gt;
(in this tavern there are) Muslims, Armenians, Zoroastrian, Nestorians, and Jews&lt;br /&gt;
If you are seeking company of all that is found here&lt;br /&gt;
You must become a dust upon the feet of everyone in order to reach your (spiritual perfection) goal”&lt;br /&gt;
O Nezami! if you knock the ring on this door day and night&lt;br /&gt;
You won't find except smoke from this burning fire&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location=Yerevan |year=2012 |page= 191 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quinary ("Panj Ganj" or "Khamsa")===
Nezami is best known for his five long narrative poems, which have been preserved.  He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life.  Nezami was a master of the ''[[Masnavi]]'' style (double-rhymed verses).  He wrote poetical works; the main one is the ''Panj Ganj'' (Persian: Five Treasures), also known by the Persian pronunciation of the Arabic word ''Khamsa'' ("Quintet" or "Quinary").  The first of his five 'Treasures', called ''The Storehouse of Mysteries'',&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"&gt;CHARLES-HENRI DE FOUCHÉCOUR, "IRAN:Classical Persian Literature" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by [[Sanai]] of Ghazna's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth.  The other ‘Treasures’ were medieval romances. Khusaw and Shirin, Bahrām-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Book of Kings,&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Leyli and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The ''Khamsa'' was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts in later centuries.  Examples include the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]], created for the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in the 1590s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The ''Quinary'' (Five Treasures-Panj Ganj) includes the five Persian books of Nezami:

====Makhzan al-Asrar====
*'''Makhzan al-Asrar''' (Persian: مخزن الاسرار) "The Treasury of Mysteries" (1163) (some date it 1176)
The ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian [[distich]]s was dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan.  The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics.  Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name.&lt;ref name="JTP"&gt;JTP de Bruijn. Persian Sufi Poetry, An Introduction to the Mystical – Taylor and Francis (Routledge) 1997 pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical [[Homiletics]] style.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In a few chapters he address the duties of a King, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; rather than his royal patrons.  In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  There is no indication that these were [[Sufi]] vigils, but are used as a literally fantasy on the duty of spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry which had started with [[Sanai]] and was continued by others, in the first place by [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]].&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;

Not a romantic epic, "The Treasury of Mysteries" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Darab, Gholam Hossein. Treasury of Mysteries, translation of Makhzanol Asrar. (London:. Arthur Probsthain, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;  After this early work, Nezami turned into narrative poetry.

====Khosrow o Shirin====

*'''Khosrow o Shirin'''(Persian: خسرو و شیرین) "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" (1177–1180)
A story of pre-Islamic&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; Persian origin which is found in the great epico-historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin |title=ḴOSROW O ŠIRIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story  chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother [[Qizil Arslan]].  It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II Parviz]] towards his Armenian&lt;ref name="eskandar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami |title=ESKANDAR-NĀMA OF NEŻĀMĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; princess [[Shirin]].  "Khusrow and Shirin" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) |title=FARHĀD (1) – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; They are eventually married, but eventually Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who finally falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The influence of [[Vis o Ramin]] is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Rāmin, as well as being in the same meter ([[hazaj meter|''hazaj'']]) as Gorgāni's poem.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Rāmin.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"/&gt;  With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

====Layli o Majnun====
*'''Layli o Majnun'''(Persian: لیلی و مجنون) "[[Layla and Majnun]]" (1192)

A story of Arabic origin&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=LEYLI O MAJNUN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;  The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's "Seven Beauties"(Haft Paykar).  The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public.  The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet "the possessed" (Majnun).&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts.  However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep.  His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband.  Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact.  Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union.  However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert.  Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress.  Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies.  They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage.  Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan.  Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: "wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them".&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"&gt;[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A.

Brill Online. Excerpts: "The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in ʿAyyūḳī's Warḳa u Gulshāh.  Niẓāmī states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Niẓāmī added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjnūn and Laylī united in paradise at the end of the romance."&lt;/ref&gt;

He Persianises&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, "Layli and Majnun: Madness and Mystic Longing" Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun. 2003, pp. 76–77, excerpt: Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami's time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami's romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‘Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"/&gt;

====Eskandar Nameh====
*'''Eskandar-nameh''' (Persian: اسکندرنامه) "The Book of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]" (1194) or (1196–1202)

The [[Alexander Romance|Romance of Alexander the Great]]" contains 10,500 distichs.  There are differences of opinion on whether this was Nezami's last epic or the Haft Paykar.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The names of its dedicatees are uncertain but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from [[Qur'an]]ic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;

The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages.   The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslamEskandar"&gt;
Abel, A. (1978), “Eskandar nāma”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. 4:127–129.  Online: Abel, A.; Ed(s). "Iskandar Nama." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill onlien edition). Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian "knight", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Niẓami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.&lt;/ref&gt; knight.

An English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by [[Henry Wilberforce-Clarke]] was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D176%26work%3D002 |title=Persian Literature in Translation The Packard Humanities Institute: Eskandar-Nama (The Book of Alexander) |publisher=Persian.packhum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haft Paykar====
{{main|The Seven Beauties (poem)}}
*'''Haft Paykar''' (Persian: هفت پیکر) "[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|The Seven Beauties]]" (1197) (also called Bahram-Nama)
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a "Haft Paikar" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Paikar]] of Nizami. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
A pre-Islamic story of Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of [[Bahram Gur|Bahram V]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king, who is born to [[Yazdegerd I|Yazdegerd]] after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to [[Ahura Mazda]] for a child.  The Haft Paykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler [[Bahram Gur]].&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  His adventurous life had already been treated by [[Ferdowsi]] in the [[Shahnama]], to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar |title=HAFT PEYKAR – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of [[Bahram Gur]] and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq.  Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to Nom'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Paykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt; for the pleasure of God.  Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears.  As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (''gūr'') he instead finds his tomb (''gūr'').&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;

Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: "the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time . . . one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature".&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The Haft Paykar is considered the poet's masterpiece.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  Overall, in this masterpiece, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;

The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;The Haft paikar [Engl.], Wilson, Charles Edward, London: Probsthain. 1924. (Probsthain's Oriental series.). {{ISBN|0-85382-017-1}} (see [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0853820171 Amazon])&lt;/ref&gt;  A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Professor Julia Scott Meysami.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

Take not apart the good pearl from the string; from him who is of evil nature flee.
An evil nature acts consistently: have you not heard that ''Nature does not err''?
The evil-natured man keeps faith with none; the erring nature does not fail to err.
The scorpion since it is by nature bad—to let it live's a fault, to kill it, good.
Seek knowledge, for through knowledge you effect that doors to you be opened and not closed.
He who shames not at learning can draw forth pearls from the water, rubies from the rock.
Whilst he to whom no knowledge is assigned—that person (you will find) ashamed to learn.
How many, keen of mind, in effort slack, sell pottery from lack of pearls (to sell)!
How many a dullard, through his being taught, becomes the chief judge of the Seven Climes!}}

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:Nizami Gəncəvinin məqbərəsi.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Mausoleum]] in [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

===Persian culture===
The influence of Neẓāmi's work on the subsequent development of Persian&lt;ref name="Parraello"&gt;Domenico Parrello, "ḴAMSA OF NEẒĀMI" in Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;
literature has been enormous and the Khamsa became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures).&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;  The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages.

In Persian miniature, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works.&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Nezami is admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader''.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;  Nezami composed his verses in [[Persian language|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Russian philologist Ivan Mikhailovich Steblin-Kamensky, Professor and the Dean of the Oriental Department of Saint Petersburg University comments("Oriental Department is ready to cooperate with the West", Saint Petersburg University newspaper,  № 24—25 (3648—49), 1 November 2003").  http://www.spbumag.nw.ru/2003/24/1.shtml – Accessed February 2008.  Низами писал свои стихи и поэмы на персидском языке.  Nizami wrote his poems in Persian language.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western Encyclopedias such as [[Encyclopedia of Islam]],&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt; [[Encyclopædia Iranica]],&lt;ref name="iranicaonline1913"/&gt; [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; and orientalists of many countries&lt;ref&gt;AO Tamazishvili.

Moscow: Eastern. lit., 2004. From the History of Study of Nezami-ye Ganjavi in the USSR: around the anniversary – E. Bertels, Stalin, and others. Pp. 173–199. (in Russian)  excerpt: "Главным, революционным для отечественной науки результатом этой кампании стало отнесение Низами к поэтам азербайджанским, а его творчества к достижениям азербайджанской литературы, в то время как в мировом востоковедении (а ранее и в советском) доминировал взгляд на него как представителя литературы персидской. Точки зрения, что Низами персидский поэт, и сегодня придерживаются ученые многих стран, в первую очередь — Ирана.".  "...while in the realm of the world Oriental Studies (and prior to this in the Soviet as well), the viewpoint of him as a representative of Persian literature.  The viewpoint that Nezami is a Persian poet is even today held by the scholars of many countries, specially of Iran."&lt;/ref&gt; consider Nezami as a significant [[Persian people|Persian]] poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lalita Sinha (Universiti Sains Malaysia, Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature and Comparative Religion). Garden of Love. World Wisdom, Inc, 2008. {{ISBN|1-933316-63-2}}. page: 24. "Hailed by scholars of Persian literature as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature (Levy 1969, XI), Nizami is also referred...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the Five Treasures of Nezami as their model may be mentioned [[Amir Khusro]], Jalal Farahani, [[Khwaju Kermani]], Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman [[Jami]], Hatefi Jami, [[Vahshi Bafqi]], Maktabi Shirazi, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], [[Abdul-Qader Bedil|Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi]], [[Fuzûlî]], Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-ye-jamali |title=ḴAMSA-ye JAMĀLI – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahmad Khani]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Not only poets, but historians such as Rawandi were also influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poem in rendering history.  Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.

According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: ''Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones.  The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions'' of Layli and Majnun.&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt;

According to Vahid Dastgerdi, ''If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun''.

[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that:  ''Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge''.

[[Jami]] in his Baharestan mentions that: ''Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description''.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: ''The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses'' and ''To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time''.

[[Amir Khusro]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,&lt;br&gt;
Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.&lt;br&gt;
In it – pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,&lt;br&gt;
Yet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting."

===Western reception===
[[File:Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature, Baku, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
''A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love.  Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.''

With regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential.  Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

Nezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]".  Recorded with [[Derek and the Dominos]], "Layla" was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.  The album was highly influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love.  The fifth song of ''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'', "I Am Yours", was in fact a Nezami composition, set to music by Clapton.

In 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized in the [[University of Cambridge]].  The book containing the proceedings of this conference was published under the title: "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim " in 2011 by Leiden Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Johan Christoph |last1=Burgel |first2=Christine |last2=van Ruyuymbeke |title=Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim |publisher= Amsterdam University Press |year=2011 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z5YccgAACAAJ }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PC power management''' refers to the mechanism for controlling the power use of [[personal computer hardware]].  This is typically through the use of software that puts the hardware into the lowest power demand state available.  It is an aspect of [[Green computing]].

A typical office PC might use on the order of 90 watts when active (approximately 50 watts for the base unit, and 40 watts for a typical LCD screen); and three to four watts when ‘asleep’. Up to 10% of a modern office’s electricity demand might be due to PCs and monitors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sleepless of Seattle; Why Windows Power Management Doesn't Always Work, Mark Blackburn, Strategy Analyst, 1E, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some PCs allow low power settings, there are many situations, especially in a networked environment, where processes running on the computer will prevent the low power settings from taking effect.  This can have a dramatic effect on energy use that is invisible to the user. The monitor may have gone into standby mode, and the PC may appear to be idle, but operational testing has shown that on any given day an average of over 50% of an organisation's computers would fail to go to sleep, and over time this happened to over 90% of the machines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Windows 'Insomnia' (Sleepless PCs) ==
The Windows power management system is based upon an idle timer. If the computer is idle for longer than the preset timeout then the PC may be configured to sleep or hibernate. The user may configure the timeout using the Control Panel. Windows uses a combination of user activity and CPU activity to determine when the computer is idle.

Applications can temporarily inhibit this timer by using the ''SetThreadExecutionState'' API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373208(VS.85).aspx |title= SetThreadExecutionState Function |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate reasons why this may be necessary such as burning a DVD or playing a video. However, in many cases applications can unnecessarily prevent power management from working. This is commonly known as Windows 'Insomnia' and can be a significant barrier to successfully implementing power management.

Common causes of 'insomnia' include:

* Legacy or non-power management aware applications
* Open file handles on remote computers
* Faulty mice which can cause pointer drift. This makes the operating system believe that a user is present
* Scheduled maintenance tasks causing significant CPU activity
* High network activity

== Software solutions ==
Operating systems have built-in settings to control power use.  [[Microsoft Windows]] supports predefined power plans and custom [[Sleep mode|sleep]] and [[hibernation (computing)|hibernation]] settings through a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] Power Options applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-create-delete-power-plan-scheme#1TC=windows-7 |title= Windows 10 help|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[OS X]] includes idle and sleep configuration settings through the Energy Saver [[System Preferences]] applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201714 | title= Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac|publisher=Apple|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Linux distribution]]s include a variety of power management settings and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management | title= Power management|publisher=ArchLinux|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant market in third-party [[Comparison of power management software suites|PC power management software]] offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide.aspx|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author=The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products are targeted at enterprise environments offering [[Active Directory]] integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting.

[[File:ELISA.jpg|thumb|ELISA: a common immunoassay]]
'''Palaeoimmunology''' or '''paleo-immunology''' ("''paleo''"=ancient, "''immuno''"=referring to [[immunology]]) is the analysis using [[Immunohistochemistry|histochemical]] techniques to look at the [[matrix protein]]s in historic and [[pre-historic]] materials.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Modern [[Immunoassay|immunological assays]] are used to detect the presence of specific [[antigen]]s in the sample material. Specimens subject to immunoassays have usually been preserved in a way that has prevented biomolecular targets from degrading. This has either been achieved through natural preservative circumstances, such as accelerated [[fossil]]ization,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweitzer|first=M.

== Examples of use ==
Paleo-immunology encompasses a variety of immunoassays performed on a diverse array of archaeological materials. Paleo-immunology is a new, growing field that is still being properly defined. Examples of paleo-immunology as they appear in peer reviewed literature are as follows:
* The extraction and analysis of [[Collagen|collagen peptides]] from fossilized bones.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* The use of [[immunofluorescence]] and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] techniques in order to study the proteins of the [[extracellular matrix]] found in mummified tissues. This was done to further understand the physiologic and pathologic alterations that can occur in preserved prehistoric tissues.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
* A plague dipstick assay was used to detect the presence of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] antigens in medieval French graves. This paleo-immunological assay is also known as a "rapid diagnostic test for the plague" (RDT).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kacki|first=Sacha|last2=Rahalison|first2=Lila|last3=Rajerison|first3=Minoarisoa|last4=Ferroglio|first4=Ezio|last5=Bianucci|first5=Raffaella|year=2011|title=Black Death in the rural cemetery of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse Aude-Languedoc, southern France, 14th century: immunological evidence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310003675|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=3|pages=581–587|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">The '''Plebs' League''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] educational and political organisation which originated around a [[Marxist]] way of thinking in 1908 and was active until 1926.

Central to the formation of the League was [[Noah Ablett]], a [[miner]] from the [[Rhondda]] who was at the core of a group at [[Ruskin College, Oxford]] who challenged the lecturers' opposition to Marxism.  In the 1907–8 academic year, Ablett began leading unofficial classes in Marxist [[political economy]] which were attended by [[Ebby Edwards]], among others.  Ablett returned to South Wales in 1908, where he began promoting Marxist education through local branches of the [[Independent Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/History/Nextstep.html Syndicalism in South Wales], Bob Pitt&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of students and former students at Ruskin founded the Plebs' League in November 1908, also launching the ''Plebs' Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Proletcult'', Eden Paul (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first issue of the ''Plebs'', dated February 1909, Ablett contributed an article on the need for independent [[working class education]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders'', A. T. Lane (1995), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The League ran classes teaching Marxist principles and later [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008), p. 687 {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1909, student agitation for Marxism continued at Ruskin.  The students were supported by the Principal, [[Dennis Hird]], and when he was dismissed the students went on strike, refusing to attend classes.  The rebels formed the [[Central Labour College]], which worked closely with the Plebs' League.&lt;ref name="welsh" /&gt;

By 1910, the Plebs' League was active in South Wales, Lancashire and Scotland.  Activists included [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[William Mainwaring]], [[Mark Starr (labor educationalist)|Mark Starr]] and [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]].&lt;ref name="pitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1986/12/ruskin.htm The Ruskin Debate: Their college or ours?], ''Socialist Worker Review 93'', [[Duncan Hallas]] (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The League had sympathies with [[De Leonism]], primarily represented in Britain by the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]].  It later had a relationship with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley (2000), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was absorbed by the [[National Council of Labour Colleges]] the year after the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]], although the ''Plebs' Magazine'' continued to appear for many years.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

Polyculturalism is an ideological approach to the consequences of intercultural engagements within a geographical area which emphasises similarities between, and the enduring interconnectedness of, groups which self-identify as distinct, thus blurring the boundaries which may be perceived by members of those groups.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal&amp;Levy2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2010.01022.x|title=The Colorblind, Multicultural, and Polycultural Ideological Approaches to Improving Intergroup Attitudes and Relations|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|volume=4|pages=215–246|year=2010|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Lisa|last2=Levy|first2=Sheri R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[multiculturalism]] which instead emphasises the separateness of the identities of self-identifying cultural groups with an aim of preserving and celebrating their differences in spite of interactions between them. Supporters of polyculturalism oppose multiculturalism, arguing that the latter's emphasis on difference and separateness is divisive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hikevipadan.blogspot.com//%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Polyculturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2017/06/07/if-multiculturalism-isnt-working-why-not-embrace-polyculturalism%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Latest News &amp; Opinion on Culture &amp; Social Affairs - SBS Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmful to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podur|first1=Justin|last2=Albert|first2=Michael|date=15 July 2003|title=Revolutionizing Culture Part One|url=https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|journal=Podur ZMag|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611094904/https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|archive-date=11 Jun 2008|access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of polyculturalism was first proposed by [[Robin Kelley]] and [[Vijay Prashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876|title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism|first=Nick|last=Haslam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to Other Areas of Thought==
Research has shown that belief in polyculturalism is linked to cultural intelligence (CQ) in [[Australia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="BP2017"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2017.08.006|title=Belief in polyculturalism and cultural intelligence: Individual- and country-level differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=119|pages=307–310|year=2017|last1=Bernardo|first1=Allan B.I|last2=Presbitero|first2=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that polyculturists are less likely to demonstrate [[sexism|sexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="RLM2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684313510152 |pmid=25530662 |pmc=4266561 |title=Polyculturalism and Sexist Attitudes |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=519–534 |year=2014 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R |last3=Militano |first3=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that polyculturalism has a positive relationship with cross-cultural attitudes in both the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.12.005 |title=Polyculturalism and attitudes towards people from other countries |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=335–344 |year=2013 |last1=Bernardo |first1=Allan B.I |last2=Rosenthal |first2=Lisa |last3=Levy |first3=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Comparison of Cultural Ideologies==

{{refimprove-section|date=August 2018}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}

Like advocates of [[multiculturalism]], proponents of polyculturalism encourage individuals to learn about different cultures, especially those they may come into contact with in their own areas.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt; However whereas multiculturalism advocates for toleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823095427/http://www.semcoop.com/detail/0807050105%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Wayback Machine|date=23 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between members of distictly different cultures groups, polyculturalism is less rigid and acknowledges that individual shape their own identities and may choose to change&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003" /&gt; so as to express their culture in a different way to their own ancestors, either by adding elements of other cultures to it or by eliminating aspects of it.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt;

Polyculturalism rejects the concept of race as a [[social construct]] with no scientific basis,&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korber |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Polyculturalism |url=http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |journal=One World One People |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014230838/http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |archive-date=14 Oct 2008 |access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it recognises the concept of ethnicity&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=Andrea |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Vijay Prashad: Polyculturalism and Kung Fu |url=http://writingcities.com/2016/09/27/vijay-prashad-polyculturalism-kung-fu/ |dead-url= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, considering ethno-nationalism a barrier which must be transcended in the pursuit of a dynamic community culture.

Critics of [[multiculturalism]] argue that it entrenches [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026490 |pmid=22250894 |title=The relation between polyculturalism and intergroup attitudes among racially and ethnically diverse adults |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2012 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt; while polyculturalism aims to forge a common new identity&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"/&gt;

Polyculturalism acknowledges that cultures are dynamic, interactive and impure while [[multiculturalism]] treats them as static, isolated and complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism |url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en |date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Problem property''' is [[terminology]] used by [[city government]]s seeking to apply pressure to the owners and managers of buildings where [[crime]] has occurred. "Problem property" is also used to describe any land or building that has negative issues associated with it, such as difficult to sell, uncertain ownership, flooding, etc.

In the rental-property industry, the theory is that [[landlord]]s have a duty to ensure [[leasehold estate|tenants]] will not engage in criminal behavior that affects the quality of life of neighbors.  And that the failure of some landlords to screen applicants appropriately for their units can lead to greater criminality and lower quality of life in some [[neighborhood]]s.

Critics claim that it is in the political interest of local-government officials and [[police]] to shift the blame for crime from the criminals and the responsibility for fighting crime themselves to nearby property owners.  This is a common strategy in [[community policing]].

'''Ralava Beboarimisa''' (born 1978) is a [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] politician who is Minister of transport and meteorology of Madagascar and is best known for being Ministry of Environment, Ecology, Sea and Forest from January 2015 to April 2016.

One of the biggest problems Beboarimisa faced during his tenure as minister of the environment was the rapid deforestation and threat to the flora and fauna of the island that Madagascar is undergoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralava Beboarimisa, le nouveau ministre de l'environnement a du pain sur la planche (Ralava Beboarimisa, the new Minister of the Environment has a lot to do)|url=https://www.madonline.com/ralava-beboarimisa-le-nouveau-ministre-de-lenvironnement-a-du-pain-sur-la-planche/|publisher=MadOnline|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first law he helped pass was the so-called "Beboarimisa law" which toughened the sanctions of cutting down redwoods in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralava Beboarimisa : La nouvelle loi mettra fin aux trafics illicites et conduira au développement (Ralava Beboarimisa, the new Minister of the Environment has a lot to do)|url=http://www.midi-madagasikara.mg/economie/2016/01/25/ralava-beboarimisa-la-nouvelle-loi-mettra-fin-aux-trafics-illicites-et-conduira-au-developpement/|publisher=Midi-Madagasikara|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=28 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beboarimisa's hard tactics at combating deforestation made him a popular figure in the country, and for a brief period of time it was rumored that he might succeed [[Jean Ravelonarivo]] as the next prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primature Ralava Beboarimisa poussé dans la course (Primature Ralava Beboarimisa pushed into the race)|url=http://www.laverite.mg/politique/item/142-primature-ralava-beboarimisa-poussé-dans-la-course.html|publisher=La Vérité|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Beboarimisa ended up losing his job in April 2016 after more than 1,000 tons of redwood were discovered in possession of a Hong Kong businessman in Singapore, leading to questions how such a large amount could have been smuggled out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar - Singapore rosewood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13021">'''Random International''' is a London-based art collective and collaborative studio, founded in 2005. The group shot to prominence with its interactive ''[[Rain Room]]'' art installation. Random International creates art installations that investigate notions of human consciousness, perception and instinct. Its work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Barbican"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its exhibition pieces have now become permanent installations, the first of which was the critically acclaimed and popular ''Rain Room'', now permanently housed in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].

The group was founded in 2005 by German artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass. Ortkrass graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]] in London in 2005, while Koch graduated in 2004. Its relentless experimentation with digital technologies and reflections of the human form has led it to collaborate with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] roboticists on creating 'point studies' that reduce representation of the human form in motion into 15 light points,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ew/articles/show/43500-random-international-art-technologys-magical-realists|title=Random International: Art &amp; Technology's Magical Realists {{!}} ArtSlant|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with architects to create large scale public displays that include covering a German train station with LED lights.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Rain Room ==
''Rain Room'', now installed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, was the first installation of a Random International project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London (2012);&lt;ref name="Barbican2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], Los Angeles (2015–2017). ''Rain Room'' allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet.&lt;ref name="Barbican3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/leisure/rain-room-brings-fun-intrigue-to-sharjah-1.2215470|title=Rain Room brings fun, intrigue to Sharjah|last=Reporter|first=Faisal Masudi, Staff|date=2018-05-02|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming "performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharjahart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been a celebrated [[Instagram]] theme:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the photo and video sharing platform has been cited as a major source of Random International's popular recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, billionaire [[Budi Tek]], Yuz Museum's founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced he would build a 150 square metre ''Rain Room'' in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xy4gjj/rain-room-in-the-rain-forest-billionaire-plans-bali-art-theme-park|title=Rain Room in the Rain Forest: Billionaire Plans Bali Art Theme Park|date=2015-03-13|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was shelved due to Tek's ill-health.

A number of Chinese companies have copied the ''Rain Room'' concept and, in 2016, the Chinese Jiajiale Dream Park opened its $15 million ''Rain Room'' clone called the ''Magic Rain Zone''. One company offers as many as 12 clones of the installation. Koch estimated that as many as 8-10 companies had produced ''Rain Room'' clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5xyb/rent-your-own-rain-rooms-become-big-business-in-china|title=Rent-Your-Own Rain Rooms Become Big Business in China|date=2017-05-16|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instant Structure for Schacht XII ==
The group's first outdoor installation was ''Tower: Instant Structure for Schacht XII,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-build-towering-shower-at-ruhrtriennale/|title=random international builds towering shower at ruhrtriennale|date=2013-09-03|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; created  for [[Urbane Künste Ruhr]] for the [[Ruhrtriennale]] 2013. The work cycled 30,000 litres of water per minute from the former coal mines of [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex|Zollverin]], a World Heritage site, to create an instantaneous towering structure of water. The mines pump millions of water out each year to maintain the surrounding area's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgpqpn/random-international-tower-instant-structure-for-schacht-XII|title=Random International Turn 30,000 Liters Of Water Into A Monumental Tower|date=2013-09-05|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self &amp; Other ==
The first permanent installation in the UK for Random International, ''Self &amp; Other,'' is located on the [[South Bank]] arts and cultural area of the [[Albert Embankment]]. It was launched in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/random-international-sculpture-art-270618|title=Random International is unveiling their first UK permanent kinetic sculpture|date=2018-06-27|work=It&amp;#8217;s Nice That|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swarm Studies ==
A series of works based on LED walls that mimic the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and insects,  Random International's ''Swarm Studies'' have been created ranging from a small version, ''Swarm Study / XI,'' at the Park Hyatt New York’s restaurant Bevy, to the huge ''Swarm Study / IX'', which spans the entire façade of the train station in [[Chemnitz]], Germany—the group's largest installation at the time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these studies, 2010's ''Swarm Light'' is in the collection of the Maxine &amp; Stuart Frankel Foundation For Art in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/swarm-light|title=SWARM LIGHT {{!}} Random International {{!}} Archello|website=Archello|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], ''Swarm Study / III''  consists of four cubic forms suspended from the ceiling, each made of a grid of illuminated brass rods. A camera tracks visitors, making the lights of the installation flicker, brighten, and dim in response to their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-swarm-studyiii-at-the-va/|title=random international: swarm study/iii at the V&amp;A|date=2011-07-02|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Everything &amp; Nothing ==
The group's first [[solo exhibition]] in Asia, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'', was on display at Shanghai's Yuz Museum from 20 April – 2 September 2018. The exhibition takes its title from the video installation, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' (2016), which attempts to question humankind’s place in a technological dynamic by showing a steamroller crushing everything in its path.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/rain-room-sharjah-uae-1275371|title=Random International’s Rain Room Gets Its First Permanent Home—in the Desert {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-30|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is the collective's first work to be created from video alone, a loop of over 6 hours. The piece was originally commissioned for the ''Wonder Materials'' exhibition at the [[Science and Industry Museum|Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was displayed in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.random-international.com/everything-and-nothing-2016/|title=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|website=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Everything &amp; Nothing'' "documents the simultaneous decay and progress of the industrialised world in an age of relentless transformation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/random-international-everything-nothing/|title=Random International: Everything &amp; Nothing - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's newest work at the time of the exhibition was also displayed, ''Turnstiles'' (2018), an analogue piece which consists of a maze of barriers. ''Self &amp; Other'', another exhibit, consists of a reflective wall of mirrors, light and glass which reflect the visitor taking a selfie.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/event/Art-Art_Exhibitions/53866/Everything--Nothing.html|title=Everything &amp; Nothing|last=|first=|date=24 November 2018|website=Time Out Shanghai|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also saw ''Rain Room'' return to the museum in a revised and larger format, 1,600 square feet (larger, in fact, than the Sharjah installation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' Shanghai reviewed the exhibition saying, "''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is a meditative video installation about how fucked we are in this age of un-tempered technological advancement. 'Turnstiles' tracks the same story, but instead with a matrix of spinny turnstiles that you can navigate while doing your best to avoid serious injury to the groin area."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Previous works ==
The group has previously held solo exhibitions at Lunds Konsthall, Sweden (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Paris (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-self-portrait-temporary-printing-machine/|title=random international's self portrait temporary printing machine|date=2012-09-27|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pace Gallery]], New York (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4qan9/random-international-exhibition-rain-room|title=The 'Rain Room' Creators Are Getting Their Own Exhibition|date=2016-08-24|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work is held in the collections of MoMA, [[Sharjah Art Foundation]], Yuz Museum, LACMA and London's V&amp;A, where its ''Swarm Study / III'' is on long-term display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, its work ''Zoological'' debuted at London’s [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] as part of Wayne McGregor’s ''+/- Human''. The group's work has also formed part of the Lichtsicht Biennale (2015), Ruhrtriennale (2013), and [[Moscow Biennale|Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Ar]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (2011).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Schmidt Ocean Institute''' is a non-profit [[private foundation]] focused on [[oceanography]], founded in March 2009 by [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Wendy Schmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2010_audited_financial_statement.pdf | publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAG"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/life-after-google-eric-schmidts-60-million-ocean-adventure-2011-2?op=1 |title = LIFE AFTER GOOGLE: Eric Schmidt's $60 Million Ocean Adventure, |author = TheoDP |date = 15 Feb 2011 |work = Businessinsider.com. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute’s goal is to advance ocean exploration, discovery, and knowledge using technological advances, data-rich observation and analysis, and open sharing of information.

The Schmidt Ocean Institute, which was previously known as the Schmidt Research Vessel Institute, has been awarded grants from the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]] for the purpose of owning and operating scientific [[research vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation 2009 IRS Form 990-PF |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2009_TSF_Foundation_990_PF.pdf  |publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research vessels==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has operated two research vessels, RV ''Lone Ranger'' and RV ''Falkor''.

''Lone Ranger'', a 255-foot former ocean tug, was donated to the Institute by [[Peter B. Lewis]] in 2009 and was operated by the Institute in various Atlantic Ocean research cruises.&lt;ref name="LAG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute website |title = Sargasso Sea research expedition equipment |url = http://www.mbari.org/expeditions/Sargasso/equip.htm |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lone Ranger'' was decommissioned from the Schmidt Ocean Institute scientific fleet in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Previous Ship, Lone Ranger |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/65 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lone Ranger's'' successor is RV ''Falkor'', a 272-foot former German fisheries protection vessel purchased from the German government in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Field Trials 2012 |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/713 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2012, ''Falkor'' underwent an extensive refit at the Peters Schiffbau shipyard in Germany to convert it into a globally capable oceanographic research vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Specifications |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/47 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Refit |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/80 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Germany: Peters Schiffbau Shipyard Completes RV FALKOR's Refit Project |url = http://shipbuildingtribune.com/2012/04/23/germany-peters-schiffbau-shipyard-completes-rv-falkors-refit-project/ |date = 23 April 2012 |work = Shipbuildingtribune.com |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refit cost $60 million, and in addition to its own equipment, ''Falkor'' will at times also carry equipment from other oceanographic organizations, such as the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]’s [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus underwater vehicle]], for exploring the [[Mariana Trench]].&lt;ref name="Witze"&gt;{{cite news |title = Private research ship makes waves |url=http://www.nature.com/news/private-research-ship-makes-waves-1.12680 |author = Alexandra Witze |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research proposals for time aboard ''Falkor'' are peer reviewed by independent scientists. Program managers favor [[open data]] projects, but data sharing is not a requirement. If a project is accepted, the ship time is free to the researchers, but they must find additional funding for their salaries and post-cruise science.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat"&gt;{{cite news |title = Push the boat out |url=http://www.nature.com/news/push-the-boat-out-1.12669 |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Falkor'' is intended to be a long-term global resource, integrating the latest technology into ocean exploration. Schmidt Ocean Institute program managers have encouraged scientists from around the world to apply for ship time; although the first cruises scheduled will be led by US and Canadian researchers, researchers from 23 countries applied in the most recent round of research proposals.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat" /&gt;

==Activities and expeditions==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has undertaken multiple research projects in collaboration with organizations including the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]], the [[Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping|Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center]], [[IFREMER]], the Center for Environmental Visualization, the Marine Science and Technology Foundation, and various universities and oceanographic research institutions.

Schmidt Ocean Institute researchers and research vessels have studied remote [[coral reef]] conditions at the [[Kiritimati|Kiritimati atoll]], [[deep-water coral]] habitats using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]], Atlantic marine pollutants and [[biofuel]] candidates in the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] and [[Sargasso Sea]], and the long-term effects of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Projects |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/science |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Expeditions |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/expeditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a team aboard RV ''Falkor'' started conducting a multibeam mapping survey of the Campeche Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico, which may provide insight into geological records for the [[Chicxulub crater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Imaging the K-T Boundary |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/1453 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During field trials in July 2012 of the multibeam [[echo sounding]] equipment on RV ''Falkor'', the team aboard discovered the wreck of lost polar expedition ship ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'' off the southern coast of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Scott's wrecked ship Terra Nova found off Greenland |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19288188 |author = Paul Rincon |date = 16 August 2012 |work = BBC News. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selfism''' refers to any philosophy, theory,  doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly [[selfish]] principles as being desirable. It is usually used [[pejoratively]].

==Definition==
The term "selfism" was used by [[Paul Vitz]] in his 1977 book ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship''. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold [[God]]-centered [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and claims that all of modern-day [[liberalism]] and [[leftism]] are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of [[Erik Erikson]], [[Erich Fromm]], and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of [[David Seabury]], [[Ayn Rand]], and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Later popularizers of similar positions include [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Paul Lepanto]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Harry Browne]], and [[David Kelley]], among others. None of these named the system they espoused "selfism" or characterized it as "selfist", although both Seabury and Rand included the word "selfishness" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Secularism|secularists]] ("[[Atheism|atheist]] capitalists"), but Seabury was a [[Christian]], while Erickson and Fromm were prominent [[Leftism|leftists]].

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and author of [[The Satanic Bible]], acknowledges [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] as a source of inspiration for [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. This form of Satanism holds the [[self]] above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins of selfist thought==
Some early examples of "selfist" thinking are the [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] philosophies of [[Yangism]] in [[ancient China]] and of [[Cyrenaic]] [[hedonism]] in [[ancient Greece]].  Yangists followed the teachings of [[Yang Zhu]] and might have been influenced by [[Taoism]].  [[Cyrenaics]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], were [[Religious skepticism|skeptics]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] (but perhaps nominally Greek [[Paganism|pagans]]). [[Thomas Hobbes]], who could also be viewed as ''selfist'', was a [[Materialism|materialist]] but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and [[state church]]. [[Joseph Butler]], whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|orthodox Christian]] and was canonized an [[Anglican]] [[saint]]. The views of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Max Stirner]] provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

'''Single Best Answer''' ('''SBA''' or '''One Best Answer''') is a written examination form of [[multiple choice]] questions used extensively in [[medical education]].

== Structure ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SBA example.jpg|thumbnail|SBA example from Medical Schools Council, UK]] --&gt;

A single question is posed with typically five alternate answers, from which the candidate must choose the best answer. This method avoids the problems of past examinations of a similar form described as Single Correct Answer. The older form can produce confusion where more than one of the possible answers has some validity. The newer form makes it explicit that more than one answer may have elements that are correct, but that one answer will be superior.

Prior to the widespread introduction of SBAs into medical education, the typical form of examination was true-false [[multiple choice]] questions. But during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], educators found that SBAs would be superior.&lt;ref name="pmid18585017"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18585017 | doi=10.1016/j.clon.2008.05.010 | volume=20 | title=The introduction of single best answer questions as a test of knowledge in the final examination for the fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists in Clinical Oncology | year=2008 | journal=Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) | pages=571–6 | last1 = Tan | first1 = LT | last2 = McAleer | first2 = JJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R. (July 2004) [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/22554 "Social Savings as a Measure of the Contribution of a New Technology to Economic Growth".] Working Paper 06/04, Department of Economic History, [[London School of Economics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in 1950 by [[United States|American]] economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]], explains the [[methodology]] works to estimate the cost-savings of the new [[technology]] compared with the next best alternative.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The first oral presentation was at the 1960 Purdue Cliometrics meeting, and the first published version was in the Journal of economic history in 1962.

A recent [[Survey data collection|survey]] can be found in "economic and history: surveys in Cliometrics", edited by David Greasley and Les Oxley and published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2011. The relevant chapter is entitled "social savings" and is by [[Tim Leunig]], [[London School of Economics]]. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00636.x/abstract]

==Calculation==
The amount of social savings (SS) may be calculated as
:SS = (P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;)T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; is the price per unit of the alternative technology, P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; is the price of the technology being evaluated. T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the quantity processed by the technology being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; This saving in resource costs may be taken to be equal to the gain in [[Gross National Income|real national income]].&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; Two noted social savings applications include social savings analysis on the contribution of the [[Rail transport in the United States|railway]] to the 19th century economic growth and the impact of [[information technology]] to the 20th century economic growth.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt;

== Railroads and American economic growth ==
Social savings was introduced and applied to the railroads in a seminal book by economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]].&lt;ref name="Fogel64"&gt;Fogel R. (1964) ''Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History'', The Johns Hopkins University Press; 1st Edition. {{ISBN|0-8018-0201-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The social savings analysis involved using quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 if there were no railroads.&lt;ref name="davis.shtml"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History | Book Reviews | EH.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of railroads, freight transportation by rivers and canals would have been only moderately more expensive along most common routes.  &lt;ref name="davis.shtml"/&gt; Fogel concluded that the difference in cost (or "social savings") attributable to railroads was negligible - about 2.7% of GNP. This [[counterfactual history]] view was vastly different from views proffered by railroad [[historians]] and made a controversial name for [[cliometrics]].

During [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]], splash conception occurs when [[semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|sperm]] migrates from the [[anus]], across the [[perineum]], to the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], and subsequently into the [[vagina]], causing the fertilization of an [[ovum]] followed by [[Conception (biology)|conception]] or [[pregnancy]].  This migration does not occur by virtue of the spermatozoa's tail propulsion, but rather due to gravity or other kinetic forces (such as that of a penis pulling out of an anus and dragging semen left on the tip, or being expelled from the anus due to said penis's recent ejaculation, across the perineum and onto the labia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked. [[WASH]] experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="IPSnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/10/opinion-sanitation-water-hygiene-for-all-cannot-wait-for-2030/|title=Opinion: “Sanitation, Water &amp; Hygiene For All” Cannot Wait for 2030|last1=Rao Gupta|first1=Geeta|date=October 2015|website=Inter Press|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/beyond-the-sdgs-how-to-deliver-water-and-sanitation-to-everyone-everywhere-86975|title=Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere|last1=Batty|first1=Margaret|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, accomplishing the other SDGs will require assuring clean water and sanitation for all as stated in SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=SuSanA|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1027">'''Technical informatics''' is a subclass of [[computer engineering]] that combines general [[informatics]] with technology. Particularly in the field of [[electrical engineering]], it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of technical informatics is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/faculties/overview/f10/courses/u/01602.php Technical Informatics (diploma) description]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15576">'''''The Meaning of the City''''' is a theological essay by [[Jacques Ellul]] which recounts the story of the [[city]] in the [[Bible]] and seeks to explain the city's biblical significance.

Ellul wrote the book in 1951; it was published in English translation in 1970, and then in French in 1975 as ''Sans feu ni lieu : Signification biblique de la Grande Ville''.

== Synopsis ==
Where is the city's foundation? All [[mythology|mythologies]] speak of an [[Garden of Eden|original garden]], returning to which is man's only desire. The city is the world of man: his creation (made in his image) and his pride because it reflects his culture and his civilization. It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man's power over Nature and man, a place of [[slavery]] par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the [[History of the city|city's origins]]. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man's return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the [[New Jerusalem]]. "This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts."&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Rognon, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-une-pensee-en-dialogue/oclc/180983332&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Jacques Ellul : Une pensée en dialogue''], éd. Labor et Fides, 2007, p.86 [http://www.jacques-ellul.org/influences/la-bible]. "Cela signifie que, par amour, Dieu révise ses propres desseins, pour tenir compte de l'histoire des hommes, y compris de leurs plus folles révoltes."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the [[fall of man]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do.

== Exegesis ==
Ellul gives an [[exegesis]] of the city in the Bible. This is not a formalist or structuralist exegesis, but a traditional exegesis, which is to say it seeks to present the text as it appears today and in its entirety. This means that the author, here, seeks within the Bible all passages which relate to the city, as the basis for a biblical definition of this place. If the author "hears" the more sophisticated meanings given by his contemporaries, he nevertheless considers that one "cannot honestly interpret a text outside its content and the meaning which it gives itself". He therefore refuses to divide the text into independent fragments, instead taking them in their entirely; he considers the text to be essentially [[dialectical]], implying that its meaning arises within an ensemble of contradictory statements. So doing, Ellul does not seek to explain why the Bible says what it says on the subject of cities, but to show what it says.

== Critique of the city ==
It is within the framework of his critique of technique (see ''[[The Technological Society]]'') that Ellul approaches the city. In effect, according to him, the city is the place where technique becomes [[system]], preventing man from living in freedom. And according to Ellul, this freedom arises in work within proximity to God, and later in the perfect example of [[Jesus Christ]]. Thus, "if one follows Ellul, humanity's freedom of choice seems singularly limited: return to the path of the Christian God or accept the dissolution of humanity. Strictly speaking this conception of liberty is a negation of autonomy, is a [[heteronomy]]. Facing this dilemma to which Ellul condemns us, how can we raise a challenge, how can we find a truly autonomous liberty, which is to say find its true characteristics and true limits?".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Jézéquel, ''Jacques Ellul ou l’impasse de la technique'', Revue du Mauss, 2010. "si l’on suit Ellul, la liberté de choix de l’humanité semble singulièrement restreinte : retrouver le chemin du Dieu chrétien ou se résigner à la disparition de l’humanité. Stricto sensu cette conception de la liberté est une négation de l’autonomie, c’est une hétéronomie. Face au dilemme auquel nous condamne Ellul, comment relever le défi, comment retrouver une liberté véritablement autonome, c’est-à-dire trouvant en elle-même ses propres déterminations et ses propres limites ?"&lt;/ref&gt; This remark, published in the ''[[Revue du MAUSS]]'', critiques Ellul's theistic thrust, but also shows the extent to which man wants to live without God, considering that true liberty cannot exist in relation to a creator.

The city is precisely the place created by man. It is the affirmation of man taking his life into his own hands, independently of God; it is the expression of man's rebellion against God. God has placed man at the garden, a place adapted to him. But man refuses the life for which God has destined him, which is unsettled, and men have gathered and organized themselves in order to depend no longer on nature. This political project (see Ellul 1965, ''L'Illusion politique''), the management of the metropolis, underlies the city: security, survival, commerce, collective living... But this city, created to strengthen human solidarity and protect man against natural aggressions, becomes the place to isolation and insecurity. "Divine or celestial, the city reflects with the space of European culture a religious ideal of 'collective life', on which converge all the major issues of future society. The eater of men and the producer of social regulations, of power conflicts and [[culture shock]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.10). "Divine ou céleste, la cité renvoie dans l’espace culturel européen à l’image d’un idéal religieux du « vivre ensemble » où convergent tous les enjeux majeurs de la société future. Mangeuse d’hommes et productrice de nouvelles économies, la ville s’apparente à un espace où s’opèrent toutes sortes de mobilités démographiques, de régulations sociales, de conflits de pouvoir et de chocs culturels"&lt;/ref&gt; The history of cities is the history of religions cross and interlocking, and of the Christian experience of this relationship, principally in relation to the urban conquest through which religion expanded itself. Since the 1960s, thinkers have raised the question of the "Secular City",&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cite-seculiere-essai-theologique-sur-la-secularisation-et-lurbanisation/oclc/77172490&amp;referer=brief_results ''La Cité séculière. Essai théologique sur la sécularisation et l’urbanisation''], Paris, Casterman, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Comblin, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/theologie-de-la-ville/oclc/299893060&amp;referer=brief_results ''Théologie de la ville''], Paris, Éditions Universitaires, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''], Paris, Gallimard, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and the city has become a "theological issue".&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the urban project, which diverts man from God, will at the last be judged severely.

The city is also the location of spiritual conflict. It therefore bears a profound meaning, a spiritual mark, which is the sign of malediction, and the founder of the city is cursed among all. "It is through slavery that Israel is linked to the city." All the cities, within the Bible, are cursed, and "never a word of hope, never a word of pardon for the city, for it is a terrible manifestation of the brilliant morning star, which has debased humanity." This malediction explains all the difficulties, all the problems encountered in cities, and however much one may seek solutions (security, urbanism, isolation), man will never make the city anything but that which it is. Here, one can detect the influence of Ellul's good friend [[Bernard Charbonneau]]. "Ellul was constantly recognizing his debt to Charbonneau", said pastor and theologian Jean-Sébastien Ingrand, director of the Strausbourg Protestant Media Library. Together they published "Outline of a personalist manifesto", in which they denounced, among other things, the city as contrary to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul et Bernard Charbonneau, ''Directives pour un manifeste personnaliste'', 1935, texte dactylographié édité par les groupes d'Esprit de la région du Sud-ouest; publié en 2003 par [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cahiers-jacques-ellul-no-1-les-annees-personnalistes-pour-une-critique-de-la-societe-technicienne/oclc/52772778&amp;referer=brief_results les Cahiers Jacques-Ellul n°1, "''Les années personnalistes''"], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "The man of the city is rich in money but poor in space and time", they wrote. "The city is a place of inhumanity, especially the ''[[banlieue]]'', a banal and homogeneous space, the exact opposite of the country. The city is a place of artifice, where nature is vanquished. But note: one must not romanticize nature, which is perfectly capable of defending itself alone. It is man who is fragile, and above all his liberty. Bernard Charbonneau with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jardin-de-babylone/oclc/2547227&amp;referer=brief_results ''Le jardin de Babylone''] (1969) and Jacques Ellul with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''] (1975), rediscovered this point.&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"&gt;Roger Cans, ''compte-rendu d’un colloque sur Bernard Charbonneau, précurseur de l’écologie'', organisé du 2 au 4 mai 2011 à l’IRSAM (université de Pau). "L’homme des villes est riche d’argent, mais pauvre d’espace et de temps », écrivent-ils. « La ville est un lieu d’inhumanité, la banlieue surtout, espace banalisé et uniforme, l’exact opposé de la campagne. La ville est un lieu d’artifice, où la nature est vaincue. Mais attention : il ne faut pas idéologiser la nature, qui se défend très bien toute seule. C’est l’homme qui est fragile, et surtout sa liberté. Bernard Charbonneau avec ''Le jardin de Babylone'' (1969) et Jacques Ellul avec Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu'' (1975), se retrouvent sur ce point"&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has grown to the size foretold by Ellul and Charbonneau, who were witnessing the urbanization of the world, the universalization of technique, and the standardization of all civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Porquet]], « Nous tous pareils » in [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-lhomme-qui-avait-presque-tout-prevu/oclc/401756457&amp;referer=brief_results ''Jacques Ellul - L'homme qui avait (presque) tout prévu''], Le Cherche-Midi, 2003, p. 151-158&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 2008, the world's urban population surpassed its rural population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronoo.com/fr/articles/population-mondiale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Where Charbonneau applied the symbol of [[Babylon]], Ellul focuses on [[Ninevah]]. The big city is a mass which cannot survive without sacrificing liberty. "This, then, is what separates the two men: against the catastrophism of Charbonneau, Ellul presents a Christian hope, which leads from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem foretold in Revelations.".&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"/&gt;

Trophic species have identical prey and a shared set of predators in the food web. This means that members of a trophic species share many of the same kinds of ecological functions.&lt;ref name="Dunne02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt; The idea of trophic species was first devised by [[Joel E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
