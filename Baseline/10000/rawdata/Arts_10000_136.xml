[[File:AC Dom Rathaus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Aachen Town Hall seen from the cathedral]]
'''Aachen Town Hall''' (German: ''Rathaus'') is located opposite to the [[Aachen Cathedral]] and is one of the most striking structures in the ''[[Altstadt]]'' of [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]. It is built in the [[Gothic architecture]].  

==History==
[[File:Aachen Rathaus 1520.jpg|thumb|Drawing by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1520]]
[[File:De merian Westphaliae 100.jpg|thumb|Engraving by [[Matthäus Merian]] in 1647]]
In the first half of the 14th century, Aachen’s citizenry built the [[seat of local government|city hall]] under the leadership of its acting mayor Gerhard Chorus (1285–1367) as a sign of their civic freedom. Yet, they had to promise to establish a space in the new town hall that could host the traditional [[coronation feast]] that was part of the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation ceremony]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Up to then, the nearby mid-13th century Grashaus – which is one of the city’s oldest still-standing buildings – had served the community in that function. Construction began in 1330 on top of the foundation walls of the ''[[Aula Regia]]'', part of the derelict [[Palace of Aachen]], built during the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Dating from the time of [[Charlemagne]], the Granus Tower and [[masonry]] from that era were incorporated into the south side of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Niehüsener: ''Bericht des Arbeitskreises für den Wiederaufbau der Rathaustürme.'' Aachen 1977&lt;ǃ--[p. ???]--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was completed in 1349, and while the town hall served as the administrative center of the city, part of the city’s munitions and weaponry was housed in the Granus Tower, which also served as a prison for some time.

===Three Kings relief===
[[File:DreikönigenreliefACR.jpg|thumb|left|Torsos of the ''Three Kings relief'', from the 14th century]]
From 1380, the entrance of the ''Kaisertreppe'' ("Emperor's stairs"), which connected the subterranean levels to the Coronation Hall, was adorned by the [[limestone]] relief of the [[biblical magi|Three Kings]] and a depiction of the [[Adoration of the Magi]]. Four limestone blocks formed the relief, with one serving for each king, and the last depicting [[Madonna (art)|Mary and Jesus]].

In 1798, during the [[French period]], the relief was partially destroyed, and the remaining pieces were left as they were above the entrance to the main guard station.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ernst Günther Grimme: ''Das Rathaus zu Aachen.'' Aachen 1996, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval artwork was then replaced by Gottfried Götting with a replica in 1879. Before [[World War II]], it was transferred to the local museum (''Heimatmuseum'') in Aachen and disappeared in the war.

===Baroque===
[[File:Aachen Marktplatz 1840.jpg|thumb|The baroque city hall and the Aachen market, [[steal engraving]] by [[Henry Winkles]] around 1840]]
During the great Fire of Aachen in 1656, portions of the roof and towers burned. The destroyed elements were then replaced in a [[baroque]] style. From 1727 until 1732 the Chief Architect of Aachen, [[Johann Joseph Couven]], led a fundamental baroque remodeling of the structure, especially of the front façade and entry steps. The [[gothic art|gothic figures]] and [[muntin]] adorning the windows were removed, and even the interior was remodeled in the baroque style. Today, the sitting room and the “White Hall” both still convey this change in style.

Characteristic of the time period, the wood paneling of the White Hall is in the style of Aachen-[[Liège]] baroque master Jacques de Reux, while the wall painting comes from master painter Johann Chrysant Bollenrath. This hall was originally for a panel of jurists who controlled the quality of cloth produced in Aachen, but the space would later serve as the main office for the mayor of Aachen.

At the treaty signing ceremony that ended the [[War of Austrian Succession]] in 1748, the “Peace Hall” was set up but was not used because of a dispute between the envoys. As a compensation for this, the city obtained portraits of the envoys, which can now be found hanging in the various spaces of the City Hall.

===19th century===
Since the end of the [[Imperial City of Aachen|Imperial City]] era and the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation of the area, the structural condition of the City Hall was greatly neglected, so that the building was seen to be falling apart by 1840. After that, and especially under the watchful eye of 19th century Chief Architect Friedrich Joseph Ark, the building was rebuilt little by little in a [[Gothic Revival Architecture|neogothic]] style that tried to capture its original gothic elements. The side of the City Hall that faced the Market was adorned with statues of 50 kings, as well as symbols of art, science, and Christianity.

In the meantime, the Coronation Hall was restored and a new entrance was constructed. In addition, the painter [[Alfred Rethel]] had the task to embellish the room with a large series of frescoes. Begun in 1847 and completed by his student in 1861, the frescoes eventually depicted legends from the life of Charlemagne. After the destruction of similar artwork at the [[Neues Museum]] in [[Berlin]], this painting is one of the most important testimonies to the [[Romanticism|late romantic style]] in Germany.

===City hall fire, 1883===
[[File:Aachen Marktplatz 1900.jpg|thumb|Seventeen years after the fire of 1883]]
Starting from a fire in the Johann Peter Joseph Monheim Drug and Material Warehouse at 26 Antonius Street (''Antoniusstraße''), flames first spread when cinder from the roof landed on the Granus Tower and set it ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/content/titleinfo/1499528 |title=Das Rathaus zu Aachen und sein Brand am Petri- und Pauli-Tage 1883: mit 5 Abb / von Johannes Chorus Aachen: Peter Kaatzer, 1883 |publisher=Digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within four hours the roof and both towers of the City Hall were aflame, as were a large number of surrounding houses on the south side of the Market. Within City Hall, the Coronation Hall with its frescoes by [[Alfred Rethel]], as well as the building's first floor, was spared. In the time immediately following the fire, its roof and towers were kept erect through makeshift structures of support.

On 1 November 1884 the city of Aachen initiated a contest among German architects to see who would rebuild City Hall. Of the 13 submitted designs, the first prize went to Aachen architect Georg Frentzen, who in 1891 was commissioned to rebuild the building and its towers. The restoration of the inner rooms was performed under the leadership of Joseph Laurent, and around 1895 sculptures depicting the ''Knight Gerhard Chorus'' and ''Johann von Punt'' (who was leader of the city six times from 1372 to 1385) were reinstalled in the bay windows on the back side of City Hall, and the eight shields depicting the coat of arms of medieval nobility (Margarten, Berensberg, Roide, Hasselholz, Surse, Wilde, Joh Chorus, and Zevel) were remade in the [[spandrel]]s. This was done by Karl Krauß.

The restoration was finally finished in 1902, and the unveiling of the Rathaus took place with the blessing of [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Emperor of Germany, on 19 June 1902.

===20th century===
[[File:Aachen Rathaus Separatistenunruhen.jpg|thumb|Devastation of the interior of the city hall after its storming by separatists on 21 October 1923]]
Aachen’s city hall survived [[World War I]] without sustaining damage, but during civil unrest that arose in the course of a [[secession|separatists’ movement]] whose goal was the creation of an independent [[Rhenish Republic]], City Hall was stormed by a group of separatists who caused serious damage both to its interior and exterior. Parts of the façade, such as adorning statues and both clocks, were broken, as were all window panes on the first floor on the Market side. Additionally, several rooms inside the building were ransacked, and many of the famed frescoes within were heavily damaged by gunfire. The furniture (especially that within the mayoral office and Coronation Hall) were damaged as they were used as projectiles. In the Emperor Hall, an undetonated bomb was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Will Hermann:. ''Stadt in Ketten'', S.  250-269 ,  Aachen 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Aachen City Hall was heavily damaged by bombing raids, especially those occurring on 14 July 1943 and 11 April 1944. On 14 July 1943 the roof of the building and both towers burned, and afterwards the structure retained a distinctive shape due to the heat that twisted the steel skeletons inside the tower caps. The Coronation Hall was again heavily damaged and the north facing wall was moved in places up to 30 centimeters vertically. The imminent threat of collapse was staved off through the use of emergency beams that held the structure in place.  Because of rain penetrating the interior of the building, its frescoes were severely affected, and five of the eight were carefully removed by Franz Stiewi and stored at the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].

The architect Professor Otto Gruber and the building engineer Professor Richard Stumpf prepared a report in 1945 about the structural integrity of the building. With the help of Professor Josef Pirlet, the dilapidated north façade was reinforced with steel and tension bars, and in 1946, the building’s roof was repaired using makeshift sheets of zinc. After structural analysis was conducted and the foreground was reinforced, the replacement of the north façade had to take place, since almost all of the arches there were broken. The arches on the ground floor were again closed for repairs in 1950, and the reconstruction of the Emperor Hall was largely completed by 1953, with the configuration of the room following in the next few years.

The question of how the tower caps should be rebuilt remained at the heart of a controversial discussion. In 1966 Professor Wilhelm K. Fischer, who had worked extensively in the reconstruction of Aachen, produced a sketch for the towers’ design, as students from [[RWTH Aachen University]] also took part in the debate, submitted 24 designs for consideration. In 1968 eight additional expert designs were submitted to a working group whose task it was to rebuild the towers, and after discussing several modern looks, the group settled on a design by the [[conservation-restoration]] expert Leo Hugot, who stuck tightly to the historical image of the towers. The tower caps were finally finished in 1978.

===Present===
[[File:Aachen city hall Imperial Regalia replicas.jpg|thumb|Replicas of the Imperial Regalia]]
Today, replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] from the Viennese [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] reside in the city hall. These replicas were made around 1915 by order of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] for an exhibition to recall the 31 [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]] that took place in Aachen between 813 and 1531. Among the replicas are a copy of the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]], the [[Sabre of Charlemagne]], the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and the [[Imperial Orb]].

Since 2009, Aachen City Hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour program by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lefèvre]] are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, [[Amar Nath Sehgal]] is a renowned artist and sculptor, who created a mural in the lobby of [[Vigyan Bhawan]], Delhi on the direction of appropriate authority. In the year 1957, the Government of India commissioned Mr. Sehgal for creating a bronze mural for Vigyan Bhavan, the most prominent International Convention Hall in Delhi. The Bronze sculpture so commissioned, of about 140&amp;nbsp;ft. span and 40&amp;nbsp;ft. sweep took five years to complete and was placed on the wall of the Lobby in the Convention hall. This embellishment on a national architecture became a part of the Indian art heritage. However, in 1979, the mural was pulled down and consigned to the store room of the Union without notice or permission or authorization of Amarnath. When Mr. Sehgal came to know of this ill treatment, he made representations to the government authorities for restoration of the mural, to no avail. As this act of destruction of the mural as it was improperly handled which cause minor damage to the sculpture. He filed a petition under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in the Delhi High Court praying for an apology from the defendants, a permanent injunction on the defendants to restrain them from distorting, mutilating or damaging the plaintiff’s mural and damages to the tune of Rs. 50 lacs.

==Judgment==
The Court termed the Moral rights as the soul of the author’s works. "The author has a right to preserve, protect and nurture his creations through his moral rights. A creative individual is uniquely invested with the power and mystique of original genius, creating a privileged relationship between a creative author and his work."

The Court elucidated on the moral rights that flow from art and literary work .They are Identification right or attribution right, right to dissemination, Right to integrity that is to maintain the purity of work and right to withdraw from the publication of the work .The language of the Section 57 makes it possible to legally protect the cultural heritage of India through the moral rights of the artist. "Intellectual property and knowledge are interconnected. Intellectual property embodies traditional thought and knowledge with value addition. Thus, physical destruction or loss of intellectual property has far reaching social consequence. Knowledge which has grown with it is also lost." Court ruled that moral rights in the work of art acquire the  status of the cultural heritage of the nation and India being a signatory to many conventions , it would be the obligation of the state to protect such work.

Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 includes destruction of a work of art as a ground as it is the extreme form of mutilation and reduces the volume of the author’s creative corpus and affects his reputation prejudicially as being actionable under said section. Further, in relation to the work of an author, subject to the work attaining the status of a modern national treasure, the right would include an action to protect the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation.

The Court held that the plaintiff has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in the defendants. It was further held that the defendants have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with the defendants henceforth and ordered the defendants to pay damages with costs.

==Significance of the Decision==
The decision taken by the single bench of the Delhi High Court was instrumental in determining the course of moral rights in the country. It also gave a broad construction to the term moral rights in the country, by not only providing for the right of the author in the case of any distortion, mutilation, modification or other act in relation to the work if such distortion etc. would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation but also ‘right of the author to receive the copyrighted work for the purposes of restoration and sell it’. It included within the moral right of integrity the right to protect an artistic work from outright destruction. 
The interim decision in the case, given by Justice Jaspal Singh, given in favour of the plaintiff, restricted the Indian Government from causing any further loss to the plaintiff by destroying the property. The interim ruling, given in 1992, established two central points about the ambit of moral rights within India. Firstly, that the moral right of integrity under Indian Law can in fact protect an artistic work from outright destruction and secondly, that the Government has a duty of care towards artworks in its possession.
This gave rise to amendments in the Copyright Act in 1994. Even though the purported primary motive of the Government was to bring the Indian Act in conformity with the Berne Convention, the wording of the amendment seemed to be a direct reaction to the interim ruling.  Under the amended Section 57, a legal claim by an author against unauthorized modifications to his work had to establish that the treatment of the work has been prejudicial to his honour or reputation. The revised Section 57 corresponded to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention and also provided that failure to display a work, or to display it in accordance with the wishes of the author, would not qualify as a violation of the author’s moral rights.

In light of this amendment in 1994, an important question that Justice Nandrajog needed to address was that of which law would be applicable to the final ruling, the pre amendment or post amendment Copyright Act. There were compelling arguments for both the sides, as the old provisions of the Copyright Act would apply because they governed the time when the acts of destruction occurred, and when the case was actually filed before the court. On the other hand, he could have said that the post amended provisions should apply because they reflected the currently policy of the Govt. and were actually in force at the time of the judgment. However, he sidestepped the question and chose neither of the paths, arguing that the law must be read to fulfil the higher objective of protecting our cultural heritage, in light of the many international treaties on cultural heritage that India is a signatory to. The artwork in question constituted an ‘outstanding work of art’ and in such cases there is an overriding obligation to protect their integrity, no matter which law is applied.

Her career as a folklorist and author spanned seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;First book 1938, most recent due out with I. B.

'''''Aquis Submersus''''' ([[Latin]] for ''Drowned in the Waters'') is a [[painting]] by the [[Germany|German]] [[dada]]ist and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Max Ernst]] created in 1919. Influenced by the Italian [[metaphysical art]] it is one of Ernst's earliest works showing surrealistical accents.&lt;ref name="Städel_AquisSubmersus"/&gt; It currently resides at the Städel museum in Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;ref name="Städel_AquisSubmersus"/&gt;

The painting depicts a [[swimming pool]] surrounded by [[building]]s. The sense of dimension is unclear. The features of the buildings appear to be hand-drawn. The buildings leave [[shadow]]s against the sky like a wall. Hanging in the sky is a [[clock]] that reflects on the water as a [[moon]]. In the pool, the picture shows a possibly female or childish body in an upside-down position with only the waist and legs above the water level. The person appears to be diving or is [[drowning]]. In the foreground is an armless stature-like figure that appears to have been made out of [[clay]], throwing a shadow in the direction of the pool, similar to another shadow originating from outside the picture. The person looks away from the pool and bears a [[handlebar mustache]] resembling that of Ernst's father, but also has features which could be interpreted as female.
 
The painting carries the same name as a famous novella ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Aquis Submersus (novella){{!}}Aquis submersus|de|3=Aquis submersus}}'' by [[Theodor Storm]], published in 1876, which influenced Ernst creating his painting.&lt;ref name="Städel_AquisSubmersus"/&gt;

'''ARTEXPRESS''' is an [[art exhibition]] which is a showcase of [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] Visual Arts Examination artworks from across [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Whilst usually perceived as an exhibition of 'the best' artworks, this is not necessarily true as the chosen artworks are merely representative of the broad diversity of different artworks submitted for that year's HSC.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Although students are not so restricted in the works that are produced for the HSC,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS works must have a "G" rating.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS occurs annually in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], Sydney Olympic Park and ten other art galleries in New South Wales. The works selected for ArtExpress reflect trends in the galleries who select the works, therefore they may not represent the exemplar works from the Visual Arts Examination but needs of the gallery showing the work. Works selected may reflect trends in cost cutting, so  less complex works with fewer components and often less challenging ( or engaging ) works for the audience are given focus.

[[File:S. Bing en kimono.jpg|thumb|alt=|right|[[Siegfried Bing]] in a [[kimono]] ]]
'''''Artistic Japan''''' was a magazine of [[Japanese art]], published by German-born French art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]]. It ran for thirty-six monthly issues from 1888 to 1891 in French, English, and German editions and contributed to a revival of [[Japonism]].{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=6}}

==Background==
Art critics and collectors in Europe spearheaded a craze for Japanese art in the late 19th century; prominent promoters of this [[Japonism]] included [[Edmond de Goncourt]] (1822–96), [[Philippe Burty]] (1830–90), and [[Siegfried Bing]] (1838–1905).{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=7}}  Burty made an attempt at a magazine devoted to Japanese art that lasted a single issue.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=7–8}}

The wealthy collector and dealer Bing had placed himself at the centre of Japanese art circles in Paris;{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}} where he had relocated from Hamburg in Germany to take over a branch of the family business dealing in imports of [[French porcelain]].{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|pp=185–186}}  In the late 1870s he opened a shop selling Japanese art objects and travelled to the Far East to study art in 1880.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|p=186}}  He developed connections with art sources in Japan and amassed what was considered one of the finest Japanese art collections in the West.  He desired to spread word of Japanese aesthetics to a broad public, and used his wealth and connections to populate a new magazine to this end.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}}

==Publication==
Bing enlisted his friend, the director of the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]] [[Justus Brinckmann]] (1843–1915), to translate and print a German-language edition of the magazine.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}}  The English art dealer [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1845–1922) handled publication of an English-language that also circulated in the United States.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=9}}

The magazine aimed to educate the public, and enjoyed high-quality printing featuring reproductions drawn from private collections.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=19}}  Each issue had several colour [[tipped-in page]]s of reproductions of Japanese artwork such as paintings or [[ukiyo-e]] prints.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  It featured essays on Japanese art and art history by critics such as Burty, de Goncourt, and {{illm|Louis Gonse|fr}}, drawn from Bing's wide circle of acquaintances in the art world.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=12–13}}  The articles examined a wide variety of Japanese arts: [[Japanese architecture|its architecture]], [[Japanese painting|painting]], [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock printing]], [[Japanese pottery|pottery]], and even [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]].{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=14–15}}  Bing also drew attention to the high aesthetic quality of everyday objects such as combs, tea ladles, and fabrics.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|pp=186–187}}

==Reception and legacy==
Bing made effort to have  ''Artistic Japan'' widely reviewed.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=9}}  It received positive reviews throughout the West, as far away as Scandinavia and the US.  The London-based periodical ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'' praised its first issue's "attractiveness".  The American ''The Critic'' rated it "among the highest class of art-journal".{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  The established reputations of the contributing writers to which Bing had access contributed to the magazine's quick acceptance as an authority.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=13}}

The vogue for Japanese art had reached a peak by the time the magazine appeared.  French artist and collector of Japanese art [[George Auriol]] expressed hope that the magazine would rekindle an appreciation of its true aesthetic qualities in the face of its brimming commercialization.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=9–10}}  The ''Japan Weekly Mail'' newspaper ran regular denigrating reviews of the magazine's reproduction and writing quality{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=10}} and Bing's understanding of Japanese history and society.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=11}}

The magazine benefited Bing as a dealer, as prices for Japanese artworks rose with awareness of their value; this was one aim of Bing's, and he attracted some criticism for it.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=10}}  The magazine's reproductions served as models to Western graphic designers.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  Gabriel&amp;nbsp;P. Weisberg has asserted that ''Artistic Japan'' was a major force in solidifying the valued position Japanese art was to have in the West.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=19}}  The aesthetic quality of the magazine itself won lasting recognition; in 1906 [[Gustav Klimt]] obtained a complete run.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|p=187}}

'''Asian-American theatre''' is [[theatre]] written, directed or acted by [[Asian Americans]]. From initial efforts by four theatre companies in the 1960s, Asian-American theatre has grown to around forty groups today. Early productions often had Asian themes or settings, but today it is becoming more common to see Asian-Americans in roles that defy the stereotypes.

== Background ==
Asian-American theatre emerged in the 1960s and the 1970s with the foundation of four theatre companies: [[East West Players]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] (later renamed Asian American Theater Company) in [[San Francisco]], Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (later renamed Northwest Asian American Theatre) in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] in [[New York City]].  The Northwest Asian American Theatre was one of the first in the Pacific Northwest. The four companies have provided the resources and opportunities to actors, writers, directors, designers, and producers to pursue and define ''Asian-American theatre'' for over five decades.  By the end of the 1990s, the number of Asian-American theatre companies and performance groups grew to about forty.  In addition, such companies helped integrate Asian-Americans into many popular theatre companies by normalizing Asian actors. Asian-American plays have appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatres]] and have received major awards both nationally and internationally. Asian-American actors have used Asian-American theatre companies as their artistic bases while pursuing careers in the mainstream theatre, film and television. Alternative forms of theatre and performance such as multimedia performance, [[One man show|solo performance]] and [[spoken word]] have also shaped Asian-American theatre. In the beginning, participants of Asian-American theatre were mostly of [[East Asia]]n descent, but in the 1990s and the 21st century, more artists of [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n and backgrounds have joined the community and have made Asian-American theatre one of the fastest growing and changing sectors in [[Theater in the United States|American theatre]].

== Asian-American theatre companies ==
[[East West Players]] (EWP) was founded in 1965 by a group of actors who wanted to fight racism in the entertainment industry by creating non-stereotypical roles for Asian Americans. Led by the [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-American]] actor [[Mako (actor)|Mako]], the actors at EWP first saw theatre as a venue to showcase their talent for television and film producers and directors, but by the early 1970s, the EWP began to actively sponsor original plays by Asian Americans. [[Frank Chin]], who founded the Asian American Theatre Workshop, argued that Asian-American actors needed Asian-American playwrights to create believable roles and to end dependence on the mainstream acting industry.  Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (TEA) began in 1974 on the campus of the [[University of Washington]], and after the founding students graduated, moved into a theatre in the International District, renaming them selves the Asian Exclusion Act. The theatre group moved around several locations before finding a home at the Theatre Off Jackson. It was late renamed again as the Northwest Asian American Theatre (NWAAT).  In addition to acting and playwriting, NWAAT emphasized community activism and became a cultural center for Asian Americans in Seattle; many of the plays they performed were directly targeted at expressing the painful history of discrimination Asian-Americans in America suffered after the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].  [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] (Pan Asian Rep), on the other hand, emerged as part of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre in 1978. Founded by [[Tisa Chang]], Pan Asian Rep became the representative Asian-American theatre company in New York City and introduced Asian-American plays to the East Coast audiences.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian-American theatre companies were founded with more diverse purposes and styles.  Companies such as [[Ma-Yi Theater Company]] (New York City) focus on producing new, original plays, as did the now-defunct [[Lodestone Theatre Ensemble]] (Los Angeles, 1999-2009). Others companies' agendas departed greatly from the original four: National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) in New York City, for instance, stages canonized Western plays with all Asian cast and [[Mu Performing Arts]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] incorporates Asian theatrical styles to specifically cater to local audiences.

== Asian-American actors ==
American theatre in the 1950s was dominated by popular [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows that featured Asian characters and settings, and shows such as ''[[The King and I]]'' and ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' provided employment to a number of "[[Oriental people|Oriental]]" actors.  However, many roles were blatantly stereotypical and racist and many major roles were cast with white actors with facial makeup resembling an "Oriental".  The popularity of Asian themes in Broadway shows did not continue through the 1960s, and "Oriental" actors found themselves unemployed in large numbers.  While they were out of work, they observed white actors getting cast in Asian roles.  "Oriental" actors began to protest this practice by creating activist organizations and creating work for themselves.  The term "Asian-American actor" emerged in the late 1960s when the '''[[Asian American movement]]''' challenged the racist history of the label "Oriental."  By the 1970s, Asian-American actors were well organized in their fight for jobs and positive images for Asians.  In New York, an activist group called Oriental Actors of America regularly protested openings of shows with white actors playing Asians.  In Los Angeles, [[East West Players]] became the most visible venue for Asian-American actors to find acting employment and to participate in activism.  The company's proximity to [[Hollywood]] attracted many ambitious and talented Asian-American actors to Los Angeles.  By the mid-1990s, over 75% of all Asian-American actors had acted on the stage of EWP.

In the early 1990s, the controversy over the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' surfaced when Asian-American actors protested the casting of the British actor [[Jonathan Pryce]] for the role of the half-[[Vietnam]]ese Engineer in the Broadway production of the musical.  The protest was led by many prominent Asian-American theatre artists, including actor [[BD Wong]], the artistic director of Pan Asian Rep, Tisa Chang, and the playwright [[David Henry Hwang]].  Asian-American actors initially lost their fight when the musical opened on Broadway with Pryce, but in the long run, the controversy generated many positive aftereffects for Asian-American actors.  The musical's ten-year run on Broadway employed an unprecedented number of Asian-American actors, and the role of the Engineer was subsequently cast with Asian-American actors.

Asian Americans have won the fight for employment, and while some roles for them stereotype those of Asian descent, Asian Americans are increasingly winning roles that respect and tolerate Asian Americans from the majority of producers who are realizing the reality of [[racial bigotry]] and ignorance that brings hostility and degradation to those oppressed.

== Asian-American playwrights ==
Before the 1960s, Asian-American plays were virtually non-existent, but various initiatives, including East West Players' playwriting contest, encouraged Asian-American writers to adapt their [[short story|short stories]] and [[novel]]s into plays and to write original plays.  The first wave of Asian-American playwrights included [[Wakako Yamauchi]], Momoko Iko, Edward Sakamoto, [[Hiroshi Kashiwagi]], and [[Frank Chin]].  Common themes in plays by first wave writers were Asian-American history, [[generation conflict|generational conflict]], [[cultural identity]], [[cultural nationalism]], and [[family history]].  In 1972, Frank Chin's ''[[The Chickencoop Chinaman]]'' became the first Asian-American play to be produced in New York City, and since then, Chin has become a major [[spokesperson]] for Asian-American playwriting.  He founded the [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] in San Francisco to promote original playwriting by Asian Americans.  The most commercially successful Asian-American play was [[David Henry Hwang]]'s play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', which became the first Asian-American play to be produced on Broadway and won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 1988.  The success of ''M. Butterfly'' created a national interest in Asian-American plays, and regional theatre companies around the country began to produce plays by Hwang and other second wave Asian-American writers such as [[Philip Kan Gotanda]] and [[Velina Hasu Houston]].  Such interest also promoted the publication of first anthologies of Asian-American plays in the early 1990s.  The mainstreaming of Asian-American plays increased with works by third wave writers such as Diana Son, Sung Rno, [[Han Ong]], [[Chay Yew]], [[Rick Shiomi]], and [[Ralph Peña]].  These third wave writers felt that race and ethnicity were mere jumping off point in addressing multifaceted experiences of being an Asian American and wrote about any topic that interested them.  All three waves of Asian American playwrights continue to produce works that define not only Asian-American theatre, but also American theatre and global theatre.

== Alternative theatre and performance ==
One of the pioneers of Asian-American [[Experimental theatre|alternative theatre]] is [[Ping Chong]], a [[Chinese American]] [[multimedia artist]] who has created [[Experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]] since the early 1970s.  He has used visual effects, sound control, dance, [[Mime artist|mime]], spectacle, and other methods based on the sensibilities of [[Cantonese opera]].  Another form of alternative theatre is [[One man show|solo performance]].  Often written, directed, and acted by one performer, solo performance has provided many Asian-American artists with the opportunity to voice their experiences.  Solo performers, such as [[Dan Kwong]], [[Denise Uyehara]], Jude Narita, and [[Lane Nishikawa]], have toured with their shows and have introduced Asian-American theatre to audiences in all parts of the country.  Group performances have also toured, especially to colleges and universities.  Often comedic, group performances, such as Slant Performance Group and the '''18 Mighty Mountain Warriors''', have been popular amongst college students, many of whom saw Asian-American performers onstage for the first time.  Recently, [[spoken word]] groups have become the newest form of Asian-American theatre and performance.

== Asian-American Theatre Conference and Festival ==
In June 2006, ''Next Big Bang:'' The First Asian-American Theatre Conference was held in Los Angeles, spearheaded by East West Players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/quill_naatf_review_2007.asp Festival a Milestone for Asian American Theater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219132559/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/quill_naatf_review_2007.asp |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in June 2007 with the first ever National Asian American Theatre Festival, held in New York City.

'''Benham's top,''' also called '''Benham's disk,''' is named after the English newspaper-man, amateur scientist, and toymaker [[Charles Benham]], who in 1895 sold a [[top]] painted with the pattern shown. When the disk is spun, arcs of pale color, called [[Fechner colors]] or pattern-induced flicker colors (PIFCs), are visible at different places on the disk. Not everyone sees the same colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2656082/What-colour-YOU-Dizzying-optical-illusion-creates-different-shade-viewer-no-one-knows-why.html |title=What colour can YOU see? Dizzying optical illusion creates a different shade for every viewer - but no-one knows why |publisher=''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' |author=Ellie Zolfagharifard |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benham was inspired to propagate the Fechner color effect through his top after his correspondence with [[Gustav Fechner|Dr. Gustav Theodor Fechner]], who had observed and demonstrated the said effect. Benham's top made it possible for speakers of the English language to learn of the Fechner color effect, about which Fechner's original reports were written in German.

The phenomenon is not entirely understood. One possible reason people see colors may be that the [[color receptors]] in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. More specifically, the latencies of the center and the surrounding mechanisms differ for the different types of color-specific ganglion cells.

The phenomenon originates from neural activity in the [[retina]] and spatial interactions in the [[primary visual cortex]], which plays a role in encoding low-level image features, such as edges and spatiotemporal frequency components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Campenhausen C, Schramme J |title=100 years of Benham's top in colour science |journal=Perception |volume=24 |issue=6 |year=1995 |pages=695–717 |doi=10.1068/p240695 |pmid=7478909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that the blue-yellow [[opponent process]] accounts for all the different PIFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schramme J |title=Changes in pattern induced flicker colors are mediated by the blue/yellow opponent process |journal=Vision Research |volume=32 |issue=11 |year=1992 |pages=2129–34 |doi=10.1016/0042-6989(92)90074-S |pmid=1304090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benham's top and other PIFCs are being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye and the visual track.

[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Third Volume of a 1727 edition of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' printed by Jacob Tonson]]

A '''biography''', or simply '''bio''', is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or [[curriculum vitae]] ([[résumé]]), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.

Biographical works are usually [[non-fiction]], but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the [[genre]] known as biography.

An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''[[autobiography]]''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or [[ghostwriter]].

== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kendall}}

=== Historical biography&lt;!--'Historical biography' redirects here--&gt; ===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|right|Einhard as scribe]]

One of the earliest biographers was [[Cornelius Nepos]], who published his work ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]], or the generals [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is [[The Twelve Caesars|''De vita Caesarum'']] ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by [[Suetonius]], written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]].

In the early [[Middle Ages]] (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Hermit]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[priest]]s used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the [[Church Fathers|church father]]s, [[martyr]]s, [[pope]]s, and [[saint]]s. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]] (see [[Hagiography]]). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the [[Vita Karoli Magni|life of Charlemagne]] by his courtier [[Einhard]].

In [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic Civilization]] (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of [[Muhammad]] and other important figures in the early [[history of Islam]] began to be written, beginning the [[Prophetic biography]] tradition. Early [[Biographical dictionary|biographical dictionaries]] were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of these early examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.{{sfn|Nawas|2006|p=110}}

[[File:Foxe's Book of Martyrs - Frontispiece (1761).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', was one of the earliest English-language biographies.]]
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of [[monarch|king]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[tyrant]]s began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by Sir [[Thomas Malory]]. The book was an account of the life of the fabled [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Following Malory, the new emphasis on [[humanism]] during the [[Renaissance]] promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century and the gradual increase in [[literacy]].

Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by [[Thomas Fuller]]'s ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.

Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC ''A General History of the Robberies &amp; Murders of the most Notorious Pirates'', by Charles Johnson]. Introduction and commentary by [[David Cordingly]]. Conway Maritime Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American biography followed the English model, incorporating [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}{{sfn|Stone|1982}}{{clear}}

=== Emergence of the genre ===
[[File:James Boswell of Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|[[James Boswell]] wrote what many consider to be the first modern biography, ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', in 1791.]]

The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters [[Samuel Johnson]] published in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |title=James Boswell's 'Life of Johnson': The First Modern Biography |last=Butler |first=Paul |date=19 April 2012 |website=University of Mary Washington Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111164251/http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |archive-date=11 November 2014 |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern [[genre]] of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the [[English language]]. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |date=16 May 2013 |title=James Boswell: The Man who Re-Invented Biography |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-22540020 |website=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar [[hagiography|hagiographical]] method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of [[saint]]s produced in [[Medieval era|Medieval]] times. A distinction between mass biography and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and [[middle-class]] culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable [[paperback]] editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. [[Periodical]]s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}

[[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Literary Gossip |newspaper=The Week |location=Toronto |date=6 December 1883 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=13 |url = https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n7/mode/1up |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), philosophers, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], churchmen – [[John Henry Newman]] – and entertainers – [[P. T. Barnum]].

=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century’s biographies.{{sfn|Stone|1982}} The demise of the [[Great man theory|"great man"]] theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through [[Darwinian]] theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of [[psychoanalysis]] led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy.{{sfn|Casper|1999}} The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.

[[File:Eminent Victorians title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' set the standard for 20th century biographical writing, when it was published in 1918.]]
British critic [[Lytton Strachey]] revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the [[Victorian era]]: [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Thomas Arnold]], and [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Levy (journalist) |date=20 July 2002 |title=A String Quartet in Four Movements |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strachey set out to breathe life into the [[Victorian era]] for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortège'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes....of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Jones |first1=Malcolm |date=28 October 2009 |title=Boswell, Johnson, &amp; the Birth of Modern Biography |url=http://www.newsweek.com/boswell-johnson-birth-modern-biography-81357 |magazine=Newsweek |location=New York |issn=0028-9604 |access-date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included [[Gamaliel Bradford (biographer)|Gamaliel Bradford]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Emil Ludwig]], among others. [[Robert Graves]] (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By [[World War I]], cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."

The feminist scholar [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun|Carolyn Heilbrun]] observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of [[Feminism|feminist]] activism. She cited [[Nancy Milford|Nancy Milford's]] 1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because "[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] had destroyed [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of [[May Sarton|May Sarton's]] ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."{{sfn|Heilbrun|1988|pp=12, 13}}

===Recent years===
In recent years, [[multimedia]] biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary [[biographical film]]s, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[The Biography Channel]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].

CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist [[Ralph Ueltzhoeffer]]. Media scholar [[Lev Manovich]] says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways.{{sfn|Manovich|2001|p=220}} General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=159}}

In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, [[Hermione Lee]] argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Stephen Frears|Frears, Stephen]]; [[Katie Derham|Derham, Katie]]; [[Hermione Lee|Lee, Hermione]]; [[Ray Monk|Monk, Ray]] |title=The Art of Life: Are Biographies Fiction? |url=http://iai.tv/video/the-art-of-life |publisher=Institute of Arts and Ideas |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.{{sfn|Regard|2003}}

Daniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Meister, "The biographical turn and the case for historical biography" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical research===
[[Biographical research]] is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".{{sfn|Roberts|2002}} The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions", which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked".{{sfn|Zinn|2004|p=3}} This method can be used to understand an individual’s life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.

=== Critical issues ===
There are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:
{{cquote| The problems with such conventional biographies are manifold. Biographies usually treat the public as a reflection of the private, with the private realm being assumed to be foundational. This is strange given that biographies are most often written about public people who project a ''persona''. That is, for such subjects the dominant passages of the presentation of themselves in everyday life are already formed by what might be called a ‘self-biofication’ process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Paul |title=Closing Reflections: Confronting Contradictions in Biographies of Nations and Peoples |journal=Humanities Research |date=2013 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=124 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3231040/Confronting_Contradictions_in_Biographies_of_Nations_and_Persons_2013_}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''British Inspiration Awards''' (BIAs) are a set of industry awards celebrating achievement in the [[creative industries]] of the United Kingdom, organised by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]]. The inaugural awards took place at a ceremony in London on 23 April 2010. The awards, in the shape of a gold statue of [[Boudica]], were presented in a number of categories including art, design, entertainment, fashion and science. All proceeds of the awards are to be donated to various charities.

==History==
With the UK in a recession in the late 2000s, and with a steadily declining manufacturing industry and little natural resources, the creative sector was believed to be the basis for future growth, and was as of 2010 was estimated to already contribute £110billion to the economy per annum, contribute two million jobs, and number over businesses classed as creative.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;

The BIAs were initiated by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the opinion that "The UK is the creative capital of the World" and it was "about time that the UK creative sector was recognised for its achievements".&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the belief that, although a world leader in the creative industries, Britain had a tendency to understate its achievements, and thus sought to correct that.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt; The BIAs were therefore created to recognise those who have already contributed to Great Britain's "economic, social and artistic development through creative endeavor", and highlight the opportunities Britain offered in the creative industries.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAHome/&gt;

On the eve of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]] campaign, on 16 March 2010 the BIAs attracted the support of the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] and Liberal Democrat Party leader [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewStatesman8Apr2010/&gt; The inaugural BIAs were to be presented in a daytime ceremony at The Brewery near [[Barbican Centre]] in London on 23 April 2010 ([[St George's Day]]).&lt;ref name=BIAEvent/&gt; The nominees in each category were announced on 14 April 2010.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010PrintEdition/&gt;

Attendees of the ceremony, hosted by [[Richard Madeley]], included nominees David Arnold, Michael Eavis and Gareth Pugh, as well as [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Ant and Dec]], [[Helen Skelton]] and [[Andy Akinwolere]].&lt;ref name=AttendeesWireImages/&gt;

==The Award==
The BIA is given "In recognition of an individual, company or groups contribution to the Creative Economy of Great Britain and the Inspiration that they give to others".&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Individual awards are to be presented in categories for the Film; Television; Music; Fashion; Arts; Design; Innovation, Enterprise and Industry; Science and Technology; and Interactive Entertainment industry sectors, as well as a Special Recognition award.&lt;ref name=BIACategories/&gt;

The BIAs use the symbol of [[Boudica]] as their logo and award. Described by the BIA organisers as a "forward looking woman who inspired others around her",&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Boudica was a queen of the ancient tribe of the [[Iceni]] of present-day [[Norfolk]], who in AD 60 or 61 led them and neighbouring tribes in a revolt against the authority of [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the [[Governors of Roman Britain|Roman Governor of Britain]], before ultimately being defeated.

The award itself is a gold statue of the stylised version of Boudica depicted in the BIA logo.&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; The logo shows this stylistic representation of Boudica moving forward using four shades of colour, symbolising England, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] "moving forward together as one."&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt;

'''''Cauchemar Blanc''''' ([[English language|English]]: '''''White Nightmare''''') is a 1991 [[short film]] by [[Matthieu Kassovitz]], based on the comic written for the screen by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cauchemar Blanc|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/518888/White-Nightmare/|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
One winter's night in France, four [[racism|racists]], J.P., Berthon, Barjout, and René, set out to [[assault]] a local [[Arab]] man. The four follow him to a [[vacant]] [[parking lot]] outside of an [[apartment building]], but the [[car]] they are in suddenly starts smoking, causing them to crash into a [[phone booth]]. Barjout is knocked [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], but the others are unharmed. As the remaining three are about to attack the quite fearless (albeit defenseless) Arab, a woman in the building threatens to call the [[police]].

Impersonating a police-officer, J.P. heads into the building to assuage the situation. When an [[Afro-French]] denizen accuses J.P. of lying, he becomes angered and begins insulting him, only to discover that the [[black people|black]] man is a police [[commissioner]]. Meanwhile, Berthon and Rene are keeping watch of the Arab man. When René begins showing off his "skills" with [[nunchucks]], one of the sticks detaches and hits Berthon in the head, knocking him out cold. 

As René tries to resuscitate Berthon, Barjout regains consciousness and decides to investigate what has happened. Upon seeing an apprehended J.P., Barjout threatens the black man at gunpoint. When J.P. tries to tell him that he is a commissioner, Barjout accidentally opens fire and kills J.P. Suddenly, he hears the disembodied voices of Berthon and J.P., and now the Arab man is speaking in René's voice. Barjout awakens, realizing the events were nothing more than a [[nightmare]] he had while waiting in the car. The film ends with the four men beating and presumably killing the helpless Arab man.

'''David Locke Hall''' is a highly decorated former [[Assistant United States Attorney]], [[Naval Intelligence]] officer, and author.

==Early life==
Hall was born in [[California]] in 1955.  He received a BA from [[Dartmouth College]], an MBA from [[Yale]], and JD and MA degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  After law school, Hall served as a law clerk to the Honorable [[Walter King Stapleton]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].

==Career==

===Assistant United States Attorney===
Hall served for 23 years with the [[United States Department of Justice]] as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]], retiring in 2013.  He tried a large number of significant cases to verdict, including mobster Roy Stocker of the [[K&amp;A Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Slobodzian,"Federal Jury Convicts 3 In Drug Ring", The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall also prosecuted the Leath Cocaine Trafficking Organization, the leaders of which were involved in shooting Philadelphia Police Officer Donald McMullin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386/pdf/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386-2.pdf; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/266613/OFFICER-HOPES-TO-WORK-BESIDE-HIS-TWIN-AGAIN.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

A significant focus of Hall's prosecutorial career was the investigation and prosecution of weapons proliferation and technology transfer offenders.  In the 1990s, he prosecuted the Armaments Corporation of South Africa ([[Armscor (South Africa)|Armscor]]), Kentron, Fuchs Electronics, and others for violations of the Arms Export Control Act during the [[apartheid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/616104/After-35-years-US-lifts-S-Africa-arms-embargo.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARMSCOR case was a significant point of contention between the United States and the Republic of South Africa because ARMSCOR and Kentron were state-owned corporations.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-01/news/mn-602_1_south-africa; https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/02/21/us-refusal-to-drop-case-against-s-african-firm-causes-friction/2d1fc0c2-e314-4a0f-a049-f398b64bcf9c/&lt;/ref&gt;  After lengthy negotiations, the dispute was resolved by the pleas of ARMSCOR, Kentron, and Fuchs to criminal charges and the payment of fines in excess of $11 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2009, Hall investigated and prosecuted Amir Ardebili, an Iranian arms procurement agent working in Shiraz, Iran, acquiring components for the F4, F14, and other military aircraft, as well as microchips for use in phased array radar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-iran/iranian-pleads-guilty-to-u-s-arms-trafficking-charges-idUSTRE5B15JU20091202&lt;/ref&gt;  The years long investigation resulted in an undercover meeting between Ardebili and U.S. agents on October 1 and October 2, 2007 in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, where Ardebili was arrested by Georgian authorities.  He was extradited to the United States in January 2008.  Ardebili pled guilty to violations of the Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, smuggling, conspiracy and money laundering in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/file/438491/download&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ardebili case is the subject of a book, Operation Shakespeare: The True Story of an Elite International Sting, written by John Shiffman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Operation-Shakespeare/John-Shiffman/9781451655162&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2013, Hall led the undercover investigation and prosecution of Xiang Li, a Chinese software pirate. Xiang Li's Chengdu, China-based operation sold over $100 million in cracked software products with multiple high-tech applications, including telecommunications, explosive simulation, aerospace, satellite tracking, and flight simulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/business/chinese-man-pleads-guilty-in-copyright-violation-case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The undercover investigation led to a meeting on Saipan between federal agents and Xiang Li in June 2011.  At that meeting, Xiang Li delivered 20 gigabytes of proprietary data hacked from a defense contractor.  Xiang Li was charged with trafficking in more than $100 million in stolen copyrighted software.  He pled guilty in January 2013 and in June 2013 was sentenced to 12 years incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2013/130108wilmington2.pdf;  https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USDHSICE/2013/06/11/file_attachments/217734/Crack_99_Sentencing_Memorandum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has testified before the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives on "Examining the Effectiveness of the Kingpin Designation Act in the Western Hemisphere."&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-examining-effectiveness-kingpin-designation-act-western-hemisphere/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hall also served as the Special Prosecutor for the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team. During this time, he worked closely with FBI Special Agent [[Robert King Wittman]].  Hall negotiated the return of three stolen [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings from Brazil in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/us/national-briefing-midwest-minnesota-stolen-rockwell-paintings-found.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he led the successful undercover investigation and prosecution of Marcus Patmon, an art thief who sold stolen works by [[Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2009/ba100209c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hall forfeited and returned to Iraq a collection of Mesopotamian artifacts in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2010/ba102510a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hall affected the return to Peru of a gold Moche monkey head (circa 300 A.D.) that had been looted from the royal tombs of Sipan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/peruvian-artifact-repatriated&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hall seized and forfeited the Rosenberg Diary, the long-lost diary of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], Nazi propagandist and Reich Minister for the occupied eastern territories. The Rosenberg Diary is now part of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Museum]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-de/pr/long-lost-rosenberg-diary-recovered&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Service===
Hall served in the [[United States Navy]] and Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer for thirty years.  Commissioned in 1984, he retired at the rank of Captain in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents2/NAVADMINS2/NAV2005/NAV05204.txt&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded three intelligence units and served with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], in addition to numerous Navy commands.  He was a third generation naval officer, his father having served as a Marine Corps officer with the [[Second Marine Division]] in [[World War II]].

The '''''Descent from Mount Sinai''''' is a fresco  by the Italian [[Renaissance]] painter [[Cosimo Rosselli]] and his assistants, executed in 1481–1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
On 27 October 1480, several [[Florence|Florentine]] painters  left for Rome, where they had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as spring 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there. Rosselli brought with him his son-in-law, [[Piero di Cosimo]], who perhaps collaborated on this painting and at least one of the others assigned by his master.

The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as well as a continuity between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

==Description==
The painting, like others in the cycle, shows more episodes at the same time; the theme is described by the inscription on the frieze ''PROMULGATIO LEGIS SCRIPTE PER MOISEM. In'' ("Promulgation of the Written Law through Moses").

In the upper part is Moses kneeling on Mount Sinai, with a sleeping Joshua nearby: he receives the [[Tables of the Law]] from Yahweh, who appears in a luminescent cloud, surrounded by angels. In the foreground, on the left, Moses brings the Tables to the [[Israelites]]. In the background is camp of tents, with the altar of the [[golden calf]] in the middle; the Israelites,  spurred by Aaron, are adoring it: the position of some of them, painted from behind, was usually used for negative characters, such as Judas Iscariot in the ''Last Supper''. Once seeing that, Moses, in the center, gets angry and breaks the Tables on the ground. On the right background is the punishment of the idolatrous and the receiving of the new Tables.  Joshua, in the blue and yellow, appears with Moses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3507">The '''Destruction in Art Symposium''' (DIAS) was a gathering of a diverse group of international artists, poets, and scientists to [[London]], from 9–11 September 1966. Included in this number were representatives of the [[Counter-culture|counter-cultural]] underground who were there to speak on the theme of destruction in art.

The Honorary Committee, led by [[Gustav Metzger]], attracted the attention of both the international media and international art community to the symposium.&lt;ref name="TateDIAS"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-60s-was-tomorrow/exhibition-themes/destruction-art-symposium Destruction in Art Symposium], Art &amp; The 60s: This was Tomorrow, Tate Britain, retrieved 2006-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The symposium was held at the [[Africa Centre]] in [[Covent Garden]], London.

==Objectives==
A DIAS press release claimed: 
{{cquote|The main objective of DIAS was to focus attention on the element of destruction in Happenings and other art forms, and to relate this destruction in society.|author=DIAS&lt;ref name="TateDIAS" /&gt;}}

==Happenings==
Throughout September, [[Happenings]] took place in venues all over London, including Conway Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miki|title=Yoko Ono at the Destruction In The Art Symposium (DIAS) from "DIAS - Photofeature" by John Prosser in "Art and Artists" October, 1966|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mickeyono2005/6318888303|website=Flickr|publisher=Flickr|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TateDIAS" /&gt;

==Description and context==
The painting depicts a [[dachshund]] on a [[leash]] and the feet of a lady walking it, both in rapid motion as indicated by the [[motion blur|blurring]] and multiplication of their parts.&lt;ref name="lubbock"/&gt;

Chronophotographic studies of animals in motion, created by scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts—perhaps in an effort to imitate these mechanical images.&lt;ref name="lubbock"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lubbock|first1=Tom|title=Great Works: Dynamism of A Dog on a Leash (1912) Giacomo Balla|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/great-works-dynamism-of-a-dog-on-a-leash-1912-giacomo-balla-1781174.html|accessdate=20 July 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="art_story"/&gt; Such multiplication can be seen in [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', painted the same year as Balla's painting.&lt;ref name="lubbock"/&gt;

Balla's interest in capturing a single moment in a series of planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography.&lt;ref name="art_story"/&gt; In later, more abstract works created during [[World War I]], Balla used planes of color to suggest movement.&lt;ref name="brittanica"/&gt;

The decomposition of movement into moments in time which Balla created in ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' likely inspired the photodynamic technique of Futurist photographer [[Anton Giulio Bragaglia]].&lt;ref name="bossaglia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bossaglia|first1=Rossana|title=Astrattismo|date=1990|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=9788809761476|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E6q3McWxMuEC|accessdate=22 July 2016|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was exhibited in the [[Galerie Der Sturm]]'s Autumn Salon in [[Berlin]] from September to December 1913, accompanied by a photograph.&lt;ref name="Berghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berghaus|first1=Günter|title=International Yearbook of Futurism Studies 2014|date=21 May 2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110334104|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQPpBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caws"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caws|first1=Mary Ann|title=Manifesto: A Century of Isms|date=1 December 2000|publisher=[[Bison Books]]|isbn=9780803264236|page=xxx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKONAETXi-kC|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold by the artist in 1938 to the industrialist [[Anson Goodyear|Anson Conger Goodyear]]. Upon his death in 1964, Goodyear bequeathed the painting jointly to his son, George F. Goodyear, with a [[life interest]], and to the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The gallery acquired the painting in December 1984.&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinamismo di un cane al Guinzaglio, 1912|url=https://www.albrightknox.org/artworks/196416-dinamismo-di-un-cane-al-guinzaglio-dynamism-dog-leash|website=Albright-Knox Art Gallery|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical responses==
In 1943, artist Cornelia Geer LeBoutiller criticized the painting, comparing it unfavorably with Duchamp's ''Nude Descending a Staircase'' (a work with which it is often compared&lt;ref name="lubbock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayakawa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wagner"/&gt;) and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', calling Balla's work "more crude, less mature, almost childish indeed ... Balla takes himself and his dog so seriously, so studiedly, that it is doubtful that any pleasure has ever come out of it anywhere; certainly no movement has."&lt;ref name="LeBoutillier"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeBoutillier|first1=Cornelia Geer|title=Art as Communication|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Fall 1943|volume=2|issue=8|pages=75–84|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806170819/http://libarch.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/GenofondUA/19013/e773bdc66ca18d80fce3395516c74624.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1947, critic Henry R. Hope called ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' "a cliché of modern art".&lt;ref name="Hope"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hope|first1=Henry R.|title=Black Magic and Modern Art|journal=[[Art Journal (College Art Association journal)|College Art Journal]]|date=Winter 1947–48|volume=7|issue=2|pages=116–120|doi=10.2307/772677|jstor=772677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Geoffrey Wagner declared Balla's painting to be anathema to the [[Vorticism|Vorticist]] aesthetic of British painter [[Wyndham Lewis]], who criticized Futurism for its "romantic excess" and dynamism.&lt;ref name="wagner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Geoffrey|title=Wyndham Lewis and the Vorticist Aesthetic|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=September 1954|volume=13|issue=1|page=11|jstor=427013|doi=10.2307/427013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[S. I. Hayakawa]] credited Balla's "classic" for its introduction of the time dimension in its representation of its subject.&lt;ref name="Hayakawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayakawa|first1=S. I.|authorlink1=S. I. Hayakawa|title=The Revision of Vision: A Note on the Semantics of Modern Art|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|date=Summer 1947|volume=4|issue=4|pages=258–267|jstor=42581524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, art critic Tom Lubbock considered the painting "one of the most striking" chronophotography-inspired works, pointing to several features which create a comical effect: the "abrupt close-up" on a trivial subject—a "twee prim sausage dog"—which might have been a single detail in an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] street scene; the [[wikt:bathetic|bathetic]] juxtaposition of the word ''dynamism'', "with its connotations of heroism, of the mighty modern machine world" against that subject; the cropping of the owner at the knee, giving a dog's view (and anticipating ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons); and the apparently frenetic motion of the dog's limbs and tail coupled with the stillness of its body, suggesting little forward progress. Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as "creating new sensations and new phenomena", and evoking the motion of [[shuffling|shuffling cards]] and the embodiment of [[ghost]]s.&lt;ref name="lubbock"/&gt;

In 2014, art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]] declared ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'', along with [[Gino Severini]]'s paintings ''Blue Dancer'' and ''Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin'', to be "probably the most elegant and accurate works ever painted in the Futurist tradition." He credits these works with "moving status into kinesis, stillness into motion, and thus giving life to culture, bringing it back from the bucolic ornaments of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Robert C.|authorlink=Robert C. Morgan|title=Italian Futurism, or the Lessons of Art and Politics|url=http://hyperallergic.com/114611/italian-futurism-or-the-lessons-of-art-and-politics/|website=Hyperallergic|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence outside art==
A 2002 research paper on [[machine vision]] by [[computer science|computer scientists]] Roman Goldenberg, [[Ron Kimmel]], Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'', to illustrate the mathematical representation of [[periodic motion]] using a small number of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenshapes]].&lt;ref name="goldenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldenberg|first1=Roman|last2=Kimmel|first2=Ron|last3=Rivlin|first3=Ehud|last4=Rudzsky|first4=Michael|title=`Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash' or Behavior Classification by Eigen-decomposition of Periodic Motions|journal=Proceedings of the 7th European Conference on Computer Vision|date=May 2002|pages=461–475|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911135055/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/people/romang/online-publications/mobacl_ECCV.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Niue]]''' was adopted on 15 October 1975. It consists of the [[Union Jack]] in the upper left corner with a star in the middle of the Union Jack and four stars forming a diamond around it. It is very unusual for a flag based on a [[British ensign]] design, in having not only a yellow background, but also a [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] Union Jack in the [[canton (flag)|canton]].&lt;ref&gt;William Crampton (1994) ''The World of Flags'', Rand Mcnally {{ISBN|0528837206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
From the ''Niue Flag Act 1975'': "The Niue National Flag shall be a golden yellow flag, bearing on the upper canton of the hoist thereof the Union Flag, commonly known as the Union Jack, displaying 2 five-pointed yellow stars on the vertical line and on the horizontal line thereof separated by a blue disc containing a larger five-pointed yellow star." &lt;ref name="Flag Act 1975"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Niue Flag Act 1975 | publisher = Government of Niue | series = Niue Laws | volume = 3 | year = 2006 | url= http://www.gov.nu/wb/media/Volume%203.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The symbolism represented by the flag is described in the Act.  The Union Jack symbolises the protection granted by the United Kingdom in 1900 after petitioning by the Kings and Chiefs of Niue. The yellow field symbolizes "the bright sunshine of Niue and the warm feelings of the Niuean people towards New Zealand and her people."&lt;ref name="Flag Act 1975" /&gt; The association with New Zealand, which took over responsibility and administration of Niue in 1901, is also represented by the four small stars that depict the Southern Cross. Finally the blue disc containing a larger star represents the deep blue sea surrounding the self-governing island of Niue.&lt;ref name="Flag Act 1975" /&gt;

'''''Handbook of Latin American Studies''''' is an annotated guide to publications in Latin American studies by topic and region, published since 1936. Its editorial offices are in the Hispanic Division of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to a Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Studies Materials (SALALM) report, “The Handbook of Latin American Studies is the oldest and most prestigious area studies bibliography in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/hlas/salalm.html accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It now publishes in both print and digital format.

The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'' (HLAS), a multidisciplinary bibliographic project, grew out of a 1935 meeting held at the [[Social Science Research Council]] offices in New York City.  The [[American Council of Learned Societies]] provided the initial funding for the project via its Advisory Committee on Latin American Studies.  [[Lewis Hanke]], Director of the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress, became its first editor.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clarence H. Haring]] of the History Department, Harvard University chaired the committee that led to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence H. Haring, “The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'', reprinted in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965'' 2 vols. Austin:  University of Texas Press 1965, vol. 1, pp.251-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the project initially was provided by the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', pp. 114-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliography of the Handbook is selective, not comprehensive, with annotated entries on the most important publications on the particular topic. Each field has an introductory overview of trends by a contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;Charmino Shelby, “The ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'': Its First Fifteen Years.” Reprinted In ''Latin American  History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching'', vol. 1, pp. 252-256.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specialists who serve as contributing editors play an important role in shaping the field. “Every evaluation that a Contributing Editor makes may have far-reaching consequences for the future of a publication," with the inclusion or exclusion of a publication and the phrasing of the annotation influencing scholars and librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan A. Haverstock, “Handbook of Latin American Studies’’, Nos. 1-21.” Reprinted in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching'', vol. 1, pp. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of sections on Brazil reflects the increased awareness in the U.S. of its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the tenure of Hispanic Foundation Director [[Howard F. Cline]] (1952–71), HLAS expanded the number of topics, with volumes alternating by year between humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/hlas/salalm.html accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending a period of uncertainty in its funding, the Library of Congress assumed the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Since volume 50, HLAS has been published in digital format, with the Library of Congress hosting HLAS Online.  Hispanic Division Director Dr. Georgette Dorn began the project of digitizing earlier print volumes of HLAS.  Publications considered for inclusion are monographs, journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, websites, and maps written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, or Russian.&lt;ref&gt;http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division-and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic-collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MKGKakiemonMeissen4045.jpg|thumb|Meissen teapot of c. 1725, painted in [[Delft]] c. 1730]]

In [[pottery]] '''hausmaler''' ({{Lang-de|home painter}}) is a term for the artist, the style, and the pieces in '''hausmalerei''', the process of buying pieces of pottery as plain "blanks", and then painting them in small workshops, or the homes of painters, before a final firing. In European pottery of the 17th to 19th centuries this was at certain times and places a significant part of production, and the decoration could be of very high quality.
 
Hausmalerei began with freelance [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ers on glass in [[Bohemia]] but developed in [[Germany]] on white [[tin-glazed earthenware]] in the 17th century, when glazed and fired but unpainted wares "in the white" were purchased on speculation by unsupervised freelance ateliers of [[china painting|china painters]], who decorated them in [[On-glaze decoration|overglaze enamel colours]] and [[gilding]], which were fixed by further firing in their own kilns. A few such freelance decorators of [[faience]] operated in  [[Nuremberg]] in the late 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming and Hugh Honour, ''Dictionary of the Decorative Arts'' (1977)''s.v.'' "Hausmaler".&lt;/ref&gt; but ''hausmalerei'' developed in [[Augsburg]] into a notable feature of [[tin-glazed earthenware]] production during the early 18th century, before the workshops turned entirely to [[porcelain]]. 

''Hausmalerei'' reached a artistic pinnacle with paintings on [[Meissen porcelain]] and [[Vienna porcelain]] in the second quarter of the 18th century; sometimes Meissen porcelains remained blank for decades before they were painted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamor.co.uk/Meissen-dish-with-Hausmalerei-decoration-DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=6&amp;tabindex=5&amp;objectid=575282 M tray, ''ca'' 1730, with ''hausmalerei'' of ''ca'' 1750.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many painters and workshops have distinctive styles; a few were amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 93-94, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the production of [[Sèvres porcelain]] was tightly controlled, so that painting was under strict factory control. By contrast, [[Limoges porcelain]] has always maintained a strong tradition of ''atelier'' decoration, whether near Limoges or at Paris.

In England, among independent porcelain-painters of the mid-18th century, [[William Duesbury]] went on to manufacture porcelain as a founder of the [[Royal Crown Derby]] and owner of manufactories at [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]], [[Chelsea porcelain factory|Chelsea]], [[Derby porcelain|Derby]] and [[Longton Hall]].  In England, America and elsewhere, [[China_painting#Victorian_era_amateurs|china painting became a popular hobby]] or semi-professional pastime in the mid-19th century, normally for ladies, and many factories sold blanks.  The 204-piece [[Canadian Historical Dinner Service]] of 1897 represents a peak of this trend, with 16 female artists, most from middle-class backgrounds, taking part in decorating the service.

Traditions of ''hausmalerei'' were never wholly extinguished. The founder of [[Heinrich &amp; Co]] began as a ''hausmaler'', purchasing porcelain blanks until he set up his own kilns ''ca'' 1903.  From 1930 the Czech ''hausmaler'' Josef Kuba (1896-1972) maintained an atelier in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], Czech Republic, and later in [[Wiesau]], Bavaria. supplied by various porcelain manufacturers in Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porcelainmarksandmore.com/germany/bavaria/wiesau-01/index.php Porcelain Marks &amp; More: Wiesau]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disturbances of the [[Russian Revolution]] many pre-revolutionary blanks of the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg]] were painted by artists as long as ten years later, in bold new [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] styles; such pieces are now highly sought-after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=78466 example in the British Museum], blank from 1912, painted 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese [[Canton porcelain]] of the 18th and 19th centuries used a similar system, but on a larger scale. The blanks were [[Jingdezhen porcelain]] which was carried the considerable distance to [[Guangzhou]] before being decorated.

'''''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men''''' is a 1985 [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] designed to raise awareness about hunger in Africa. Proceeds from the comic went to the [[American Friends Service Committee]], to assist in their work on behalf of  [[Africa]]n [[famine]] relief and recovery. Published in the form of a "[[comic jam]]," or [[exquisite corpse]], the book featured an [[all-star]] lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as [[Stephen King]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Edward Bryant]]. It also saw a rare [[Alan Moore]] Marvel Comics credit outside his early [[Marvel UK]] work.

''Heroes for Hope'' featured some memorable artist/writer and penciler/inker pairings, including [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]]; [[Stephen King]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]]; Moore and [[Richard Corben]]; [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]; [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], [[Howard Chaykin]] inked by [[Walt Simonson]]; and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] reuniting on the X-Men.

== Publication history ==
''Heroes for Hope'' came about in response to the devastating [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 223|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Horrified by the plight of starving children in Africa, writer/artist Jim Starlin and illustrator Bernie Wrightson convinced Marvel to publish ''Heroes For Hope''. It was a 'jam' book...and all of Marvel's profits were donated to famine relief in Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was in the spirit of contemporaneous [[benefit concert|musical fund-raisers]] like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", [[USA for Africa]]'s "[[We Are the World]]", and the [[Live Aid]] concerts. Then-Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] described the genesis of the project this way:

{{quote|One night, a few months ago, artist [[Jim Starlin]] called me at home to propose an idea that his friend and fellow artist [[Berni Wrightson]] had suggested to him — that Marvel Comics publish a special issue of ''The X-Men'', a benefit book for famine relief in Africa. Jim and Berni wanted to do the book as a "jam," with as many artists and writers contributing, which would enable us to bring a small army of outstanding talents together on the project, making it a real event. I thought it was a great idea. The next morning I pitched it to Publisher [[Mike Hobson]] and President [[Jim Galton]]. . . . Jim and Berni recruited the artists. [[Chris Claremont]] . . . quickly volunteered to recruit writers, and to help . . . coordinate the entire project.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;Shooter, Jim. Afterword, ''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men'' (Marvel Comics, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to the contributors donating their work for the project, so did logo designer [[Janet Jackson (comics)|Janet Jackson]] and Marvel's production staff; while [[Curtis Circulation Company]] and all the [[direct market]] distributors and [[comics specialty shop]]s donated their profits.&lt;ref name="afterword" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The comic book opens with [[Rachel Summers]] poking her head out of the [[X-Mansion]] to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the entrance to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.

After retrieving the comatose mail carrier, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] senses that all is not right, and claws him in the face. But it turns out that it was all an illusion. The X-Men go back to business as usual after this fiasco, but then things begin to go wrong. One by one, a series of psychic assaults is launched on each member of the team, as they are subjected to their greatest subconscious fears.

First [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (with art by Byrne and Austin) is mocked by steely apparitions of his teammates. This is more than he can bear, and he curls up in a [[fetal position]]. [[Kitty Pryde]], as told by King, Wrightson, and inker [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeff Jones]], goes to grab something from the refrigerator only to be surprised by an evil Death-type being in a cloak. He exposes Kitty's great fear of going hungry. As told by [[Bill Mantlo]], [[Charles Vess]], and [[Jon J Muth]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] finds Kitty turned into a wizened old hag, which leads to his own experience, focusing on [[Christian]] imagery and moral dilemmas. Kurt is offered the chance to sacrifice himself so that one other person might breath the air and eat the food he would. He declines, and thinks himself a coward. Thanks to Moore and [[Richard Corben]], the next to fall prey to the spiritual onslaught is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who is offered a glimpse of a world where his dream of mutant supremacy has been realized — and that it's not all it's cracked up to be. Rachel is swept back to her past, where she's confronted by a horde of mutant-hunting [[doppelgänger]] [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], reminding her of her part in that dystopian future. Wolverine, by Ellison, Miller, and inker Sienkiewicz, must confront the tension between his human and animal sides. Claremont, [[Brian Bolland]], and [[P. Craig Russell]] depict [[Ororo|Storm]] confronted by a carnival ringmaster, who traps her in a [[house of mirrors]]. She is shown various images of her possible self, each one more distorted than the last. Ororo gets drawn into the crazy carnival games, and in the first concrete expression of the story's theme, she realizes that it is wrong to waste food. Having defeated the psychic attacker by feeding illusory cream pies to illusory people, Storm returns to her teammates for discussion of what has transpired.

Courtesy of Rachel's powers, the X-Men track the psychic presence that's been harassing them to the continent of Africa. They fly the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] to the source, where they are met with horrible scenes of deprivation. Before long, a fleet of [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft arrive, full of supplies, which the X-Men help distribute.

That night, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] becomes so frustrated that she has not had her turn of psychic punishment yet that she decides to hunt down the entity herself. She sneaks around the campsite stealing her teammates' powers. Using the psychic powers of Rachel Summers, the Rogue hybrid traces the presence of the X-Men's harasser to a desert hideaway. Upon entering the crypt, Rogue is attacked by the avatar of the psychic being. Things are not going well for Rogue when Storm appears to give aid. The "entity" is revealed to be a primeval god-force that feeds on human despair. One by one, the X-Men awake from their Rogue-induced comas and join in the battle.

The X-Men finally defeat the entity and return to their campsite, where they resume the enormous task of feeding the starving refugees. They realize their battle with the entity was a metaphor for the fight against famine, and indeed any human struggle. Kitty expresses fear that the entity survived the battle and is ready to strike again, but Wolverine comforts her with words of hope.

[[File:Jaan! in Hakui.jpg|thumb|An example of Japanese sound symbolism, "''jaan!''"]]
'''Ideophones''' are words that evoke an idea in sound, often a vivid impression of certain sensations or sensory perceptions, e.g. sound ([[onomatopoeia]]), movement, color, shape, or action. Ideophones are found in many of the world's [[language]]s, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, and Zulu list thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/handle_gakui/D1004724|title=A Grammar of Sound-Symbolic Words in Japanese: Theoretical Approaches to Iconic and Lexical Properties of Japanese Mimetics|last=Akita|first=Kimi|publisher=Kobe University|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word class of ideophones is sometimes called ''phonosemantic'' to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like '[[verb]]' or '[[noun]]'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of [[linguistics]], ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; though a recent surge of interest in [[sound symbolism]], [[iconicity]] and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Imai &amp; Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by [[Clement Martyn Doke]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Doke 1935 as cited in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or intensity.}}

Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words – words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb ''to tinkle'', which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, in [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]],  ''kpuk '''a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: ''loɓoto-loɓoto'' 'large animals plodding through mud', ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion', ''pɛɗɛŋ-pɛɗɛŋ'' 'razor sharp'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideophones are often characterized as [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[Sound symbolism|sound-symbolic]] words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann 1927&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reduplication]] figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.&lt;ref&gt;Watson in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. [[Welayta language|Welayta]], [[Yir-Yoront language|Yir-Yiront]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Korean language|Korean]]), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. [[Mundang]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin|first=William J.|year=1971|title=Survey of Bantu ideophones|url=|journal=African Language Studies|volume=12|pages=130–168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English "ta-da!" or Japanese {{Nihongo||ジャーン|jaan|ta-da}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Diffloth 1972&lt;/ref&gt; However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese ''Taro wa &lt;u&gt;sutasuta to&lt;/u&gt; haya-aruki o si-ta'' 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk ''sutasuta''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Sotaro|year=1997|title=Two-dimensional semantic analysis of Japanese mimetics|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=35|pages=379–415|via=|doi=10.1515/ling.1997.35.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kunene in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to [[interjection]]s: direct expressions of emotions like "Wow!" or "Ouch!". However, they are distinct in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameka|first=Felix K.|year=1992|title=Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=18|pages=101–118|via=|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(92)90048-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations ''of'' events than responses ''to'' events. An ideophone like Gbaya ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself.

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. [[narrative]] contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Noss in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ideophones can be freely used in all [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Examples==

===[[English language|English]]===

* ''boing''; the sound of a spring being released
* ''boom''; the sound of an explosion
* ''bang''; the sound of a gunshot
* ''[[bling-bling]]''; glitter, sparkle
* ''pitter-patter''; the sound of rain drops
* ''swish''; the sound of swift movement
* ''splish-splash''; the sound of water splashing
* ''ta-daa!''; the sound of a [[fanfare]]
* ''thud''; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground
* ''tick-tock''; the sound of time passing
* ''twinkle''; the glow of something sparkling or shiny

===[[Japanese language|Japanese]]===
{{main article|Japanese sound symbolism}}
The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called ''mimetics''. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication [[rendaku|may become voiced]] if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.

* ''doki doki'' ({{lang|ja|ドキドキ}}) &amp;mdash; heartbeat: excitement
* ''kira kira'' ({{lang|ja|キラキラ}}) &amp;mdash; glitter
* ''shiin'' ({{lang|ja|シーン}}) &amp;mdash; silence
* ''niko niko'' ({{lang|ja|ニコニコ}}) &amp;mdash; smile

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39965">'''Immersion''' into [[virtual reality]] is a perception of being physically [[Presence (telepresence)|present]] in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other [[Stimulation|stimuli]] that provide an engrossing total environment.

The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of [[wikt:submerge|submersion]] applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" ([[Maurice Benayoun]]) or "immersant" ([[Char Davies]])'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete [[suspension of disbelief]], enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.

[[File:Head-mounted display and wired gloves, Ames Research Center.jpg|right|thumb|Classic [[Virtual reality]] HMD]]
According to [[Ernest W. Adams]], author and consultant on [[game design]],&lt;ref name=ernest&gt;{{cite web | last =Adams | first =Ernest | title =Postmodernism and the Three Types of Immersion | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | date =July 9, 2004 | url =http://designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | accessdate =2007-12-26 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071024225651/http://www.designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | archivedate =October 24, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; immersion can be separated into three main categories:

;Tactical immersion
:Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel "in the zone" while perfecting actions that result in success.

;Strategic immersion
:Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities.

;Narrative immersion
:Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie.

Staffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in ''Patterns In Game Design'',&lt;ref name=bjork&gt;{{cite book | last =Björk | first =Staffan |author2=Jussi Holopainen | title =Patterns In Game Design | publisher =Charles River Media | year =2004 | page =206 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IFQfyODK4wAC }} | isbn =1-58450-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; divide immersion into similar categories, but call them '''sensory-motoric immersion''', '''cognitive immersion''' and '''emotional immersion''', respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category:

;Spatial immersion
:Spatial immersion occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really "there" and that a simulated world looks and feels "real".

Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original "[[telepresence]]", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's '''subjective sensation''' of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature.&lt;ref name=barfield&gt;{{cite book | last=Barfield | first=Woodrow | last2=Zeltzer | first2=David | last3=Sheridan | first3=Thomas | last4=Slater | first4=Mel | editor1-last=Barfield | editor1-first=Woodrow | editor2-last = Furness, III | editor2-first=Thomas A. | title=Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design | chapter=Presence and Performance Within Virtual Environments | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1995 | page=473 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OLE-4j3tHi0C}} | isbn=0195075552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.&lt;ref name=Thornson&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thornson | first1=Carol | last2=Goldiez |first2=Brian | date=January 2009 | title=Predicting presence: Constructing the Tendency toward Presence Inventory | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 |journal=International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=62-78 | doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 | access-date= 19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to [[Oculus VR]], the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|title=Oculus Rift Dev Kit 2 now on sale for $350|author=Seth Rosenblatt|date=19 March 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328041627/http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/oculus-rift-dk2-hands-on-and-first-impressions-19321282/|title=Oculus Rift DK2 hands-on and first-impressions|work=SlashGear}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|title=Announcing the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2)|author=|date=|website=oculusvr.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913045405/http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Abrash]] gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in 2014.&lt;ref name="Abrash"&gt;Abrash M. (2014). ''[http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf What VR could, should, and almost certainly will be within two years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320175550/http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf |date=2014-03-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the VR research team at [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], all of the following are needed to establish presence.
* A wide field of view (80 degrees or better)
* Adequate resolution (1080p or better)
* Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less)
* A high enough refresh rate (&gt;60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 95&amp;nbsp;Hz is enough but less may be adequate)
* Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.)
* Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology)
* Optical calibration
* Rock-solid tracking – translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side
* Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)

== Immersive virtual reality ==
[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|thumb|The [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]]]]
'''Immersive virtual reality''' is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as [[virtual reality]] art projects, for the most part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of immersion in an [[Simulation|artificial]] environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in [[consensus reality]].

=== Direct interaction of the nervous system ===
The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the [[virtual reality]] in the [[nervous system]] directly. In [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]/conventional [[biology]] we interact with [[consensus reality]] through the [[nervous system]]. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses.
It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated [[nerve]] impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the [[virtual reality]]. Natural impulses between the body and [[central nervous system]] would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A [[feedback]] system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.

=== Requirements ===
;Understanding of the nervous system
A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The [[Blue Brain Project]] is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models.

;Ability to manipulate [[Central nervous system|CNS]]
The [[nervous system]] would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Manipulation could occur at any stage of the nervous system – the spinal cord is likely to be simplest; as all nerves pass through here, this could be the only site of manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[Molecular nanotechnology]] is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

;Computer hardware/software to process inputs/outputs
A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from consensus reality and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.

== Immersive digital environments ==

[[File:COSMOPOLIS.jpg|right|thumb|Cosmopolis (2005), [[Maurice Benayoun]]'s Giant Virtual Reality Interactive Installation]]
An '''immersive digital environment''' is an [[Simulation|artificial]], [[interactive]], computer-created [[cut scene|scene]] or "world" within which a user can immerse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 48-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with [[virtual reality]], but without the implication that actual "reality" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of [[reality]], but it could also be a complete fantasy [[user interface]] or [[abstraction]], as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated "[[universe]]". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the [[User (computing)|user]] is dependent on many factors such as believable [[3D computer graphics]], [[surround sound]], interactive user-input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment – effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting.

=== Perception ===
To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real.  [[Immersive technology]] can perceptually fool the senses through:
* Panoramic 3D displays (visual)
* Surround sound acoustics (auditory)
* Haptics and force feedback (tactile)
* Smell replication (olfactory)
* Taste replication (gustation)

=== Interaction ===
Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner.  Various [[immersive technologies]] such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements.  Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.

=== Examples and applications ===
Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example:  which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance.

[[Computer games]] from simple arcade to [[massively multiplayer online game]] and training programs such as [[Flight simulator|flight]] and [[Driving simulator|driving]] simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the [[Virunga Mountains]] in [[Rwanda]] that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of [[mountain gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html pulseworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505131611/http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the [[heart]] to witness the buildup of [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]] and thus learn about [[cholesterol]] and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usagainstathero.com/arteryexplorer/index.aspx|title=Thank You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with scientist, artists like [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Donna Cox]], [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[Robbie Cooper]], [[Maurice Benayoun]],
[[Char Davies]], and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations.

Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]], and the use of [[virtual reality headset]]s for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.

==== Use in medical care ====

New fields of studies linked to the immersive virtual reality emerges every day. Researchers see a great potential in virtual reality tests serving as complementary interview methods in psychiatric care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0036240| title = The use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to predict the occurrence 6 months later of paranoid thinking and posttraumatic stress symptoms assessed by self-report and interviewer methods: A study of individuals who have been physically assaulted| journal = Psychological Assessment| volume = 26| issue = 3| pages = 841| year = 2014| last1 = Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Antley | first2 = A. | last3 = Ehlers | first3 = A. | last4 = Dunn | first4 = G. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = C. | last6 = Vorontsova | first6 = N. | last7 = Garety | first7 = P. | last8 = Kuipers | first8 = E. | last9 = Glucksman | first9 = E. | last10 = Slater | first10 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detrimental effects ==

[[Simulation sickness]], or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|title=Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness|publisher=Polygon|date=|accessdate=2015-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142134/http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motion sickness]] due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.&lt;ref&gt;So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T. (1999) "Cybersickness: An Experimental Study to Isolate the Effects of Rotational Scene Oscillations." Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality '99 Conference, March 13–17, 1999, Houston, Texas. Published by IEEE Computer Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Other behavioural changes such as stress, [[Virtual Reality Addiction|addiction]], isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side-effects caused by immersive virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043150/http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuba textiles''' are unique in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], formerly [[Zaire]], for their elaboration and complexity of design and surface decoration. Most textiles are a variation on rectangular or square pieces of woven [[palm leaf]] fiber enhanced by geometric designs executed in linear [[embroidery]] and other stitches, which are cut to form pile surfaces resembling velvet. Women are responsible for transforming raffia cloth into various forms of textiles, including ceremonial skirts, ‘velvet’ tribute cloths, [[headdress]]es and [[basketry]].

==Raffia cloth==

In [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] culture, men are responsible for [[raffia]] palm cultivation and the weaving of raffia [[cloth]].&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of raffia cloth are produced for different purposes, the most common form of which is a plain woven cloth that is used as the foundation for decorated textile production. Men produce the cloth on inclined, single-heddle looms and then use it to make their clothing and to supply foundation cloth to female members of their clan section. The cloth is coarse when it is first cut from the loom, so it is then pounded in a mortar, which softens it and renders it ready for the application of surface decoration, for which women are responsible.&lt;ref name="Darish 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darish|first=Patricia|title=Iowa Studies in African Art|year=1990|publisher=University of Iowa Press|location=Iowa City|authorlink=Dressing for Success: Ritual Occasions and Ceremonial Raffia Dress among the Kuba of south-central Zaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darish 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darish|first=Patricia|title=Cloth and Human Experience|year=1989|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=117–140|authorlink=Dressing for the Next Life: Raffia Textile Fabrication and Display among the Kuba|editor=Annette B. Weiner and Jane Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twool==
Many prestige weavings are dyed with ''twool'', a deep red substance obtained from the heartwood of the tropical trees ''Pterocarpus sp.'' and ''Baphia pubescens''.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moraga|first=Vanessa Drake|title=Weaving abstraction : Kuba textiles and the woven art of Central Africa|year=2011|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780874050363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuba believe that ''twool'' is imbued with magical and protective properties. When mixed with palm oil, it creates a pomade that is applied to the face, hair and body in a ritual context. According to oral tradition, the Pende were responsible for teaching the Kuba how to weave textiles; the Pende used twool to die their prestige clothes for death rituals.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;

=="Bambala" fabrics==
Early 20th Century ethnographer Emil Torday acquired the oldest group of extant textiles from the Kuba tradition from the reigning king, Kot aPe. He called these textiles "Bambala" after the ruling clan.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt; According to Joseph Cornet, these cloths were embroidered by Bushong women who were pregnant with the King's heirs for use in rituals surrounding the birth of the children.&lt;ref name="Cornet 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Art Royal Kuba|year=1982|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also used as funerary regalia for noble women. The slight sculptural relief, elaborate geometric designs and technical cohesiveness of the textiles indicate that they were created by highly skilled elders. According to art historian Vanessa Drake Moraga, "That Kuba embroiderers represented textile structures in their compositions underscores both the value of weaving to the culture and the prestige attached to women art."&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;

==Women's ceremonial overskirts==
[[File:Woman's ceremonial overskirt, Bushong people, 20th century, raffia palm fiber &amp; bark cloth, HMA.JPG|thumb|Bushong woman's ceremonial overskirt from the 20th century.]]
Kuba women traditionally wore overskirts during burial displays, but the overskirt was later adopted as part of many ceremonial ensembles worn during ritual dances, celebrations and masked performances. The wraparound skirt was secured with a belt and worn over a typically monochrome red or white embroidered skirt. These skirts exhibit a variety of design components; some skirts employ flat linear embroidery exclusively, while others employ this technique exclusive on the borders of the fabric, in which case the interior is executed with [[Cut pile|cut-pile embroidery]], which lends the surface a "plush" appearance and feel.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;  In the cut-pile embroidery technique, short raffia strands are individually inserted with a needle under one or more warps or wefts of a plain-woven raffia panel, then cut close to the surface at each end to produce the raised "pile."&lt;ref name="Adams 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Moni|title=Kuba Embroidered Cloth|journal=African Arts|year=1978|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textile weaving boasts a variety of motifs, such as [[guilloche]] interlace, which embroidery artists employed along with color, line and texture to yield varied compositions and visual effects.

==Pattern and repetition: Kuba textiles as they relate to mathematics and music==
[[File:WLA haa Raffia Cloth Kuba.jpg|thumb|Kuba cloth from early-mid 20th century, currently at the Honolulu Academy of Arts.]]

[[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] textiles demonstrate a taste for interrupting the expected line; they compose through juxtapositions of sharply differing units and abrupt shifts of form.

Mathematician Donald Crowe has analyzed, in particular, the two-dimensional designs of [[Benin art|Benin]], [[Yoruba art|Yoruba]] and [[Kuba art]]s and has shown the extent of the Africans' explorations into the formal possibilities of [[geometric]] variation.&lt;ref name="Crowe 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowe|first=Donald W.|title=Symmetries of culture : theory and practice of plane pattern analysis|year=1998|publisher=Univ. of Washington Press|location=Seattle [u.a.]|edition=3rd printing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83s_kCXOPO4C&amp;pg=PR4|isbn=9780295970844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philipgouldcollection.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/kuba-weaving/|title=Kuba weaving|date=2010-01-29|website=The Philip Gould Collection|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their art, the Kuba have developed all the geometric possibilities of [[Frieze group|repetitive variations of border patterns]], and of the seventeen ways that a design can be [[Wallpaper group|repetitively varied on a surface]], the Kuba have exploited twelve. This exploration does not mean that they confine themselves to repetitive patterning in confronting a surface to be decorated.

The character of Kuba design accords with Robert Thompson's observation that some African music and art forms are enlivened by [[Off-beat (music)|off-beat]] phrasing of accents, by breaking the expected continuum of surface, by staggering and suspending the pattern.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=R. F.|title=African Art in Motion|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In textile design, the Africans of the Kasai-Sankuru region do not project a composition as an integrated repetition of elements. Until recently, Euro-American attitudes on this point were so fixed that they called a textile design a "repeat," and expected to find a unit of identical imagery repeated over the surface. This kind of integration is not typical for African two-dimensional arts.&lt;ref name="Adams 1978"/&gt;

'''''Madame de La Carlière,''''' sub-titled ''On the inconsequence of public judgement of our actions,'' is a fable written by the French writer [[Denis Diderot]] in 1772, and published for the first time in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Œuvres complètes de [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] éditées par [[Jacques-André Naigeon|Naigeon]], Paris, Desray, 1798.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceded by ''[[Ceci n'est pas un conte|This is not a fable]]'' and followed by ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville|Supplement to the Voyage of Bougaineville]]'', it forms a [[triptych]] of moral fables written in 1772&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] indicated the end of his revisions in a letter to [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm]] dated the  23 September 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; that would appear in the Literary Correspondence in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;For more details on this triptych, we may read the introduction written for the article consecrated in the first volume, ''This is not a fable.''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Madame de La Carlière'' takes its name from the mother of Sophie Volland, Élisabeth Françoise Brunel de La Carlière.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Trousson, Denis Diderot, Paris, Tallandier, 2005, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, ''Madame de La Carlière'' was performed as a stage piece alongside Diderot's novel ''Rameau's Nephew'' at [[New York University]], as part of a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]].&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;Bernstein, Richard, "This Time, Bicentennial Is France's," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 29, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minyan ware''' is a broad [[Archaeology|archaeological]] term describing varieties of a particular style of [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] burnished [[pottery]] associated with the [[Middle Helladic]] period (c. 2000/1900–1550 BC). The term was coined in the 19th century by [[Germans|German]] archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] after discovering the pottery in [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], [[Greece]]. Excavations conducted during the 1960s confirmed that Minyan ware evolved from the burnished pottery developed by the [[Tiryns]] culture of the Early Helladic III period (c. 2200/2150–2000/1900 BC).

==Term==
In the history of Aegean prehistoric archaeology, [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was the first person to coin the term "Minyan" after he discovered a distinct variety of dark-burnished pottery at [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]] (the mythical home of King [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "The term "Minyan" was originally coined by Schliemann very early in the history of Aegean prehistoric archaeology and applied to a distinctive variety of dark-burnished pottery which he had found at Orchomenos, the home of the mythical king Minyas."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his contemporaries referred to the pottery as "Orchomenos Ware".&lt;ref name=Drews12/&gt; However, the term "Minyan Ware" ultimately prevailed since it romantically recalled the glorious (though tenuous) [[Minyans]] of [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name=Drews12&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1994|loc=p. 12: "Although some of his contemporaries referred to it prosaically as "Orchomenos Ware," the name that prevailed was Schliemann's more romantic Minyan Ware, which recalled the glorious but tenuous Minyans of Greek mythology."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
At first, [[Alan Wace]] and [[Carl Blegen]] did not yet associate Minyan Ware with the "advent of the Greeks".&lt;ref name=Drews12*/&gt; Both archaeologists regarded the sudden appearance of Minyan Ware as one of two interruptions in the unbroken evolution of Greek pottery from the [[Neolithic]] up until the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean era]].&lt;ref name=Drews12*/&gt; Ultimately, they concluded that "Minyan Ware indicates the introduction of a new cultural strain."&lt;ref name=Drews12*&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1994|loc=pp. 12–13: "In their 1918 article, Blegen and Wace did not yet associate Minyan Ware with "the coming of the Greeks." They did observe, however, that the sudden appearance of Minyan Ware at the beginning of the Middle Helladic period was one of only two interruptions in the otherwise unbroken evolution of pottery on the Greek mainland from neolithic times to the Mycenaean Age. The only other interruption, they found, was the advent of Minoan and Minoanizing pottery at the beginning of the period they called Late Helladic. Wace and Blegen concluded that "Minyan Ware indicates the introduction of a new cultural strain," but they did not yet identify this new strain with the Greeks. However, since there were only two interruptions in the Bronze Age pottery sequence, and since the second of these had to do with the Minoans, the only alternative was to tie the Greeks' arrival in Greece to the appearance of Minyan Ware."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1960, Minyan Ware was often associated with northern invaders having destroyed [[Early Helladic]] culture (1900 BC) and introducing [[Middle Helladic]] culture into the Greek peninsula. However, [[John L. Caskey]] conducted excavations in Greece (i.e. [[Lerna]]) and definitively stated that Minyan Ware was in fact the direct descendant of the fine gray burnished pottery of Early Helladic III Tiryns culture. Caskey also found that the Black or Argive variety of Minyan Ware was an evolved version of the Early Helladic III "Dark slipped and burnished" pottery class.&lt;ref name=RutterA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caskey|1960|pp=285–303}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Minyan Ware was present in Greece since between 2200 and 2150 BC. There is nothing particularly "northern" regarding the ceramic progenitors of Minyan Ware. The exception, however, entails the spread of Minyan Ware from central Greece to northeastern Peloponnese, which can be seen as "coming from the north" with respect to the Peloponnese. Currently, there is uncertainty as to how Minyan Ware arrived in central Greece or how it was indigenously developed.&lt;ref name=RutterA&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "Until about 1960, Gray Minyan was often identified as the pottery of northern invaders who destroyed EH civilization ca. 1900 B.C. and introduced MH material culture into the Greek peninsula. However, Caskey's excavations at Lerna as well as more recently excavated sequences at several other sites have made it abundantly clear that Gray Minyan, rather than being new in the MH period, is the direct descendant of the fine gray burnished pottery of the EH III Tiryns culture. Moreover, it seems likely that the Black/Argive variety of Minyan is nothing other than an evolved version of the EH III "Dark slipped and burnished" class. Thus Minyan pottery, if it is to be associated with an intrusive population element at all, must be connected with an EH III "invasion" ca. 2200/2150 B.C. and not with a MH one ca. 1900 B.C. Furthermore, there is nothing particularly "northern" about the ancestry of the EH III progenitors of MH Minyan except that they almost certainly came to the northeastern Peloponnese from central Greece (i.e. from the north with respect to the Peloponnese). How they arrived, or alternatively developed indigenously, in central Greece is a question which has yet to be resolved."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and styles==
[[File:Myken M 091020.jpg|thumb|[[Amphora]], MHIII, c. 1700-1600 BC]]
Minyan Ware is a form of monochrome burnished pottery produced from extremely fine or moderately fine clay. Varieties of Minyan Ware entail Yellow, Red, Gray, and Black (or Argive).&lt;ref name=RutterB/&gt; Open forms such as goblets and kantharoi are the most common shapes in all types of Minyan Ware. Goblets and kantharoi are technically evolved versions of the Bass bowl and kantharos of the Early Helladic III Tiryns culture.&lt;ref name=RutterB&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "The monochrome burnished pottery manufactured from moderately to extremely fine clays which is presently described as "{Minyan ware}" can occur in Gray, Black (or Argive), Red, and Yellow varieties. The most common shapes in all varieties of Minyan are open forms, for the most part goblets and kantharoi which are clearly recognizable as evolved forms of the Bass bowl and kantharos of the EH III Tiryns culture."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray Minyan Ware, specifically, has angular forms that may reflect copies of metallic prototypes.&lt;ref name=RutterC/&gt; However, such a theory is difficult to substantiate given the fact that metallic objects from the Middle Helladic period are rare and metallic vessels are almost non-existent.&lt;ref name=RutterC/&gt; Yet, the angular forms of this particular pottery style may in fact be derived from the common use of the fast potter's wheel.&lt;ref name=RutterC/&gt; "Ring stems" (or highly ribbed pedestal feet) are an important characteristic of Middle Helladic II and Middle Helladic III Gray Minyan Ware in central Greece.&lt;ref name=RutterC/&gt; Of course, this characteristic is also present on Middle Helladic III Yellow Minyan Ware goblets from [[Corinth]] and the [[Argolid]]. During the final phase of the Middle Helladic period, shallowly incised rings more or less replaced goblet feet and "ring stems" in northeastern Peloponnese.&lt;ref name=RutterC&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "The crisply articulated, angular forms of Gray Minyan vases in particular have given rise to the theory that they are copies of metallic prototypes, despite the fact that metal objects of any kind are relatively rare during the MH period and metal vessels are virtually non-existent. The angular profiles of Gray Minyan vases are in fact probably due simply to the common utilization of the fast wheel in their production. High, ribbed pedestal feet ("ring stems") are particularly characteristic of MH II-III Gray Minyan in central Greece, although they are also attested on MH III Yellow Minyan goblets in the Argolid and Corinthia. In the final phase of the MH period in the northeastern Peloponnese, goblet feet become considerably lower and the ribs disappear in favor of shallowly incised rings."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minyan Ware from the Middle Helladic I period is decorated in the form of grooves on the upper shoulder of kantharoi and bowls.&lt;ref name=RutterD/&gt; During the Middle Helladic II period, stamped concentric circles and "festoons" (or parallel semicircles) became a common characteristic of decoration especially on Black (or Argive) Minyan Ware.&lt;ref name=RutterD&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "Decoration of Minyan during MH I usually takes the form of grooving on the upper shoulder of bowls and kantharoi. During MH II, incised parallel semicircles ("festoons") and stamped concentric circles also become quite common, especially on Black/Argive Minyan."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of production==
Gray Minyan Ware is mostly found in central Greece and is also common in the Peloponnese during the Middle Helladic I and Middle Helladic II periods.&lt;ref name=RutterE/&gt; Black (or Argive) Minyan Ware is common in northern Peloponnese and is mostly decorated with stamped and incised ornaments.&lt;ref name=RutterE/&gt; Red Minyan Ware is commonly found in [[Aegina]], [[Attica]], the northern [[Cyclades]] and [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref name=RutterE/&gt; Yellow Minyan Ware first appears during the Middle Helladic II and Middle Helladic III periods.&lt;ref name=RutterE/&gt; Due to its light surface color, this particular variety of pottery is decorated with dark matt-paint.&lt;ref name=RutterE/&gt; This has led archaeologists to regard Yellow Minyan Ware as "Matt-Painted" instead of "Minyan".&lt;ref name=RutterE&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|loc=[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/9.html Lesson 9: Middle Helladic Greece]: "Gray Minyan is most common in central Greece, but is also frequent, especially in MH I–II, in the Peloponnese. Black/Argive Minyan is above all characteristic of the northern Peloponnese and is the variety of Minyan most commonly decorated with incised and stamped ornament. Red Minyan is most commonly found in Attica, Boeotia, Aegina, and the northern Cyclades. Yellow Minyan first appears in later MH II or in MH III. Because of its light surface color, this last variety is often decorated with dark, matt paint, in which case it is treated by archaeologists as Matt-painted rather than as Minyan."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatolian Grey Ware==
Pottery very similar to Grey Minyan Ware is known in [[Anatolia]], dated around 14th–13th centuries BC.&lt;ref name="Pavúk"&gt;{{harvnb|Pavúk|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "North-West Anatolian Grey Ware" should be used for this type of pottery.&lt;ref name="Pavúk"/&gt; Around 2002, the term "Anatolian Grey Ware" was used by scholars.&lt;ref name="Pavúk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12000">'''Objectif Exhibitions''' (vzw) is a not-for-profit contemporary [[art center]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].

==Mission==
Objectif Exhibitions receives structural support from the Flemish Community, with which it supports international contemporary artists by producing exhibitions, events, and publications of and related to their work, and by providing production budgets and stipends directly to those artists. The [[art center]] reaches its local and international publics in person, through printed matter, and on the Internet. The current programme consists of simultaneous and overlapping solo exhibitions, which are presented at differing physical and temporal scales, and with correspondingly different mediation, as well as events, off-site projects, and publications.&lt;ref name="rupert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rupert.lt/en/upcoming/chris-fitzpatrick-2012/|title=Rupert &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Chris Fitzpatrick: &amp;#8220;2012&amp;#8243;|publisher=rupert.lt|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director is given autonomy over the programme by the board of directors, and a new director is hired every four years.&lt;ref name="thewordmagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewordmagazine.com/culture/belgiums-20-best-spaces-for-emerging-art/|title=20 of the best spaces for emerging art in Belgium today - The Word Magazine|publisher=thewordmagazine.com|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Objectif Exhibitions (originally typeset as "objectif_exhibitions")&lt;ref name="objectif-exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectif-exhibitions.org/1999-2007|title=objectif_exhibitions|publisher=objectif-exhibitions.org|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1999 by [[Philippe Pirotte]], Win Van den Abbeele, and Patrick Van Rossem. [[Pirotte]] served as its first director from 1999 to 2004. When [[Pirotte]] became director of [[Kunsthalle Bern]], Van den Abbeele became the second director of Objectif Exhibitions. In 2007, Mai Abu ElDahab became the new director, and shifted the programmatic focus to one-person exhibitions, as well as publications and events. Chris Fitzpatrick is the current director, and was hired in 2012.&lt;ref name="bamart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bamart.be/en/news/detail/7220/0/0/34/|title=Chris Fitzpatrick appointed new artistic director of Objectif-Exhibitions &amp;#124; Flanders Arts Institute|publisher=bamart.be|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectif Exhibitions is currently located at Kleine Markt 7-9, and was moved to its current space in 2007 by ElDahab. [[Willem Elsschot]] once lived in the residence above, and the ground floor and basement facilities inspired Elsschot's classic novel "Kaas (Cheese)." Objectif Exhibitions was formerly located at Coquilhatstraat 14.

{{for|the Poincaré group (fundamental group) of a topological space|Fundamental group}}
{{Group theory sidebar |Topological}}

The '''Poincaré group''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]] (1906),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Poincaré, Henri |date=&lt;!--1905–6--&gt; |title=[[s:fr:Sur la dynamique de l’électron (juillet)|Sur la dynamique de l’électron]] |journal=Rendiconti del Circolo matematico di Palermo |volume=21 |pages=129–176 |doi=10.1007/bf03013466}} ([[Wikisource]] translation: [[s:On the Dynamics of the Electron (July)|On the Dynamics of the Electron]]). The group defined in this paper would now be described as the homogeneous Lorentz group with scalar multipliers. &lt;/ref&gt; was first defined by Minkowski (1908) as the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1907–8--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern]] |journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse |pages=53–111}} (Wikisource translation: [[s:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1908–9--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Raum und Zeit (Minkowski)|Raum und Zeit]] |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=10 |pages=75–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ten-dimensional [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[Lie group]] of fundamental importance in [[physics]].

== Overview ==
A [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometry]] has the property that the interval between [[event (relativity)|event]]s is left invariant. For example, if everything was postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything was shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the [[proper length]] of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.

In Minkowski space (i.e. ignoring the effects of [[gravity]]), there are ten degrees of freedom of the [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]], which may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a "[[Lorentz transformation|boost]]" in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operator of the Poincaré group, with proper rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.

In [[classical physics]], the [[Galilean group]] is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on [[absolute time and space]]. Instead of boosts, it features [[shear mapping]]s to relate co-moving frames of reference.

== Poincaré symmetry ==
'''Poincaré symmetry''' is the full symmetry of [[special relativity]]. It includes:
* ''[[Translation (physics)|translation]]s'' (displacements) in time and space ('''''P'''''), forming the [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] of translations on space-time;
* ''[[rotation]]s'' in space, forming the non-Abelian Lie group of [[three-dimensional rotation]]s ('''''J''''');
* ''[[Lorentz transformation|boosts]]'', transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies ('''''K''''').

The last two symmetries, '''''J''''' and '''''K''''', together make the [[Lorentz group]] (see also [[Lorentz invariance]]); the [[semi-direct product]] of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess '''Poincaré invariance''' or '''relativistic invariance'''.

== Poincaré group ==
The Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]]. It is a ten-dimensional [[Compact space|noncompact]] [[Lie group]]. The [[abelian group]] of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s is a [[normal subgroup]], while the [[Lorentz group]] is also a subgroup, the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the [[affine group]] which includes all translations and [[Lorentz transformation]]s. More precisely, it is a [[semidirect product]] of the translations and the Lorentz group, 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,3) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
with group multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mVovDwAAQBAJ|title=BMS Particles in Three Dimensions|last=Oblak|first=Blagoje|date=2017-08-01|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319618784|location=|pages=80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a [[group extension]] of the [[Lorentz group]] by a vector [[Group representation|representation]] of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the '''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'''. In turn, it can also be obtained as a [[group contraction]] of the de Sitter group SO(4,1) ~ Sp(2,2), as the [[de Sitter space|de Sitter radius]] goes to infinity.

Its positive energy unitary irreducible [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] are indexed by [[mass]] (nonnegative number) and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ([[integer]] or half integer) and are associated with particles in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]).

In accordance with the [[Erlangen program]], the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a [[homogeneous space]] for the group.

In [[quantum field theory]], the universal cover of the Poincaré group
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{SL}(2,C) &lt;/math&gt;
and the double cover
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{Spin}(1,3) &lt;/math&gt;
are more important, because representations of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SO}(1,3)&lt;/math&gt; are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2, i.e. [[fermions]].  Here &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SL}(2,C)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of complex  &lt;math&gt;(2 \times 2) &lt;/math&gt; matrices with unit determinant.

==Poincaré algebra==
{{Lie groups |Other}}
The '''Poincaré algebra''' is the [[Lie algebra]] of the Poincaré group. It is a [[Lie algebra extension#By semidirect sum|Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (det''Λ''=1), [[Lorentz group#Connected components|orthochronous]] ({{math|''Λ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;≥1}}) part of the Lorentz subgroup (its [[identity component]]), SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1, 3),  is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the [[Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)|exponentiation]]  {{math|exp(''ia&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'') exp(''iω&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;''/2)}} of this [[Lie algebra]].  In component form, the Poincaré algebra is given by the commutation relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Principles of Quantum Field Theory |author=N.N. Bogolubov| publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |isbn=0-7923-0540-X |year=1989 |page=272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VLMj4AvvicC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-13950-4320 |author=T. Ohlsson |title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Equation box 1
 |indent=: |cellpadding=6 |border |border colour=#0073CF |bgcolor=#F9FFF7
 | equation = &lt;math&gt;~[P_\mu, P_\nu] = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;~\frac{ 1 }{ i }~[M_{\mu\nu}, P_\rho] = \eta_{\mu\rho} P_\nu - \eta_{\nu\rho} P_\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;~\frac{ 1 }{ i }~[M_{\mu\nu}, M_{\rho\sigma}] = \eta_{\mu\rho} M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\mu\sigma} M_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\nu\rho} M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\nu\sigma} M_{\mu\rho}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
where {{mvar|P}} is the [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|generator]] of translations, {{mvar|M}} is the generator of Lorentz transformations, and {{mvar|η }} is the (+,−,−,−) Minkowski metric (see [[Sign convention]]).

The bottom commutation relation is the ("homogeneous") Lorentz group, consisting of rotations, {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ϵ&lt;sub&gt;imn&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;''/2}}, and boosts, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''M&lt;sub&gt;i0&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,P_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} P_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_i,P_0] =  0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_k] = i \eta_{ik} P_0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_0] = -i P_i ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,J_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,K_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} K_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_m,K_n] = -i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a "Wigner rotation".  Note the important simplification {{math|[''J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;+i K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ,  J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−i K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} 0}},  which permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to '''su(2)'''⊕'''su(2)''' and efficient treatment of its associated [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representations]].

The [[Casimir invariant]]s of this algebra are {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.
 
The Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any [[relativistic field theory]]. As a result, all [[elementary particle]]s fall in [[Wigner's classification|representations of this group]]. These are usually specified by the ''four-momentum'' squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic [[quantum number]]s {{math|''J&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, where {{mvar|J}} is the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] quantum number, {{mvar|P}} is the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and {{mvar|C}} is the [[Charge conjugation|charge-conjugation]] quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]]; where this occurs, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|C}} are forfeited. Since [[CPT symmetry]] is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in quantum field theory, a [[T-parity|time-reversal quantum number]] may be constructed from those given.

As a [[topological space]], the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.

== Other dimensions ==
The definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The d-dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IO}(1,d-1) := \mathbf{R}^{1,d-1} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,d-1) &lt;/math&gt;

with the analogous multiplication

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Lie algebra retains its form, with indices {{mvar|µ}} and {{mvar|ν}} now taking values between {{math|0}} and {{math|d-1}}. The alternative representation in terms of {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has no analogue in higher dimensions.

==Super-Poincaré algebra==
A related observation is that the [[representations of the Lorentz group]] include a pair of inequivalent two-dimensional complex spinor representations &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; whose [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;2\otimes\overline{2}=3\oplus1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjoint representation]]. One may identify this last bit with four-dimensional Minkowski space itself (as opposed to identifying it with a spin-1 particle, as would normally be done for a pair of [[fermion]]s, e.g. a [[pion]] being composed of a [[quark]]-anti-quark pair). This strongly suggests that it might be possible to extend the Poincaré algebra to also include spinors. This leads directly to the notion of the [[super-Poincaré algebra]]. The mathematical appeal of this idea is that one is working with the [[fundamental representation]]s, instead of the adjoint representations.  The physical appeal of this idea is that the fundamental representations correspond to [[fermion]]s, which are seen in nature. So far, however, the implied [[supersymmetry]] here, of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic directions, cannot be seen experimentally in nature.  The experimental issue can roughly be stated as the question: if we live in the adjoint representation (Minkowski spacetime), then where is the fundamental representation hiding?

In two-dimensional works of art, such as [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[photography]] or [[bas-relief]], '''repoussoir''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəpuswaʁ|lang}}, ''pushing back'') is an object along the right or left foreground that directs the viewer's eye into the composition by bracketing ([[Framing (visual arts)|framing]]) the edge. It became popular with [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] artists, and is found frequently in Dutch seventeenth-century landscape paintings. [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], for example, often included a tree along one side to enclose the scene (see illustration). Figures are also commonly employed as ''repoussoir'' devices by artists such as [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Impressionist]]s such as [[Gustave Caillebotte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The revolution of history painting|first=Edgar|last=Wind|p=117|journal=Journal of the Warburg Institute|jstor=750085|volume=2|issue=2|date=October 1938|doi=10.2307/750085|quote=He fulfils the function of a 'repoussoir',and by leading the imagination into a distant land,effectively offsets the shock of seeing the hero die in a modern uniform.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

The '''''Spirit of Haida Gwaii''''' is a sculpture by [[British Columbia]] [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Bill Reid]] (1920–1998). There are two versions of it: the black canoe and the jade canoe. The black canoe features on [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|Canadian $20 bill]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billreidfoundation.org/banknote/spirit.htm&lt;/ref&gt; issued between 2004 and 2012.

==Background==

The sculpture was originally created in 1986 as a {{frac|1|6}}-scale clay model, enlarged in 1988, to full-size clay. In 1991, the model was cast in bronze.  This first bronze casting was entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe''''' and is now displayed outside the [[Canadian Embassy in Washington|Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C.]]  The second bronze casting, entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe''''', was first displayed at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in 1994. Finally, in 1996, the ''Jade Canoe'' (as it is generally called) was moved to the International Terminal at [[Vancouver International Airport]].

The original  plaster pattern for the sculpture is on display in the main hall of the Canadian Museum of History.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/grand/gh04eng.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986–1991, Bill Reid'' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a sculpture ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¢ stamps are perforated 12.5&amp;nbsp;mm × 13&amp;nbsp;mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130101051500/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=12&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP Canada Post stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

An image of the sculpture is featured prominently on the reverse of the 2004 edition of the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill]]. These bills are no longer issued; a new design entered use in 2012.

[[File:Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Jade Canoe, port side.jpg|thumb|Port side of the ''Jade Canoe'']]
''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' is intended to represent the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage of [[Haida Gwaii]], formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands.  In green-coloured bronze on the Vancouver version and black-coloured on the Washington version, it shows a traditional Haida cedar [[dugout canoe]] which totals six metres in length. The canoe carries the following passengers:  [[Raven]], the traditional [[trickster]] of [[Haida mythology]], holding the steering oar; [[Mouse]] Woman, crouched under Raven's tail; [[Grizzly Bear]], sitting at the bow and staring toward Raven; Bear Mother, Grizzly's human wife; their cubs, Good Bear (ears pointed forward) and Bad Bear (ears pointed back); [[Beaver]], Raven's uncle; [[Squaliformes|Dogfish]] Woman; [[Eagle]]; [[Frog]]; [[Wolf]], claws imbedded in Beaver's back and teeth in Eagle's wing; a small human paddler in Haida garb known as the Ancient Reluctant Conscript; and, at the sculpture's focal point, the human [[Shaman]] (or {{lang|hai|Kilstlaai}} in [[Haida language|Haida]]), who wears the Haida cloak and woven spruce root hat and holds a tall staff carved with images of Seabear, Raven, and [[Killer Whale]].
Consistent with Haida tradition, the significance of the passengers is highly symbolic.  The variety and interdependence of the canoe's occupants represents the natural environment on which the ancient Haida relied for their very survival: the passengers are diverse, and not always in harmony, yet they must depend on one another to live. The fact that the cunning trickster, Raven, holds the steering oar is likely symbolic of nature's unpredictability.
The sculpture is {{convert|6|m}} long, not quite {{convert|4|m}} from the base to the top of the Shaman's staff, and weighs nearly {{convert|5000|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/offices-bureaux/haida.aspx?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spring Symphony''' is [[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[opus number|Opus]] 44. It is dedicated to [[Serge Koussevitzky]] and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. It was premiered in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, on Thursday 14 July 1949 (not 9 July which is quoted by many sources) as part of the [[Holland Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten/timelineLaunch.html |title=Britten timeline |publisher=brittenpears.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the composer was 35. At the premiere the tenor soloist was [[Peter Pears]], the soprano Jo Vincent and the contralto [[Kathleen Ferrier]]. The conductor was [[Eduard van Beinum]]. A recording of the performance survives and was first issued by Decca in August 1994.

In October 1950, Spring Symphony was performed at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Triennial Musical Festival]] with a choir of 100 boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Souvenir Programme:  1950 - Leeds Triennial Musical Festival|url=http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1950-Kathleen-Ferrier-Arrau-Beecham-Baillie-De-Vito-Britten-Pears-Barbirolli-/161752247283?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&amp;hash=item25a92f6bf3|publisher=(LTMF Committee)  - City of Leeds UK 1950|accessdate=22 September 2015|quote=6 October 1950 -  to be conducted by the composer  (B.

The Spring Symphony is a [[choral symphony]], written for [[soprano]], [[alto]] and [[tenor]] [[Solo (music)|solo]]ists, mixed [[choir|chorus]], boys' choir (often performed by a children's choir instead) and [[orchestra]]. Britten sets several poets' words, chiefly from the 16th and 17th century such as [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Clare]] and [[George Peele]]. A notable exception is 'Out on the lawn I lie in bed' by his friend [[W. H. Auden]].

In the composer's own words, the work represents 'the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means'.

== Structure ==
The Spring Symphony is made up of four parts, which correspond to the movements of a conventional symphony: ''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]'' with slow introduction, slow movement, ''[[scherzo]]'', and [[Finale (music)|finale]]. Part I begins with the dark and mysterious ''Shine Out'', a poem to the sun. Several more songs follow, including ''The Driving Boy'', which is a piece that features the boys' choir, at times whistling, and [[tambourine]]. The second part has several solos and quiet choruses and references to the month of May. The third part looks forward to May and then to summer. The Finale, ''London, to Thee I do Present'', comes to a climax when the entire chorus joins in a wordless, full-throated [[waltz]] representing the May revellers fortified by [[wine]] and [[ale]] (borne out by some rather unexpected [[modulation (music)|modulation]]s). The climax of the movement is the moment when the children’s voices, accompanied by [[unison]] [[French horn]]s, re-enter the scene and sing the 13th century [[Round (music)|round]] ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In|Sumer is icumen in]]''. The simple tune, sung in 2/4 time over the unyielding 3/4 waltz of the rest of the ensemble, finally achieves dominance. Eventually the celebrations subside, and the [[King of the May|Maylord]] then offers a final blessing with the proclamation: "And so, my friends, I cease."&lt;ref name="score"&gt;{{cite book |last=Britten |first=Benjamin |date=1949 |title=Spring Symphony. Op. 44. For soprano, alto and tenor soli, mixed chorus, boys' choir and orchestra. Full score |url=http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Benjamin-Britten-Spring-Symphony-op-44-study-score-Study-Score-Hawkes-Pocket-Score-66/696677 |location=London |publisher=Hawkes &amp; Son |asin=B0000CTOU1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large orchestra includes triple [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], two [[harp]]s, and a large [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section. Each song has its distinctive scoring, ranging from just first and second [[violin]]s accompanying the tenor (''Waters Above!'') to full orchestra in the first and last songs. The last movement adds the call of a cow-horn, specifying a G, C, and F.&lt;ref name="score"/&gt;

[[File:Summer evening at Skagen - P.S. Krøyer - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]]: ''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore'', 1892]] 

'''''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagen. Kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten}}) is an 1892 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]], one of the best known of the artistic community known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. The work shows Marie Krøyer, the artist's wife, standing on the beach at [[Skagen]] with their dog Rap at her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own family life, gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), who was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there permanently after marrying [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in [[Hornbæk]] on the north coast of [[Zealand]] and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light, particularly in his beach scenes, and painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S. Krøyer|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Marie Krøyer née Triepcke came from a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach. The summers Krøyer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting [[Keats]]' "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Beauty is truth, truth beauty]]".&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"&gt;Svanholm, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result of the periods of mental illness Krøyer experienced from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married the Swedish composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] who had also been taken by her beauty. It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/546/|title=Marie Krøyer (1867&amp;ndash;1940)|author=Lise Svanholm|work=Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=3784&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Marie Krøyer|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The work is oil on canvas and it measures {{convert|206|x|123|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="sm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/ps-kroeyer/sum/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Summer evening at Skagen &amp;ndash; 1892|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Krøyer is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under the light of the setting sun.&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"/&gt; The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called "[[Blue hour|l'heure bleue]]" (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Although Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, the horizon rises above her head, so her radiance is emphasized by comparison with the muted, nearly monochrome background.&lt;ref name="harmony1"&gt;Annette Johansen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was exhibited in 1893 in ''[[Den Frie Udstilling]]'' (The Free Exhibition). Reviews were mixed; [[Carl Hartmann (sculptor)|Carl Hartmann]] writing in the conservative ''[[Nationaltidende]]'' thought the painting beautiful and stated that it was "so fine that it ... throws an ennobling light on the whole collection",&lt;ref name="harmony2"&gt;Mette Bøgh Jensen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p.67&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Johannes Jørgensen]] in ''[[Politiken]]'' claimed that the viewer quickly tired of the picture as the figure of Marie was "incapable of awakening any mood", the colour was in places "distinctly unpleasant" and the dog, Rap, was "an ugly and unpleasant animal to behold".&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
Critics at the [[Salon du Champ-de-Mars]] in 1894 were generally enthusiastic over Krøyer's use of colour and were struck and intrigued by the flatness of the composition.&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
French critics who saw the picture at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume]] in Paris in 1928 compared it to the [[Impressionist]] works of [[Paul-Albert Besnard]], in particular his portrait of Madame Roger Jourdain, though at least one opined that the comparison showed the "victorious influence" of the French school.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt;

==Provenance==
After the exhibition at ''Den Frie Udstilling'' in 1893, it was exhibited at a Munich exhibition in the summer of the same year, and then sold to a German art lover directly from the exhibition. Krøyer had mixed feelings about the sale as he would have preferred to have kept the portrait for a Danish museum, but was pleased that his painting had drawn so much appreciation at the German exhibition that he had not only had enthusiastic reviews but was able to sell it for 1000 kroner more than he would have been able to achieve in Denmark. Although Krøyer no longer owned the painting he was still allowed to exhibit it at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1894. In 1900, he received a letter from the original German purchaser, a banker called Steinbart, informing him that he would like to offer it for sale; Krøyer talked to [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]] who arranged for [[J.C. Jacobsen]] to acquire it for the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in early 1902.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt; In 1937 it was lodged at [[Skagens Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisVaerk.do?vaerkId=263431|title=Sommeraften ved Skagen, kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten|trans-title=Summer Evening at Skagen, the Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=8 September 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}The '''surprise factor''' is a technique used in [[storytelling]] to produce a [[visceral]] reaction from the audience.  It is created by telling a story in a way which creates a certain perception of events which is then revealed to be false often in exact opposition to original perception.  The term most often refers to its use in many forms of [[humour]] which provides the audience with the [[wiktionary:twist#English|twist]] or [[punch line]], intended to elicit [[amusement]].  However it can also be used to elicit a [[tragic]] reaction, rather than a comic one. 

It has been theorised that the essence of humour lies in two elements or factors, the ''relevance factor'', and the ''[[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] factor''.  First, it is necessary to present something familiar or relevant to the audience.  This accounts for gaining the involvement and scrutiny of the audience, who may believe they know the natural follow-through thoughts or conclusion.  Next, the actual [[amusement]] results from the presentation of some twist on what the audience expected, or else from interpreting the original situation in an unexpected way.  These twists and unexpected interpretations may be summarized as the surprise factor.

For this reason, knowing a [[punch line]] in advance, or some situation which would flub the delivery of the punchline, can destroy the surprise factor, and in turn destroy the entertainment value or [[amusement]] the joke may have otherwise provided; such information is known in some contexts as a [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]].  On the other hand, a person previously holding the same unexpected conclusions or secret perspectives as the [[comedian]] could derive amusement from hearing those same thoughts expressed and elaborated.  That there is commonality, unity of thought, and an ability to openly analyze and express these (where secrecy and inhibited exploration was previously thought necessary) can be the surprise factor in these situations.  This phenomenon explains much of the success of comedians who deal with same-gender and same-culture audiences on gender conflicts and cultural topics, respectively.

The '''Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;5''', '''''Washington Mosaics''''', [[Opus number|Op]].&amp;nbsp;57, is an orchestral composition by the Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]], who wrote the piece from 1984–85, revising the finale in 1987. The [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the commissioning institution, premiered the work in 10&amp;nbsp;October 1985 at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], under the direction of its music director, [[Mstislav Rostropovich]].

== Reception ==
=== Notable performances ===
[[File:Kennedy Center - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], at which the NSO premiered Sallinen's Fifth Symphony]]

The Fifth Symphony had its world premiere on 10&amp;nbsp;October 1985, with Mstislav Rostropovich conducting the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) at the Kennedy Center; also on the program was [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius's]] tone poem, ''[[En saga]]'', and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]].{{sfnp|Tuck|1985|p=|ps=none}} ''The Washington Post'' reviewed the work with ambivalence, calling it a "big, ambitious new symphony" with "genuinely moving moments" that nonetheless was "more intriguing than convincing," its "disjointed brilliance" unable "to resolve emotionally".{{sfnp|Tuck|1985|p=|ps=none}} Three days later, Rostropovich and the NSO played the Fifth Symphony at [[Avery Fisher Hall]] in New York,{{sfnp|Rockwell|1985|p=|ps=none}} along with [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich's]] [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth Symphony]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|Cello Concerto in C&amp;nbsp;major]] (Rostropovich serving as soloist).{{sfnp|McLellan|1985|p=|ps=none}} On 23&amp;nbsp;September 1988, Rostropovich and the NSO performed the revised version of the Fifth, again at the Kennedy Center in Washington; also on the program was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] serenade for strings, ''[[Eine Kleine Nachtmusik]]'', and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg's]] two ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)| Peer Gynt Suites]]''.{{sfnp|McLellan|1988|p=|ps=none}}

The British premiere took place on 15&amp;nbsp;February 1987, with [[Okko Kamu]] conducting the [[London Philharmonic]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]]; also on the program was [[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]] ''[[St. Cecilia Mass]]''.{{sfnp|Griffiths|1987|p=|ps=none}} The performance of Sallinen's Fifth, which commenced London's three-month multi-venue, multi-orchestra 'Spotlight on Finland' music festival, was received positively, with ''The Financial Times'' characterizing the work as consisting of "icy fragments of symphonic material [that] have been chipped off to clink and tinkle in Sallinen's structural cocktail shaker".{{sfnp|Loppert|1987|p=|ps=none}} While noting the Fifth Symphony's "allusions to other music" (in particular its "post-Sibelian desolation"), ''The Sunday Times'' applauded the "vitality of Sallinen's rhythms and the sheer eventfulness of his scoring," as well as his "imaginative and masterly ... handling of the large orchestra".{{sfnp|Cairns|1987|p=|ps=none}}  

=== Recordings ===
To date, Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;5 has received three recordings, the first of which is from 1987 with Okko Kamu conducting the Helsinki Philharmonic on the [[Warner Classics|Finlandia]] label. Finnish conductor [[:fi:Ari Rasilainen|Ari Rasilainen]] has also recorded the symphony as part of [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo's]] compendium of Sallinen's orchestral works. The Fifth Symphony joins the [[Symphony No. 3 (Sallinen)|Third]] (Op.&amp;nbsp;35, 1975) on the penultimate volume of the cpo series. In his review of this CD (cpo&amp;nbsp;999970-2), ''[[Fanfare Magazine|Fanfare's]]'' Phillip Scott applauds Rasilainen for "performances of sensitivity and clarity, aided by a stunning recording", albeit played with less obvious irony than [[James DePriest|DePriest's]] effort with the [[Malmö Symphony Orchestra]]. Calling the Fifth and the Third "the pinnacle of Sallinen's orchestral work", he concludes: "Anyone curious about the symphony in contemporary music should own this [cpo] disc".{{sfnp|Scott|2009|p=227–29|ps=none}} Writing for the ''[[American Record Guide]]'', Paul Cook describes Rasilainen's interpretation of Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;5 (relative to his handling of the Third) "much more adroit and he gets it exactly right ... Despite my quibbles [on the Third], this is an excellent release and I think the Fifth deserves your attention".{{sfnp|Cook|2008|p= 166|ps=none}}

'''''The Book of Other People''''' is a collection of [[short stories]], published in 2008 by [[Penguin Books]]. Selected and edited by [[Zadie Smith]], it contains 23 short stories by 23 different authors, among them [[Nick Hornby]], [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], [[Colm Tóibín]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], [[Dave Eggers]], as well as Smith herself. The collection, as evidenced by the title, focuses on character; the authors were simply asked to "make somebody up".&lt;!--I didn't know how to use a template to cite an editor and a preface.--&gt;&lt;ref name="tboop"&gt;[[Zadie Smith|Smith, Zadie]]. Preface. ''The Book of Other People''. By Zadie Smith, ed. [[New York City]]: [[Penguin Books]], 2008. vii–ix. “''The Book of Other People'' is about character. The instruction was simple: ''make somebody up''.”&lt;/ref&gt; It being a "charity anthology," the contributors to ''The Book of Other People'' were not compensated for their writing, and the book's proceeds were given to [[826NYC]], a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students with their creative writing skills.&lt;ref name="the-guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,2208906,00.html |title= The joy of brief encounters |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author= |date=11 November 2007 |work= [[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Alex | last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
One of the central requirements for the authors was that each contribution had to bear the character's name as its title.&lt;ref name="tboop"/&gt; Though the editor, Smith, originally wanted each of the characters to have both [[given name|first]] and [[surname|last names]], several of the authors did not include surnames, and that rule was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name="the-guardian"/&gt; Indeed, several of the stories—such as "Puppy," "The Liar," and "The Monster"—do not have true names at all.

==Critical reception==
''The Book of Other People'' was generally well received by critics, who praised the authors' characterization; one wrote, "[they] create satisfying characters as memorable as any in their novels,"&lt;ref name="usa-today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2008-01-23-other-people-smith_N.htm |title= Imagination takes over 'The Book of Other People |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=David Daley |date=24 January 2008 |work= [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another that "[v]ariety&amp;nbsp;... is certainly on display."&lt;ref name="wash-post"/&gt;

Several of the stories were specifically commended, among them Danticat's "Lélé" and Tóibín's "Donal Webster", which were said to "unfold, like elaborate origami flowers, into complex portraits."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/books/08kaku.html |title= One by One, Narratives Reflecting Life’s Mosaic |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=Michiko Kakutani |date=8 January 2008 |work= [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all were received well—one reviewer wrote that "[o]ther tales in this volume feel overly pat or mechanically perfunctory," and another that "a few of the contributions are bright but empty."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times-online"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article2871427.ece |title= The Book of Other People edited by Zadie Smith |accessdate=2008-04-16 |author=Sophie Harrison |date=18 November 2007| work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fall of Phaeton''''' is a painting  by the Flemish master [[Peter Paul Rubens]], featuring the ancient Greek myth of [[Phaethon|Phaeton]] (Phaethon), a recurring theme in visual arts. Rubens chose to depict the myth at the height of its action, with the thunderbolts hurled by [[Zeus]] to the right. The thunderbolts provide the [[light contrast]] to facilitate the display of horror on the faces of Phaeton, the horses and other figures while preserving the darkness of the event. The butterfly winged female figures represent the hours and seasons, who react in terror as the night and day cycle becomes disrupted. The great [[astrological]] circle that arches the heavens is also disrupted. The assemblage of bodies form a diagonal oval in the center, separating dark and light sides of the canvas. The bodies are arranged so as to assist the viewer’s travel continually around that oval. 

Rubens painted ''The Fall of Phaeton'' in [[Rome]] and the painting was probably reworked later around 1606/1608.&lt;ref name="nga"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.71349.html| title =The Fall of Phaeton|publisher = [[National Gallery of Art]]| accessdate =6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] since 5 January 1990.&lt;ref name="nga"/&gt; Rubens also painted other Greek mythological subjects, such as ''The Fall of Icarus'', ''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda (Rubens)|Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]'', and ''[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgement of Paris]]''.

'''''The South Bank Show''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] arts magazine show. It was originally produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 1978 and 2010. A new version of the series began on [[Sky Arts]] from 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-02/sherlock-and-twenty-twelve-up-for-south-bank-awards|title=Sherlock and Twenty Twelve up for South Bank Awards|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived, written and presented by former [[BBC]] arts broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]], the show aims to bring both [[high art]] and [[popular culture]] to a mass audience.

==History==
===ITV (1978-2010)===
The programme was a replacement for ''[[Aquarius (UK TV series)|Aquarius]]'', the arts series which had been running since 1970. Presenter [[Melvyn Bragg]] was already well known for his arts broadcasting on BBC television, notably ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' and [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Lively Arts''. It first aired on 14 January 1978, covering many subjects,  including  [[Germaine Greer]], [[Gerald Scarfe]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. It is the longest continuously running arts programme on UK television. From the beginning the series' intent was to mix high art and popular culture. This has remained, and the programme has always focused predominantly on art of the 20th and 21st centuries.

For much of its life, the show was produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the ITV network.

In May 2009, ITV announced that the show was to come to an end. Although it was originally reported that the show was ending due to Bragg's retirement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/06/itv-the-south-bank-show-melvyn-bragg "ITV to axe The South Bank Show when Melvyn Bragg retires next year"], ''The Guardian'' (London), 6 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg later made it clear that he decided to leave after they ended the show, and thought ending it was a mistake; according to him, "they've killed the show, so I thought, I'll go as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://living.scotsman.com/books/Interview-Melvyn-Bragg--Man.5640953.jp | title=Interview: Melvyn Bragg - Man out of time |date= 9 November 2009 | work=[[The Scotsman]] | author=Chitra Ramaswamy | accessdate=9 November 2009| quote='It did [shock me] a bit, especially from [ITV chairman] [[Michael Grade|Michael [Grade]]],' says Bragg before steeling himself.

Hodder, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4447-0552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 28 December 2009 the final edition of ''The South Bank Show'' was broadcast featuring [[The Royal Shakespeare Company]] as its subject. Melvyn Bragg announced on this programme, after the final South Bank Show Awards in January 2010, there would be a series of ten ''South Bank Show Revisited'' programmes transmitted in early 2010 featuring updates on previous ''South Bank Show'' subjects.

===Sky Arts (2012-present)===
At the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awards show in January 2010, Lord Melvyn Bragg said he was baffled by ITV's decision to axe ''The South Bank Show'' after 30 years on air. Also at the awards show, [[Prince Charles]] said in a taped testimonial that it was the end of one of the most important beacons of arts in this country which this country was lucky enough to enjoy.

In July 2010, it was revealed that Bragg had bought the rights to the brand and had first right of access to ''The South Bank Show'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/19/south-bank-show-sky-arts | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Maggie | last=Brown | title=Lord Bragg takes South Bank Show to Sky Arts | date=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky Arts]] broadcasts ''South Bank Show'' archive editions and hosted the [[South Bank Sky Arts Award]]s on 25 Jan 2011, presented by Melvyn Bragg, accompanied by a new arrangement of ''The South Bank Show'' theme.

[[Sky Arts]] revived ''The South Bank Show'' with a new series starting 27 May 2012.&lt;ref name="rt revival"/&gt;

==Theme music and visuals==
[[File:Hands of God and Adam.jpg|thumb|250px|The iconic image of the Hand of God giving life to Adam, used since the series' inception.]] 
The [[theme music]] is taken from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'' composed in 1977 for his brother, the cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]]. This is based on the theme from [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]'s "[[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice]]". The brand image of the programme is an animated version of a detail from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] painting, specifically the image of the Hand of God giving life to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. It shows the two hands meeting, generating a [[lightning]] bolt.

== Podcast ==
From 18 September 2006, ITV have begun releasing a [[podcast]] of the interviews from the show, including extra material not included in the broadcast editions. There are plans to release past interviews as part of the podcast as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title       = ''The South Bank Show'' Podcast RSS |publisher   = [[itv.com]] |date        =  |url         = http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |accessdate  = 21 May 2013 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127143608/http://download.itv.com/southbankshow/podcast.xml |archivedate = 27 January 2010 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The programme has been awarded  more than 110 awards (including 12 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]], 5 [[Prix Italia]] and 4 [[Royal Television Society|RTS Award]]s). Pat Gavin's animated [[title sequence]]s have won two BAFTAs.

==Parodies==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The comedy series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' often parodied ''The South Bank Show''. It does this in a series of sketches called ''South Bank'', a cross between ''The South Bank Show'' and the American cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', set in the [[South Bank]] of London. In these sketches, Melvyn Bragg is [[Stan Marsh]], [[Alan Yentob]] is [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Mark Lawson]] is [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] is [[Kenny McCormick]].

A sketch in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'' featured [[Vic Reeves]] as Melvyn Bragg (with felt-tip marks on his face) presenting a feature on fictional folk singers Mulligan and O'Hare. Reeves depicts Bragg as an unlikely ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]'' obsessive.

[[Harry Enfield]]'s TV film ''[[Norbert Smith - a Life]]'' is a parody edition of ''The South Bank Show''.

[[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s second series of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' featured a reference to a fictional episode of ''The South Bank Show'' focused on madcap children's television presenters [[Dick and Dom]].

''[[Private Eye]]'' tends to parody Melvyn Bragg's name, and ''[[Spitting Image]]'' would rather accentuate his nasal accent.

[[Benny Hill]] once parodied Bragg in a 1978 episode of ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' as Melvyn Dragg. The name of the show was also parodied, and it was called "The South Blank Show."

[[File:On ne passe pas-1915.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|Halte la! On ne passe pas !}}&lt;br/&gt;French card, 1915]]
[[File:On Ne Passe Pas 1918.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|On ne passe pas !}}&lt;br/&gt;Propaganda poster by {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Neumont|fr}}]]
"'''They shall not pass'''" ({{lang-fr|On ne passe pas !}}; {{lang-es|¡No pasarán!}}; {{lang-ro|Pe aici nu se trece!}}) is a [[slogan]] used to express determination to defend a position against an enemy. "{{lang|fr|On ne passe pas}}" literally means "one does not pass"; this being a common French idiom to express interdiction.

It was most famously used during the [[Battle of Verdun]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] by [[French Army|French]] General [[Robert Nivelle]]. It appears on propaganda posters, such as that by Maurice Neumont after the [[Second Battle of the Marne]], which was later adopted on uniform badges by units manning the [[Maginot Line]]. Later during the war, it also was used by [[Romanians|Romanian]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Mărășești]] (the Romanian translation of the phrase is "{{lang|ro|Pe aici nu se trece}}", literally meaning "One does not pass through here").

It was also used during the [[Spanish Civil War]], this time at the [[Siege of Madrid]] by [[Dolores Ibárruri|Dolores Ibárruri Gómez]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Spain]], in her famous "{{lang|es|No pasarán}}" speech on 18 July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{https://books.google.it/books?id=j983FGkF1jEC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=no+pasaran+july+Ib%C3%A1rruri+radio&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQjfimuLLdAhUk_CoKHcmBAc8Q6AEITDAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The leader of the fascist forces, [[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]] [[Francisco Franco]], upon gaining [[Madrid]], responded to this slogan by declaring "{{lang|es|Hemos pasado}}" ("We have passed").

"{{lang|es|¡No pasarán!}}" was used by British anti-fascists during the October 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]], and is still used in this context in some political circles. It was often accompanied by the words {{lang|es|nosotros pasaremos}} (we will pass) to indicate that communists rather than fascists will be the ones to seize [[power (social and political)|state power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Audrey Gillan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/30/thefarright.past |title=Day the East End said ''No pasaran'' to Blackshirts |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-10-02 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was brought to the public consciousness again following action in December 1943 by [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] officer [[Paul Triquet]] of the [[Royal 22nd Regiment|Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Regiment]]; his action included his use of Nivelle's phrase "to win a key objective at [[Ortona]], Italy, in the face of overwhelming German opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French Canadian Wins Victoria Cross |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=March 6, 1944 |accessdate=September 15, 2014 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19440304&amp;id=lvouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ENwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4474,785365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the phrase {{lang|es|¡No pasarán!}} was a theme in the [[Central American crisis|civil wars in Central America]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|particularly in Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunzle |first=David |title=The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979–1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSDgTC6JXI0C&amp;pg=PA168 |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520081925 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|es|Nicaragua no pasarán}} is also the title of a 1984 documentary by [[David Bradbury (film maker)|David Bradbury]] about the events in Nicaragua that led to the overthrow of Somoza's dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart A. |title=The Aftermath of the Sandinista Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUX22oowNIAC&amp;pg=PA152 |year=2009 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=9780822590910 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlinefilms.com.au/videos/nicaragua.htm |title=Nicaragua: ''No Pasaran'' |publisher=Frontline Films |accessdate=30 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=FitzSimons |first1=Trish |last2=Laughren |first2=Pat |last3=Williamson |first3=Dugald |title=Australian Documentary: History, Practices and Genres |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1_p2BdHjLUC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521167994 |page=267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During France's counteroffensive against the living dead, a team of commandos moving through a tunnel breaks through a wall to find three hundred zombies on the other side. The last words heard from the squad's leader: ''"On ne passe pas!"''

[[File:Free Tibet - 4 tibetan script styles.jpg|left|thumb|Four different Tibetan script styles traditionally and commonly used by Tibetans]]
'''Tibetan calligraphy''' refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions used to write the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].  As in other parts of East Asia, nobles, high lamas, and persons of high rank were expected to have high abilities in calligraphy.  However, unlike calligraphy in [[Chinese calligraphy|China]], [[Japanese calligraphy|Japan]], and Korea, calligraphy was done using a reed pen as opposed to a brush.  Nevertheless, East Asian influence is apparent visually, as Tibetan calligraphy is at times more free-flowing than calligraphy involving the descendants of other [[Brahmic family|Brahmi]] scripts. Given the overriding religious nature of [[Tibetan culture]], many of the traditions in calligraphy come from religious texts, and most Tibetan scribes have a monastic background.&lt;ref&gt;https://tashimannox.com/index.php/tibetan-calligraphy/about-the-artist&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
A variety of different styles of calligraphy existed in Tibet:

* The '''[[Uchen script|Uchen]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་ཅན།}}, "headed"; also transliterated as ''uchan'' or ''dbu-can'') style of the [[Tibetan script]] is marked by heavy horizontal lines and tapering vertical lines, and is the most common script for writing in the Tibetan language, and also appears in printed form because of its exceptional clarity.  When handwritten, it is the most basic form of calligraphy, and must be mastered before moving onto other styles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kimsch.net/Tibetan%20Calligraphy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** Ngatar ({{bo-textonly|སྔ་དར།}}) development
*** Toad - the initial Thonmi Sambhota edition
** Qitar ({{bo-textonly|ཕྱི་དར།}}) development
*** '''Sarqung''' or '''chung''' (standard ujain; {{bo-textonly|གསར་ཆུང༌།}})
*** '''Sugring'''
*** '''Sugtung'''
*** '''Sarqên'''
* The '''[[Umê script|umê]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་མེད།|ume=1}}, "headless"; or ''ume'') style is a more cursive script which can be seen in daily correspondence and in other day-to-day life.  The feature which distinguishes it the most from ''u-chan'' is the lack of the horizontal lines on the top of letters.
* The '''bêcug''' ({{bo-textonly|དཔེ་ཚུགས།}}; or ''betsu'') style is a narrow, cursive variant of ''umê'' in squarish shape.
* The ''zhuza'' ({{bo-textonly|འབྲུ་ཚ།}}; or ''drutsa'') style is a variant of ''umê'' but with ''ujain'' vowel symbol.
** curve-leg zhuza
** straight-leg zhuza
** short-leg zhuza
* The ''cugtung'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་ཐུང༌།}}; or ''tsugtung'') style is shortened, abbreviated variant of ''u-me'', traditionally used for commentaries.
* The ''cugrin'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་རིན།}}) style
* The ''kyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|འཁྱུག་ཡིག།}}, "fast letters"; or ''chuyig'') is a highly abbreviated, fluid, cursive version of ''u-me''.  It is a common form of handwriting for notes and personal letters.
** general cursive
** extremely cursive
* The ''cug-ma-kyug'' yig style - a style halfway between ''cug'yig'' and ''kyug'yig''
* The ''gyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|རྒྱུག་ཡིག།}}) style

==Other related styles==
The vertical [[Phagspa script|Phags-pa]] script is known as ''horyig'' ({{bo-textonly|ཧོར་ཡིག་}} ''hor-yig'', "Mongolian letters").  A more ornamental version of the ''horyig'' style was used in the past to make personal seals. It is often found written vertically as opposed to horizontally.

These styles are not fixed, and are not limited to those listed above. By mixing features of various styles, and adding various ornaments to the text, the number of styles becomes quite large. While ''ujain'' may be used to write entire [[Sutra]]s or Buddhist texts, the rest of the styles are more frequently used to write a single phrase or saying.

A '''turnaround''' or '''turnaround deal''' is an arrangement in the [[film industry]] whereby the production costs of a project which one [[film studio|studio]] has developed are declared a loss on the company's tax return, thereby preventing the studio from exploiting the property any further. The rights can then be sold to another studio in exchange for the cost of development plus interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Murky Side of Movie Rights |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-23 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/media/24steal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Cieply defined the term in ''The New York Times'' as "arrangements under which producers can move a project from one studio to another under certain conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio War Involving ‘Watchmen’ Heats Up |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-29 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/movies/30watc.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19318">[[File:Pieter Bruegel der Ältere - Landschaft mit der Flucht nach Ägypten.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'', 1563, 37.1 × 55.6 cm (14.6 × 21.9 in)]]

The '''world landscape''', a translation of the German '''''Weltlandschaft''''', is a type of composition in Western painting showing an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  The subject of each painting is usually a Biblical or historical narrative, but the figures comprising this narrative element are dwarfed by their surroundings.

The world landscape first appeared in painting in the work of the [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Joachim Patinir]] (c. 1480–1524), most of whose few surviving paintings are of this type, usually showing religious subjects, but commissioned by secular patrons. "They were imaginary compilations of the most appealing and spectacular aspects of European geography, assembled for the delight of the wealthy armchair traveler",&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ann Sutherland, ''Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture'', 378, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1856694151}}, 9781856694155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA378 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; giving "an idealized composite of the world taken in at a single Olympian glance".&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositional type was taken up by a number of other Netherlandish artists, most famously [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. There was a parallel development by Patinir's contemporary [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and other artists of the [[Danube school]].  Although compositions of this broad type continued to be common until the 18th century and beyond, the term is usually only used to describe works from the [[Low Countries]] and Germany produced in the 16th century.  The German term ''Weltlandschaft'' was first used by Eberhard Freiherr von Bodenhausen in 1905 with reference to [[Gerard David]],&lt;ref&gt;In his monograph on Gerard David and his School (Munich, F. Bruckmann), Weemans, 263&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1918 applied to Patinir's work by [[Ludwig von Baldass]], defined as the depiction of "all that which seemed beautiful to the eye; the sea and the earth, mountains and plains, forests and fields, the castle and the hut".&lt;ref&gt;Weemans, 263, quoting von Baldass&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patinir rocks (Bayard, Chandelle).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Rocks at [[Dinant]] and in a Patinir detail]]

The treatment of landscape backgrounds in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] was greatly admired in Italy, and Flemish specialists were employed in some Italian workshops, including that of [[Titian]].  The backgrounds to many of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s early prints were appropriated by a number of Italian artists. Patinir, "emboldened by the Italian taste for Northern rusticity, began as early as the 1510s to expand the backgrounds of his paintings out of all proportion" in a way that "violently reversed the ordinary hierarchy of subject and setting".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 42–45, 43 and 45 quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1520 he was well known for these subjects, and when Dürer visited him in [[Antwerp]] he described him in his diary as "the good painter of landscapes" (''gut landschaftsmaler'') in the first use of ''Landschaft'' in an artistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 138; Wood, 45 (dating the visit to 1521)&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as "portable panel paintings were almost always vertical in format before 1520" and "Patinir's landscapes were among the first small horizontal panels of any sort".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 47, quoted&lt;/ref&gt; He typically uses three base colours to articulate his compositions, with a brownish foreground, a blue-green middle zone, and blues in the distance.  The horizon-line is relatively high on the picture plane.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 139; Jenson, 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Patinir (and [[Herri met de Bles]]) came from [[Dinant]] on the [[Meuse]] (in modern [[Belgium]]) where, in "a startlingly un-Netherlandish landscape", there are dramatic rock cliffs and free-standing crags along the river. These are frequently recalled in his paintings, and came to form a common feature of works by other artists.  [[Image:Crossing the River Styx.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx]]'', [[Joachim Patinir]], c. 1515–1524, Prado]]
With other vertical features, these are painted as though seen straight on even when in the lower parts of the landscape, and thus "reassert the integrity of the picture plane" in his works, against the sprawling horizontal impetus of the main landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Harbison, 139, quoted ("reassert"); Silver, 30; Schama, 416–417, 416 quoted ("startlingly un-Netherlandish")&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[Simon Schama]] see these as "the last survivors of the landscape of symbols", relating them to medieval and even earlier "corkscrew" representations of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 25–27, 27 quoted; Schama, 415–417&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is related to the landscape backgrounds of [[Hieronymous Bosch]], although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not as concerned to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his ''[[St. Jerome at Prayer (Bosch)|St. Jerome at Prayer]]'' anticipate the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 27&lt;/ref&gt; In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a [[long shot]] rather than a [[medium shot]].

Most art historians regard the figure subject as continuing to be important in the works of Patinir and his followers, rather than mere [[staffage]] for a landscape, and most are of subjects where a wide landscape had relevance.  Among the most popular were the [[Flight to Egypt]], and the Netherlandish 15th-century innovation of the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', and subjects showing hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] with the world from which they had withdrawn laid out beneath them.  As well as connecting the style to the [[Age of Discovery]], the role of [[Antwerp]] as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Cornelis massys-huida egipto-prado.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'', [[Cornelis Massys]], c. 1540]]

The style is also an early example of the 16th-century artistic trend to "Mannerist inversion" (the term devised by [[Max Dvořák]]) or the "inverted composition", where previously minor or background elements come to dominate the picture space. In the 1550s [[Pieter Aertsen]] began a style of large canvasses dominated by great spreads of food [[still life]] and large [[genre art|genre figures]] of cooks or market-sellers, while in the background small biblical scenes can be glimpsed. Some paintings by [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] place genre figures in the foreground of paintings on religious or moral subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 152–153; Falkenberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century all these subject areas became established as independent genres in Dutch and Flemish painting, and later throughout Western painting.

Patinir's invention was developed by [[Herri met de Bles]] (1510 – c.1555–1560), who was probably his nephew. He took the type into the new style of [[Northern Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 432, 441–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists were [[Lucas Gassel]], the [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], and [[Cornelis Massys]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 35–39; Baldwin, 362&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De val van Icarus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original]]

Massys was the son of [[Quentin Massys]], a friend of Patinir, who had added the figures to at least one Patinir landscape, the ''Temptation of St Anthony'' ([[Prado]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 45; Snyder, 409&lt;/ref&gt; and who had used the style in some of his own works, such as a ''Madonna and Child'' (1513) in [[Poznań]]. Patinir increasingly left the larger figures in his works to other masters, and also seems to have had a large workshop or circle of followers in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Silver, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was adopted and made more natural in the landscapes of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], who had travelled to Italy via the Alps.  Back in Antwerp he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.  Some of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563, illustrated at top), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, but already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] and not part of the supposed narrative subject.

Other works explored variations on the theme, with his famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons being the culmination of his style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 39–52; Snyder, 502–510; Harbison, 140–142; Schama, 431–433&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruegel was also aware of the Danube landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275–278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danube school==
[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer, The Battle of Alexander at Issus.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]], ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', 1529, 158.4 cm × 120.3 cm (62.4 in × 47.4 in)]]

The [[Danube school]] was a contemporary group of German and [[Austria]]n artists who were also pioneers of landscape painting, and the first to regularly paint pure landscapes without figures.  Their landscapes revel in the forests of the Upper Danube, and the place of a foreground figure is often taken by a single tree, a formula invented by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], the most significant artist of the group, and used, mostly in drawings and prints, by [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. Other innovative works showed close-up views of dense forest with hardly any distant view or even sky.  But many of their landscapes are panoramic in a version of the Netherlandish style, although the river winding out of sight normally replaces the sea that occupies the horizon of many Netherlandish works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, throughout, especially 160–168; Snyder, 357–359, 362–364; Harbison, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;  It is probable that at least Altdorfer had seen a Patinir by about 1531; one was in [[Augsburg]] from 1517 (an ''Assumption'' now in [[Philadelphia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Altdorfer's painted landscapes are usually vertical,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 49&lt;/ref&gt; and, if only because it was commissioned for a vertical space, this is the case for the most extreme of all large world landscapes, his ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1529, Munich). This extraordinary painting shows a view right across the [[Mediterranean]], with a mass of tiny figures fighting a great battle in the foreground. They are in modern [[Turkey]], and the view extends beyond the island of [[Cyprus]] to the coast of [[Egypt]] and the [[Sinai peninsula]] and the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 22–23, 201–202, 266–267; Snyder, 362–363; Harbison,&lt;/ref&gt; The painting originally formed one part of a set of historical paintings in the same format.

==Influence on later landscape painting==
Both the Netherlandish and Danubian approaches to landscape painting were greatly influential for later artists.&lt;ref&gt;On Danubian influence: Wood, 165–171, 234–235, 267–275&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Flemish artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Anton Mirou]], [[Lucas van Valkenborch]] and [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] continued to produce late Mannerist versions of the full formula, as developed by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, before in the 1590s van Coninxloo let the trees move in like curtains from the sides to restrict and then eliminate a distant view, pioneering the Flemish development of the dense forest views of the Danube school.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 175–176, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]] had studied in the 1590s with his relative [[Tobias Verhaecht]], an especially conservative artist who continued to use world landscape styles derived from Pieter Bruegel the Elder until the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Rubens]] rapidly outgrew his influence, in some of his later landscapes, such as the ''Summer, Peasants going to Market'' (c. 1618, [[Royal Collection]]), "the tradition of the old 'world landscape' plainly lives on".&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 189–192, 191 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peasants going to market PP Rubens.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Summer, Peasants going to Market'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], c. 1618]]

Aspects of the particular formula of the world landscape, though no longer usually described by that term, continue to reappear in different versions until the 19th century.  In [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] the idiosyncratic paintings and prints of [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589 – c. 1638), as rare as Patinirs, were great panoramic views, very often with mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688) used the panoramic elevated view, and often included water, but showed vistas of flat farmland or town roofs with a low horizon.

The Italian [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]], part of the [[School of Fontainebleau]], introduced the Flemish world landscape into French art in works such as the ''[[Orpheus]] and [[Euridice]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] and the ''Rape of [[Proserpina|Prosperine]]'' in [[the Louvre]], both large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700'', p. 61, 2nd edn 1957, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;  In French Baroque or classical painting many artists including both [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted "Landscape with ..." subjects, and for Claude wide panoramic views with mixed elements of mountains, water and small figures formed the bulk of his work, although both the viewpoint and horizon are generally much lower than in 16th-century works. Claude in turn became enormously influential, and until the early 19th century his style continued to have the advantage of giving a painting of a "landscape with" a higher place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and consequently a higher price, than a mere pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Romanticism]] this changed, but panoramic views continued to be painted in the 19th century, and artists such as those in the [[Hudson River School]], [[Edward Lear]] and Russian landscape painters took the compositional style to new landscapes around the world in works such as ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859, [[Frederic Edwin Church]]), though often excluding all people and buildings. These still featured in the huge apocalyptic religious paintings of the English painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], which are often literally "end of the world landscapes", taking the history of the genre back to its origins with Bosch.

{{Quantum field theory}}
'''Yang–Mills theory''' is a [[gauge theory]] based on the [[Special unitary group|SU(''N'') group]], or more generally any [[Compact Lie algebra|compact]], [[reductive Lie algebra]]. Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these [[non-abelian group|non-abelian Lie groups]] and is at the core of the unification of the [[electromagnetic force]] and [[weak force]]s (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as [[quantum chromodynamics]], the theory of the [[strong force]] (based on SU(3)). Thus it forms the basis of our understanding of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.

In a private correspondence, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] formulated in 1953 a six-dimensional theory of [[Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]], extending the five-dimensional theory of [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza, Klein]], [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and others to a higher-dimensional internal space.&lt;ref name = Straumann&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Straumann |first=N |year=2000 |title=On Pauli's invention of non-abelian Kaluza-Klein Theory in 1953 |eprint=gr-qc/0012054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Pauli developed the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a [[gauge field]] or the quantization of it. Because Pauli found that his theory "leads to some rather unphysical shadow particles", he refrained from publishing his results formally.&lt;ref name=Straumann /&gt; Although Pauli did not publish his six-dimensional theory, he gave two talks about it in Zürich.&lt;ref&gt;See Abraham Pais' account of this period as well as L. Susskind's "Superstrings, Physics World on the first non-abelian gauge theory" where Susskind wrote that Yang–Mills was "rediscovered" only because Pauli had chosen not to publish.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research shows that an extended Kaluza–Klein theory is in general not equivalent to Yang–Mills theory, as the former contains additional terms.&lt;ref name=Reifler&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Reifler|first=N |year=2007 |title=Conditions for exact equivalence of Kaluza-Klein and Yang–Mills theories |eprint=0707.3790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]]&lt;ref name=YM&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=Chen-Ning Yang |first1=C. N. |last1=Yang |authorlink2=Robert Mills (physicist) |first2=R. |last2=Mills |title=Conservation of Isotopic Spin and Isotopic Gauge Invariance |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=191–195 |year=1954 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.96.191|bibcode = 1954PhRv...96..191Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; extended the concept of [[gauge theory]] for [[abelian group]]s, e.g. [[quantum electrodynamics]], to [[nonabelian group]]s to provide an explanation for strong interactions. The idea by Yang–Mills was criticized by Pauli,&lt;ref&gt;[http://universe-review.ca/R15-21-YangPauli.htm An Anecdote by C. N. Yang]&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[quantum|quanta]] of the Yang–Mills field must be massless in order to maintain [[gauge invariance]]. The idea was set aside until 1960, when the concept of particles acquiring mass through [[symmetry breaking]] in massless theories was put forward, initially by [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], [[Yoichiro Nambu]], and [[Giovanni Jona-Lasinio]].

This prompted a significant restart of Yang–Mills theory studies that proved successful in the formulation of both [[electroweak interaction|electroweak unification]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). The electroweak interaction is described by SU(2) × U(1) group while QCD is an [[SU(3)]] Yang–Mills theory. The electroweak theory is obtained by combining [[SU(2)]] with [[U(1)]], where quantum electrodynamics (QED) is described by a U(1) group, and is replaced in the unified electroweak theory by a U(1) group representing a weak hypercharge rather than electric charge. The massless bosons from the SU(2) × U(1) theory mix after [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] to produce the 3 massive weak bosons, and the [[photon]] field. The [[Standard Model]] combines the [[strong interaction]] with the unified electroweak interaction (unifying the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]]) through the symmetry group SU(2) × U(1) × SU(3). In the current epoch the strong interaction is not unified with the electroweak interaction, but from the observed [[Running coupling|running of the coupling]] constants it is believed {{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=January 2016}} they all converge to a single value at very high energies.

[[Phenomenology (particle physics)|Phenomenology]] at lower energies in quantum chromodynamics is not completely understood due to the difficulties of managing such a theory with a strong coupling. This may be the reason why [[color confinement|confinement]] has not been theoretically proven, though it is a consistent experimental observation. Proof that QCD confines at low energy is a mathematical problem of great relevance, and an award has been proposed by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] for whoever is also able to show that the Yang–Mills theory has a [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap|mass gap and its existence]].

== Mathematical overview ==
Yang–Mills theories are a special example of [[gauge theory]] with a [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] symmetry group given by the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gf} = -\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Tr}(F^2)=- \frac{1}{4}F^{a\mu \nu} F_{\mu \nu}^a &lt;/math&gt;

with the generators of the [[Lie algebra]], indexed by {{mvar|a}}, corresponding to the ''F''-quantities (the [[curvature]] or field-strength form) satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(T^aT^b)=\frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab},\quad [T^a,T^b]=if^{abc}T^c,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;''abc''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are [[structure constant]]s of the Lie algebra, and the [[covariant derivative]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt;D_\mu=I\partial_\mu-igT^aA^a_\mu &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|I}} is the [[identity matrix]] (matching the size of the generators), &lt;math&gt;A^a_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Four-vector|vector]] potential, and ''g'' is the [[coupling constant]]. In four dimensions, the coupling constant ''g'' is a pure number and for a SU(''N'') group one has &lt;math&gt;a,b,c=1\ldots N^2-1.&lt;/math&gt;

The relation

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu \nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a-\partial_\nu A_\mu^a+gf^{abc}A_\mu^bA_\nu^c &lt;/math&gt;

can be derived by the [[commutator]]

:&lt;math&gt;[D_\mu, D_\nu] = -igT^aF_{\mu\nu}^a.&lt;/math&gt;

The field has the property of being self-interacting and equations of motion that one obtains are said to be semilinear, as nonlinearities are both with and without derivatives. This means that one can manage this theory only by [[perturbation theory]], with small nonlinearities.

Note that the transition between "upper" ("contravariant") and "lower" ("covariant") vector or tensor components is trivial for ''a'' indices (e.g. &lt;math&gt;f^{abc}=f_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;), whereas for μ and ν it is nontrivial, corresponding e.g. to the usual Lorentz signature, &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu \nu }={\rm diag}(+---)&lt;/math&gt;.

From the given Lagrangian one can derive the equations of motion given by

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu F_{\mu\nu}^a+gf^{abc}A^{\mu b}F_{\mu\nu}^c=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}=T^aF^a_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, these can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;(D^\mu F_{\mu\nu})^a=0.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Bianchi identity]] holds

:&lt;math&gt;(D_\mu F_{\nu \kappa})^a+(D_\kappa F_{\mu \nu})^a+(D_\nu F_{\kappa \mu})^a=0&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the [[Jacobi identity]]

:&lt;math&gt;[D_{\mu}, [D_{\nu},D_{\kappa}]]+[D_{\kappa},[D_{\mu},D_{\nu}]]+[D_{\nu},[D_{\kappa},D_{\mu}]]=0&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;[D_{\mu},F^a_{\nu\kappa}]=D_{\mu}F^a_{\nu\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;. Define the [[Hodge star operator|dual]] strength tensor
&lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\rho\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, then the Bianchi identity can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mu}\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

A source &lt;math&gt;J_\mu^a&lt;/math&gt; enters into the equations of motion as

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu F_{\mu\nu}^a+gf^{abc}A^{b\mu}F_{\mu\nu}^c=-J_\nu^a.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the currents must properly change under gauge group transformations.

We give here some comments about the physical dimensions of the coupling. In ''D'' dimensions, the field scales as &lt;math&gt;[A]=[L^\frac{2-D}{2}]&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} and so the coupling must scale as &lt;math&gt;[g^2]=[L^{D-4}]&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that Yang–Mills theory is not [[renormalization|renormalizable]] for dimensions greater than four. Furthermore, for ''D'' = 4, the coupling is dimensionless and both the field and the square of the coupling have the same dimensions of the field and the coupling of a massless quartic [[scalar field theory]]. So, these theories share the [[scale invariance]] at the classical level.

== Quantization ==
A method of quantizing the Yang–Mills theory is by functional methods, i.e. [[Path integral formulation|path integrals]]. One introduces a generating functional for ''n''-point functions as

:&lt;math&gt;Z[j]=\int [dA]\exp\left[- \frac{i}{2} \int d^4x\operatorname{Tr}(F^{\mu \nu} F_{\mu \nu})+i\int d^4x \, j^a_\mu(x)A^{a\mu}(x)\right] ,&lt;/math&gt;

but this integral has no meaning as it is because the potential vector can be arbitrarily chosen due to the [[gauge freedom]]. This problem was already known for [[quantum electrodynamics]] but here becomes more severe due to [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] properties of the gauge group. A way out has been given by [[Ludvig Faddeev]] and [[Victor Popov]] with the introduction of a '''ghost field''' (see [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]) that has the property of being unphysical since, although it agrees with [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], it is a complex scalar field, which violates the [[spin–statistics theorem]]. So, we can write the generating functional as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
Z[j,\bar\varepsilon,\varepsilon] &amp; = \int [dA] [d\bar c] [dc] \exp\left\{iS_F[\partial A,A]+iS_{gf}[\partial A]+iS_g[\partial c,\partial\bar c,c,\bar c,A]\right\} \\
&amp;\exp\left\{i\int d^4x j^a_\mu(x)A^{a\mu}(x)+i\int d^4x[\bar c^a(x)\varepsilon^a(x)+\bar\varepsilon^a(x) c^a(x)]\right\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

being

:&lt;math&gt;S_F=- \frac{1}{2} \int  \operatorname{d}\!^4 x \operatorname{Tr}(F^{\mu \nu} F_{\mu \nu})&lt;/math&gt;

for the field,

:&lt;math&gt;S_{gf}=-\frac{1}{2\xi} \int  \operatorname{d}\!^4 x (\partial\cdot A)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for the gauge fixing and

:&lt;math&gt;S_g=-\int  \operatorname{d}\!^4 x  (\bar c^a\partial_\mu\partial^\mu c^a+g\bar c^a f^{abc}\partial_\mu A^{b\mu}c^c)&lt;/math&gt;

for the ghost. This is the expression commonly used to derive Feynman's rules (see [[Feynman diagram]]). Here we have ''c&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' for the ghost field while ξ fixes the gauge's choice for the quantization. Feynman's rules obtained from this functional are the following

&lt;center&gt;[[File:FeynRulesEN.jpg|488px]]&lt;/center&gt;

These rules for Feynman diagrams can be obtained when the generating functional given above is rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
Z[j,\bar\varepsilon,\varepsilon] &amp;= \exp\left(-ig\int d^4x \, \frac{\delta}{i\delta\bar\varepsilon^a(x)} f^{abc}\partial_\mu\frac{i\delta}{\delta j^b_\mu(x)} \frac{i\delta}{\delta\varepsilon^c(x)}\right)\\
&amp; \qquad \times \exp\left(-ig\int d^4xf^{abc}\partial_\mu\frac{i\delta}{\delta j^a_\nu(x)}\frac{i\delta}{\delta j^b_\mu(x)}\frac{i\delta}{\delta j^{c\nu}(x)}\right)\\
&amp; \qquad \qquad \times \exp\left(-i\frac{g^2}{4}\int d^4xf^{abc}f^{ars}\frac{i\delta}{\delta j^b_\mu(x)} \frac{i\delta}{\delta j^c_\nu(x)} \frac{i\delta}{\delta j^{r\mu}(x)} \frac{i\delta}{\delta j^{s\nu}(x)}\right) \\
&amp; \qquad \qquad \qquad \times Z_0[j,\bar\varepsilon,\varepsilon]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0[j,\bar\varepsilon,\varepsilon]=\exp\left(-\int d^4xd^4y\bar\varepsilon^a(x)C^{ab}(x-y)\varepsilon^b(y)\right)\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\int d^4xd^4yj^a_\mu(x)D^{ab\mu\nu}(x-y)j^b_\nu(y)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

being the generating functional of the free theory. Expanding in ''g'' and computing the [[functional derivative]]s, we are able to obtain all the ''n''-point functions with perturbation theory. Using [[LSZ reduction formula]] we get from the ''n''-point functions the corresponding process amplitudes, [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] and [[decay rate]]s. The theory is [[renormalization|renormalizable]] and corrections are finite at any order of perturbation theory.

For quantum electrodynamics the ghost field decouples because the gauge group is abelian. This can be seen from the coupling between the gauge field and the ghost field that is &lt;math&gt;\bar c^a f^{abc}\partial_\mu A^{b\mu}c^c&lt;/math&gt;. For the abelian case, all the structure constants &lt;math&gt;f^{abc}&lt;/math&gt; are zero and so there is no coupling. In the non-abelian case, the ghost field appears as a useful way to rewrite the quantum field theory without physical consequences on the observables of the theory such as cross sections or decay rates.

One of the most important results obtained for Yang–Mills theory is [[asymptotic freedom]]. This result can be obtained by assuming that the [[coupling constant]] ''g'' is small (so small nonlinearities), as for high energies, and applying [[perturbation theory]]. The relevance of this result is due to the fact that a Yang–Mills theory that describes strong interaction and asymptotic freedom permits proper treatment of experimental results coming from [[deep inelastic scattering]].

To obtain the behavior of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified [[a posteriori]] in the [[Ultraviolet divergence|ultraviolet limit]]. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see [[hadrons]]). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to try to solve it on computers (see [[lattice gauge theory]]). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the [[glueball]] and [[exotic meson|hybrids]] spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states. Indeed, the σ resonance&lt;ref name=ccl&gt;{{cite journal |first=I. |last=Caprini |first2=G. |last2=Colangelo |first3=H. |last3=Leutwyler |year=2006 |title=Mass and width of the lowest resonance in QCD |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=96 |issue=13 |page=132001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.132001 |bibcode=2006PhRvL..96m2001C |arxiv = hep-ph/0512364 |pmid=16711979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ygp&gt;{{cite journal |first=F.

This is a hotly debated issue.

== Open problems ==
Yang–Mills theories met with general acceptance in the physics community after [[Gerard 't Hooft]], in 1972, worked out their [[renormalization]], relying on a formulation of the problem worked out by his advisor [[Martinus Veltman]]. (Their work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = 't Hooft | first1 = G. | last2 = Veltman | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(72)90279-9 | title = Regularization and renormalization of gauge fields | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 44 | pages = 189 | year = 1972 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1972NuPhB..44..189T }}&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized by the 1999 [[Nobel prize]] in physics.) Renormalizability is obtained even if the gauge bosons described by this theory are massive, as in the electroweak theory, provided the mass is only an "acquired" one, generated by the [[Higgs mechanism]].

The mathematics of the Yang–Mills theory is a very active field of research, yielding e.g. invariants of differentiable structures on four-dimensional manifolds via work of [[Simon Donaldson]]. Furthermore, the field of Yang–Mills theories was included in the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]'s list  of "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]". Here the prize-problem consists, especially, in a proof of the conjecture that the lowest excitations of a pure Yang–Mills theory (i.e. without matter fields) have a finite  mass-gap with regard to the vacuum state. Another open problem, connected with this conjecture, is a proof of the [[Color confinement|confinement]] property in the presence of additional Fermion particles.

In physics the survey of Yang–Mills theories does not usually start from perturbation analysis or analytical methods, but more recently from systematic application of numerical methods to [[lattice gauge theory|lattice gauge theories]].
