The decade of the '''2000s in film''' involved many significant developments in the film industries around the world, especially in the technology used. Building on developments in the 1990s, [[computer]]s were used to create effects that would have previously been more expensive, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in ''[[Cast Away]]'' (leaving [[Tom Hanks]]' character stranded with no other land in sight) to the vast battle scenes such as those in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]], ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]].

In addition, [[film genre]]s not known for their popular appeal in North America became increasingly attractive to filmgoers: films in foreign languages like ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''; and [[documentary film]]s like ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Super Size Me]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', became very successful.

The 2000s saw the resurgence of several genres. [[Comic book]] [[superhero film]]s became a mainstream blockbuster genre following the releases of ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. The film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' similarly sparked the revival of [[epic films]], while the [[Bollywood]]-inspired ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' sparked the revival of [[musical film]]s in the [[Western world]], where Bollywood musical films such as ''[[Lagaan]]'' and ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' also began gaining mainstream exposure. The [[battle royal|battle royale]] genre also began with the release of [[Japanese film]] ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]''.

Also gaining popularity was the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) to produce films.  These types of films were originally seen in the [[1990 in film|1990s]] with the likes of ''[[Toy Story]]'', and
''[[Antz]]'', but CGI films became more popular in 2001 with the release of ''[[Shrek]]''.  Other popular CGI films include ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Bee Movie]]'', ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Chicken Little]],'' ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Flushed Away]]'', ''[[Happy Feet]]'', ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'', ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'', ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'', ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'', ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. In addition, ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' became the second animated feature ever to receive an Oscar nomination for The Best Picture.

== Career ==
Merkle completed his degree in [[economics]] in 1948 at the  [[University of Fribourg]] and obtained his Ph.D. in 1950 under the supervision of [[Josef Schwarzfischer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unifr.ch/webnews/content/20/attach/1119.pdf |title=Adolphe Merkle |language=German |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 27 he went into the real estate business and discovered the company [[VibroMeter]] in [[Villars-sur-Glâne]], which developed and fabricated measuring instruments. He became the sole shareholder and CEO of the company, that from the 1960s on manufactured with great succes specialized instruments for the automobile and aviation industries and in 1990 for the [[heavy-lift launch vehicle|heavy-lift rocket]] [[Ariane 5]]. In 1991 Merkle sold the majority of his share to [[Elektrowatt]] and retired from the company's management in 1998 after its sale to [[Meggitt PLC]].&lt;ref name=Liberté&gt;''{{cite web |url=http://www.laliberte.ch/regions/adolphe-merkle-la-mort-d-un-visionnaire |title=Adolphe Merkle: la mort d'un visionnaire |archive-date=2012-02-24 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224034011/http://www.laliberte.ch/regions/adolphe-merkle-la-mort-d-un-visionnaire |language=French |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2007 Merkle made a donation of 100 million [[Swiss Francs]] to the [[University of Fribourg]] for the foundation of a research institute in [[nanotechnology]] and [[material sciences]]. Subsequently, he donated a further 10 million Swiss Francs to turn the former medical clinic Garcia in Fribourg (next to the Perolles campus of the university) into the research facility that is now named after him, the [[Adolphe Merkle Institute]].&lt;ref name=BZ&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hans Ulrich Schaad |url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/freiburg/Ein-Visionaer-ist-gestorben-/story/24204210 |title=Ein Visionär ist gestorben |language=German |journal=[[Berner Zeitung]] |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The by Swiss standards extraordinary donation&lt;ref name=NZZ&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.nzz.ch/gebender_unternehmer-1.15256325 |title=Gebender Unternehmer: Adolphe Merkle gestorben |journal= [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] |access-date= 2018-09-26 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the highest private donation to a university in Switzerland to date.&lt;ref name=SDA&gt;{{cite_web |url=http://www.romandie.com/news/n/Deces_de_l_industriel_et_mecene_fribourgeois_Adolphe_Merkle230220121502.asp |title=Décès de l'industriel et mécène fribourgeois Adolphe Merkle |language=French |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Adolphe-Merkle-Foundation'', which he foundend, is part of the institute council and promotes in many areas the institute's support of multilingualism or scientific awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web |url=http://www.am-institute.ch/about/organization/foundation |title=Adolphe Merkle Foundation |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Merkle was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] by the University of Fribourg and together with his wife [[honorary citizenship]] by the Canton of Fribourg.&lt;ref name=BZ /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19510">A growing number of film festivals are held in the Middle East to showcase films from the region as well as international standouts.&lt;ref&gt;Jaafar, Ali, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008038/ Film festivals bloom in Middle East], ''Variety'', 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, institutions and organizations in other parts of the world are increasingly honoring the new generation of filmmakers in the Middle East with '''Arab film festivals'''.

Though burgeoning Arab filmmakers still struggle with constrained funding and a lack of established distribution channels, artists are beginning to produce more and more commercially viable films.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfbusiness.com/2012/12/waiting-for-the-rise-of-the-arab-film-industry/#.URmGf46hZaE&lt;/ref&gt;  Films featured at festivals both in the Middle East and around the world run the gamut from films about war, identity, political or social issues to romantic comedies and thrillers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/world/middleeast/arab-filmmakers-seek-commercial-success.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Goals of festival organizers are largely to provide an alternative portrayal of Arabs to that in mainstream global media in order to promote understanding and dialogue between the Arab world and the West. In addition, festivals work to support Arab filmmakers in the Middle East and elsewhere by providing a platform for them to screen and promote their cinematic achievements to broad audiences.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia"&gt;http://www.varietyarabia.com/en/print.aspx?sid=c34c335b-5b8e-4636-9166-34ec0b3ca62a&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab film festivals in the Middle East ==

=== Egypt ===

The '''[[Cairo International Film Festival]]''' is a world-class annual film festival in Cairo, Egypt. Established in 1976, it was the first film festival to be held in the Arab world and is the only international competitive feature film festival in the Middle East and Africa recognized by the [[FIAPF]]. The festival has awarded many Egyptian and internationally renowned actors, actresses and directors. Special awards, such as the Best Arab Film Award, are bestowed upon the most exceptional regional films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciff.org.eg/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the '''[[Alexandria International Film Festival]]''', Egypt's second largest film festival, is held every September in local theaters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/egypt/alexandria/review-470391.html&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics (EAFWC), the festival promotes film culture and aims to bolster relations among international filmmakers and the Mediterranean in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulletfilm.com/festival/alexandria-international-film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrating its 10th edition in 2017 is the '''[[Cairo International Women's Film Festival]]'''. From its earliest edition, Entre Cineastas, to the Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films, CIWFF has developed and expanded over the years. The festival aims at introducing films made by female filmmakers from around the world and serving as a meeting point for them and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/188201/Arts--Culture/Film/INTERVIEW-Filmmaker-Amal-Ramsis-on-the-th-Cairo-In.aspx |title=INTERVIEW: Filmmaker Amal Ramsis on the 9th Cairo Int'l Women's Film Festival |website=english.ahram.org.eg |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chosen solely by public vote, one film is presented with the Audience Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/aboutus/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jordan ===

Founded in 2004, the '''[[Jordan Short Film Festival]]''' is managed by the [[Amman Filmmakers Cooperative]], a film collective based in Amman, Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625100608/http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a week-long event, the festival organizers promote independent cinema with screenings throughout the year and have launched two main competitions: the International short film competition and the Arab short film competition. Notably, the festival was suspended in 2011 as an act of protest against the killing of peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring. In a statement, the JSFF founder and director noted that "it would be misleading and dishonest to pretend that Jordan under such circumstances can host film festivals that can openly and freely screen films about human rights and other pressing issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919150719/http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |archivedate=2013-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the '''Karama Human Rights Film Festival''' was conceived and organized by Ma3mal 612 (Think Factory), a collective of avante-garde artists and filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Ma3mal612]&lt;/ref&gt; Karama, which means dignity, promotes cinema that explores human rights issues and opens democratic dialogue about human rights between and among local and international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karamafestival.org/new/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202081048/http://karamafestival.org/new/ |archivedate=2014-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuwait ===
The [http://www.thegreencaravan.com Green Caravan Film Festival], in its 5th year now, is the Middle East's premiere film festival dedicated to the niche market of environmental films. It began in Kuwait in 2009, and from 2010 added Dubai-based screenings to its programming, and plans to add more Gulf cities to its venue locations in the future.

== Arab film festivals abroad ==

A large and growing number of Arab film festivals take place outside of the Middle East. These festivals play a key role in increasing access to and interest in Arab cinema outside of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt; They are also important for Arab diasporas eager to stay in touch with the cultural scene of their homelands.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt;

Established in California in 1996, the [[Arab Film Festival]] is the largest independent annual exhibition of Arab films in the United States. It is regarded as one of the most important Arab film festivals outside of the Arab world. The official mission of the festival is to "enhance public understanding of Arab culture and to provide alternative representations of Arabs that contradict the stereotypical images frequently encountered in the American mass media." The festival shows films from and about the Arab world in order to furnish audiences with realistic images of Arab culture, art, history, people and politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://arabfilmfestival.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[:es:Festival Internacional de Cine Euro-Árabe AMAL|Amal Euroarab Film Festival]]''' was born in 2003 in [[:es:Santiago de Compostela|Santiago de Compostela]], Spain. It is developed by [http://www.fundacionaraguaney.org/ Araguaney-Bridge between Cultures Foundation] and directed by Ghaleb Jaber Martínez. Amal means "hope" in Arab language, the hope that Arab world needs more than ever. [http://www.festivalamal.es/ Amal Festival] seeks to promote the development of co-productions between Galicia and Spain and Arab countries, building cross-cultural bridges.

The '''London Middle East &amp; North Africa Film Festival''', created in 2011, provides an annual platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and reach audiences who might not otherwise get the opportunity to view cinema from the region, stimulating cross-cultural dialogue, connection and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;http://menafilmfest.com/#/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in London, the annual '''London Palestine Film Festival''' was established in 1998, making it the UK's longest-running festival specialising in film from and upon any region of the Arab world. Providing a platform for international as well as Palestinian film, the festival takes place in Spring and is managed by UK-based non-profit the '''Palestine Film Foundation'''. It combines screenings, artists' talks, and panel discussions, with art exhibitions, conferences, and book launches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palestinefilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middle Eastern Film Festival NYC''', produced by Media Space NYC, aims to entertain and enlighten moviegoers with both short and feature-length films about topics related to the Middle East. It is an offshoot and new medium incarnation of the very successful Noor Play Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middleeasternfilmfestivalnyc.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sofia Middle East &amp; North Africa Region Film Festival''' is an annual Arab/Islamic event in the Balkans, presenting films from the Middle East and North Africa to a Bulgarian audience. Since its inception in 2009, the festival has screened more than 120 titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.menarfest.com/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malmö Arab Film Festival]] (MAFF)''', founded in 2011 has rapidly grown to be one of the major yearly manifestations of Arab film outside the Arab World. The founder, Mouhamad Keblawi, is also managing director. Thirteen prices are awarded yearly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malmoarabfilmfestival.se&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a number of Arab film festivals abroad focus specifically on the issue of Palestine. Events such as the '''Boston Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonpalestinefilmfest.org/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Toronto Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://tpff.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Houston Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Chicago Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://palestinefilmfest.com/&lt;/ref&gt; bring Palestinian and Palestine-related cinema, narratives and culture to a dispersed audience.

== LatinAmerica ==

1.1 [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/ LatinArab International Film Festival]

The Latin Arab International Film Festival has been held yearly for the last seven years in the City of Buenos Aires. The only festival of its kind in the American continent, it has grown into a platform where to meet and promote Arab cinema and where to build a bridge and bring together the Latin American and Arab cultures, as they have so much in common. The festival's venues are public theatres Cine.Ar and el cultural San Martín and the Alliance Francaise. 
At the same time, LatinArab's industry Forum (The Latin Arab Co-Production Forum), held within the frame of the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, aims at potentiating both regions' film industries with the conception of films carried out as co-productions. [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/]

== Notable films ==

Arab film festivals sometimes serve as forums for political and cultural statements. In 2003, for instance, Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Hagar presented his controversial ''Girls' Love'', the story of a love affair between an Egyptian man and a Jewish woman.

More recently, films screened and/or competing at the festivals have reflected the Arab Spring. The 2012 Dubai International Film Festival showcased Hinde Boujemaa’s ''It was Better Tomorrow'', in which a homeless woman and her son live hand to mouth, squatting in apartments left empty by fleeing multinationals. Another documentary, ''True Story of Love, Life Death and Sometimes Revolution'' by Nidal Hassan, gathers the views and testimonies of Syrian women during the Syrian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/news/article/15-powerful-muhr-arab-documentaries-explore-womens-lives-and-society-post-a/year/2012{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3910">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1920 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

On 3 February 1944 the [[Bishop of Mazara]], monsignor Salvatore Ballo, gave the permit to build this church, and they start works on 22 January 1945.

Thanks to the priest Bartolomeo Palumbo, it was founded in 1946 on a piece of land given by a lady and built after the plan of Giuseppe Russo, an engineer; it already became a [[parish]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="gui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, the parson, Father Palumbo, founded the male and female Congregation of saint Joseph the Worker;  every year, on the 23rd January, they celebrated the festivity of Saint Joseph’s  Marriage, by taking part to the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], during which the married couples were blessed. 
Later both the congregations joined  the parish Association of [[Azione Cattolica]].&lt;ref name="con"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.190, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 he founded the male and female Congregations of Maria Santissima di Fatima: the scope was that of  solemnizing the month of May and the feast of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] on May 13, moreover they had to take part to the Mass on the first Saturday each month. 
They also joined the Associations of Azione Cattolica later.&lt;ref name="con"/&gt;

Saint Joseph the Worker is celebrated on May 1, in the district of ''San Ciusippuzzu''. Besides religious ceremonies and the [[procession]], there are musical and theatrical shows and bike races.

== Father Palumbo ==
[[File:Funerale_nel_Corso_VI_Aprile,_Alcamo.jpg|thumb|Corteo funebre di Padre Palumbo]]
Father Palumbo was born in Alcamo on 29 August 1915 and became a priest in 1941; he soon had the office of  Vicar Cooperator in the parishes of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Church of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew]], [[Church of the Holy Crucifix (or Saint Francis of Paola)]] and [[Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory (Alcamo)|Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory]]. He was also nominated as honorary [[Canon (priest)]] of the [[collegiate church]] of the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]].

On bare feet,  with a cross on his hands and a great number of believers, on 30 April 1944 he went towards the quarter of ''Balatelle'' (a suburb at that time) on the piece of land which had been donated to him by Mrs. Annunziata Macaluso, the widow of the chemist doctor Fazio,&lt;ref name=Regi&gt;Vincenzo Regina: La chiesa parrocchiale di San Giuseppe in Alcamo; Grafiche Campo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; put down the cross there and, since then, every Sunday he celebrated the Holy Mass on a makeshift altar.&lt;ref name=Papa&gt;Tommaso Papaː Memorie storiche del clero di Alcamo; ediz.Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, Alcamo, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;   

Until he stayed in seminary he was a great devotee of Saint Joseph: during the night he got up, kneeled and recited the [[rosary]] in honour of him, this prayer in dialect, very interesting also from the symbolical point of view:

''Scura stasira agghiorna dumani ''

''la pruvvidenza m’aviti a mannari''.&lt;ref name="sbe"&gt;http://win.lasberla.com/Cultura-trapani/2225-comunicazione-evento--della-traslazione-salma-sac-bartolomeo-palumbo-#.&lt;/ref&gt;

(It was a prayer asking for Providence from the Saint).
He asked for saint Joseph’s protection both for his family and the Church, then he put his project on the Saint’s hands.
In 1947 he succeeded in completing the basement below the Church and start celebrating Mass there.[4]

With his zeal and faith, Father Palumbo succeeded in dragging all the district and citizens to contribute to the costs for completing  the building of the Church by any type of offerings, even in kind  (wheat, eggs, legumes, flour, etc.). He used all these things, however, to help a lot of people in need  too; there are so many stories about his great goodness.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;
He succeeded  also in creating a parish community very united and open to charity.

With the bishop’s bull of May 3, 1947, the Church was elevated to a parish and the following day the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]], His  Excellency Monsignor Ballo, gave  father Palumbo the canonical possession.&lt;ref name=Papa/&gt;    
Father Palumbo's mother, signora Vita Rocca, had donated her dowry for the legal recognition of the Parish, which was given with the Decree of the President of Republic on 10 June 1948.&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt;

On 30 May he died, leaving his parish community and the whole town in anguish for his  untimely end: there were thousands of people at his [[funeral]].

He was buried in the old cemetery ''Cappuccini'' in Alcamo and, after the approval by His Excellency Mons. Alessandro Plotti, on 22 October 2013, by  popular demand of believers, his mortal remains were moved to his Church.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;

== Description and works ==
The façade is elegant and in [[Romanesque style]]; the interior is with one nave and a coffered ceiling.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;

There are these works: :

*Wooden statue of saint Joseph with the [[Infant Jesus]] in his arms made by Giuseppe Di Caro, a sculptor from Palermo, in 1952. The mantle of the saint is covered with pure gold, and their clothes with silver.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;
*An Angel trumpet player and the Angel musician: both chromium-plated by [[Gino Patti]], the [[surrealist painter]] from Alcamo,&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt; on the walls behind the high altar
*Wooden statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], right altar, realized by Giuseppe Stuflesser from [[Ortisei]] ([[Bolzano]]) in 1949
*Statue of [[Christ the King]], left altar, realized by Luigi Santifaller in 1954. Below it there is the [[sarcophagus]] with the mortal remains of the [[Reverend]] Father Palumbo.

In fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.
 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a [[canon (fiction)|set of contiguous events]], sometimes said to be "set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]]."

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Most continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather "loose" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.

Another example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Yet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete’s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song "Brazzle Dazzle Day" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
{{main|Plot hole}}

A plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.

===Homeric Nod===
{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}
A '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].

The [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lines 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''... et idem'' &lt;br /&gt; ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble "nods", as for example:

*In ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Book V Lines 576-579&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later&lt;ref&gt;Book XIII Lines 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 ("the two of them came forward").

In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's "nods" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.

[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern usage====
In his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase "Homer Nods" as the title of a retraction or correction.

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94259-4 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"/&gt; A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

==Deliberate continuity errors==

Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
Television programs like ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired!

Starting as a database of art historians mentioned in major art historiographies, the site has grown through the comments and contributions of various authors specializing in national fields of art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about/explanation-en Explanation on website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations are ordered chronologically  by date of first publication, with first lines often provided to illustrate the style of the translation.

O Muse, sing to me of the man full of
resources, who wandered very much &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
after he had destroyed the sacred city
of Troy, and saw the cities of many 
men, and learned their manners. Many 
griefs also in his mind did he suffer on 
the sea, although seeking to preserve
his own life, and the return of his 
companions; but not even thus, 
although anxious, did he extricate his 
companions : for they perished by 
their own infatuation, fools! who 
devoured the oxen of the Sun who 
journeys on high; but he deprived 
them of their return. O goddess, 
daughter of Jove, relate to us also 
some of these things.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Hero of craft-renown, O Song-goddess, chant me his fame,
Who, when low he had laid Troy town, unto many a far land came,&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;And many a city beheld he, and knew the hearts of their folk, 
And by woes of the sea was unquelled, o'er the rock of his spirit that broke,
When he fain would won for a prey his life, and his friends' return,
Yet never they saw that day, howsoever his heart might yearn, 
But they perished every one, by their own mad deeds did they fall,
For they slaughtered the kine of the Sun, and devoured them&amp;nbsp;— fools were they all. 
So the God in his wrath took awav their day of return for their guilt. 
[(''1903 edition''): So in anger their home-coming day did the God take away for their guilt.]  
O Goddess, inspire my lay, with their tale; take it up as thou wilt.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

When they ate the oxen of Hyperion the Sun,
And that god snuffed out their day of return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Muse, speak to me now of that resourceful man
who wandered far and wide after ravaging&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;the sacred citadel of Troy. He came to see
many people’s cities, where he learned their customs,
while on the sea his spirit suffered many torments,
as he fought to save his life and lead his comrades home.
But though he wanted to, he could not rescue them—
they all died from their own stupidity, the fools.
They feasted on the cattle of Hyperion,
god of the sun—that’s why he snatched away their chance                      
of getting home someday. So now, daughter of Zeus,                                     
tell us his story, starting anywhere you wish.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

many a sea-mile after he ransacked Troy’s holy city.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Many the men whose towns he observed, whose minds he discovered,

Not even so did he save his companions, as much as he wished to,
for by their own mad recklessness they were brought to destruction,
childish fools&amp;ndash;they decided to eat up the cows of the High Lord,
Helios: he then took from the men their day of returning.

after he sacked the holy city of Trojans:&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;tell me all the men’s cities he saw and the men’s minds,

striving for life and a way back home for his war friends.
Yet he saved no friends, much as he longed to:
they lost their lives through their own reckless abandon,
fools who ate the cattle of Helios the Sun-God.
Huperion seized the day they might have arrived home.

Fools--who ate the cows of Helios-Hyperion,
and the day of their return was taken from them.

who was blown off course to the ends of the earth, in the years
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;after he plundered Troy. He passed through the cities
of many people and learned how they thought, and he suffered
many bitter hardships upon the high seas
as he tried to save his own life and bring his companions
back to their home. But however bravely he struggled,
he could not rescue them, fools that they were—their own
recklessness brought disaster upon them all;
they slaughtered and ate the cattle of Hélios,
so the sun god destroyed them and blotted out their homecoming.
Goddess, daughter of Zeus, begin now, wherever

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

'''Gregg Bordowitz''' (born August 14, 1964) is a writer, artist and activist currently working as a professor in the Video, New Media, and Animation department at [[The School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].

==Biography==
Gregg Bordowitz was born August 14, 1964 in [[Brooklyn]], NY. In 1982, Bordowitz began his academic career at the [[School of Visual Arts]], then studied at the [[Whitney Museum]] Independent Study Program from 1985 to 1986, and at [[New York University]] from 1986 to 1987. In 1987, Bordowitz dropped out of school to become a full-time video artist, guerilla TV director and activist with the direct action advocacy group [[ACT UP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/docs/Bordowitz_CV_2012.pdf|title=Gregg Bordowitz's online ''Curriculum vitae''|publisher=Greggbordowitz.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Bordowitz was central to the formation of the notable video activist collective, Testing the Limits, who produced work documenting AIDS activism that were distributed through television, museums, schools and community centers. He also wrote prolifically on the topic of AIDS activism, contributing heavily to the 1987 "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" of the well-respected academic journal [[October (journal)|October]]. In 1988, Gregg Bordowitz tested positive for [[HIV]] and, as a result, came out as a [[homosexual]] man  to his mother and stepfather. He left Testing the Limits (now a self-sufficient non-profit entity) to focus on a more 'guerilla' approach to documenting AIDS activism. In 1988, he met video artist [[Jean Carlomusto]] at a demonstration partnered with her to produce the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) cable TV show ''Living With AIDS'', which ran regularly until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/diva/Archive.html |title=A Report on the Archiving of Film and Video Work by Makers with AIDS |publisher=Actupny.org |date=1986-06-30 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he, along with numerous other video activists, formed [[Like a Prayer (documentary)|DIVA]] (Damned Interfering Video Activists), a partner organization to ACT UP, dedicated to accurately documenting the protests organized by ACT UP and providing an alternative representation of the AIDS activist movement than the one presented by the [[Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS#United States|mainstream media]].

In 1993, filled with despair at the decline of AIDS activism as well as his own diminishing chances of survival, Bordowitz produces one of his most famous pieces, the documentary/montage ''Fast Trip, Long Drop''. In this video, Bordowitz addresses the public's reaction to and representation of the [[AIDS epidemic]] as well as his own fears, insecurities and struggles related to the disease. ''Fast Trip, Long Drop'' provides a pessimistic counterpoint to the flood of representations of people "Surviving and Thriving" with AIDS through a collage of documentary footage, staged parody and vintage film clips. For the first time in an AIDS related documentary, people with AIDS were shown addressing and coming to terms with the ever-present fact of their own mortality. As Bordowitz explains in his 1999 interview with the AIDS art forum Artery, "When I made "Fast Trip, Long Drop" I was tired of pretending for the sake of others that I would survive. I became preoccupied with the burdens that sick people bear on behalf of those around them who are well. I wanted to get a handle on despair and put it out there as a political problem. To be recognized and discussed. If we couldn't do this, then it all seemed like bullshit. I wanted an honest media produced in the interests of people living with AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertatkins.net/beta/witness/artists/moves/bordowitz.html |title=Robert Atkins.Net |publisher=Robert Atkins.Net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, along with many of his other works, has been shown in film festivals, museums and on television ever since with extremely positive response.

From there, Bordowitz continued to address AIDS in his artwork, video work and writing. He taught video art at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], [[Brown University]], and [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] from 1995 to 2010, before being hired as a permanent professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His works have been shown at [[the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[the Whitney Museum of American Art]], and [[the Museum of Modern Art]], as well as numerous film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter |first=Rebecca A. |url=http://www.fnewsmagazine.com/2002-april/aprilregulars5.html |title=Faculty Profile: Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Fnewsmagazine.com |date=2002-07-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A History of Sexuality Volume One by Michel Foucault: An Opera==
In 2009, Gregg Bordowitz began collaboration with artist Paul Chan an opera adaptation of [[Michel Foucault]]’s [[History of Sexuality]]. Though they envisioned the project as an impossible to complete, they were approached by Viennese museum curator Achim Hochdörfer, and asked to stage a performance at the [[MUMOK]]. In 2010, they staged a 6-man performance written and directed by Bordowitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=26517 |title=Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Artforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/projects.html |title=Projects |publisher=Greggbordowitz.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Itinerarium Burdigalense''''' ("Bordeaux Itinerary") — also known as the ''Itinerarium Hierosolymitanum'' ("Jerusalem Itinerary") — is the oldest known Christian ''[[itinerarium]]''. It was written by the "Pilgrim of Bordeaux", an anonymous pilgrim from Burdigala (present-day [[Bordeaux]], France).&lt;ref&gt;The basic edition is that edited by P. Geyer and O. Kuntz, Brepols, 1965; general context of early [[Christian pilgrimage]] is provided by E.D. Hunt, ''Holy Land Pilgrimage in the Late Roman Empire AD 312-460'' 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  It recounts the writer's journey to the [[Holy Land]] in the years 333 and 334&lt;ref&gt;"We travelled in the Consulate of Dalmatius and Zenophilus, leaving Chalcedonia on 30 May and returned to Constantinople on 26 December in the same Consulate." Quoted in Jaś Elsner, "The Itinerarium Burdigalense: Politics and Salvation in the Geography of Constantine's Empire", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''90''' (2000:181-195) p. 183. On the return journey the pilgrim took another route in order to see Rome. The return trip from Milan to Bordeaux is not repeated.&lt;/ref&gt; as he traveled by land through northern [[Italy]] and the [[Danube]] valley to [[Constantinople]], then through [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] to [[Jerusalem]], and then back by way of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Otranto]], [[Rome]], and [[Milan]].  

==Interpretation and analysis==
According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'': {{quote|text=The report of his journey outside [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] is little more than a dry enumeration of the cities through which he passed, and of the places where he stopped or changed horses, with their respective distances. For the Holy Land he also briefly notes the important events which he believes to be connected with the various places. In this he falls into some strange blunders, as when, for instance, he places the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] on [[Mount of Olives|Mount Olivet]]. Such errors, however, are also found in subsequent writers. His description of Jerusalem, though short, contains information of great value for the topography of the city.}}

Another reader, [[Jaś Elsner]], notes that, a brief twenty-one years after [[Constantine I|Constantine]] institutionalized Christianity, "the [[Holy Land]] to which the pilgrim went had to be entirely reinvented in those years, since its main site—ancient Jerusalem—had been sacked under the [[Emperor Hadrian]] and refounded as [[Aelia Capitolina]]." Elsner found to his surprise "how swiftly a Christian author was willing implicitly to re-arrange and redefine deeply entrenched institutional norms, while none the less writing on an entirely traditional model [i.e., the established Greco-Roman genre of [[travel writing]]]."&lt;ref&gt;Elsner 2000:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The compiler of the itinerary was aware at each boundary of crossing from one [[Roman province]] to the next, and distinguished carefully between each change of horses (''mutatio'') and a stopover place (''[[mansio]]''), and the differences between the simplest cluster of habitations (''[[vicus]]'') and the fortress (''[[castellum]]'') or city (''[[civitas]]''). The segments of the journey are summarised; they are delineated by major cities, with major summaries at Rome and Milan, long-established centers of culture and administration, and Constantinople, refounded by Constantine only three years previously, and the "non-city"&lt;ref&gt;"...the non-city of Jerusalem, which until Constantine's accession was nothing but a provincial backwater, its Jewish and Christian sites utterly destroyed in its Hadrianic refounding." (Elsner 2000:189).&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem.  

Glenn Bowman engaged in a close textual analysis of the ''Itinerarium''; he argues that in fact it is a carefully structured work relating profoundly to Old and New Biblical dispensations via the medium of water and baptism imagery.&lt;ref&gt; Bowman, "Mapping History's Redemption: Eschatology and Topography in the Itinerarium Burdigalense' in ''Jerusalem: its Sanctity and Centrality to Judaism, Christianity and Islam''. (ed. Lee. I. Levine). New York &amp; Jerusalem: Continuum Press and Magness Press. 1998. pp. 163-187 ([http://www.kent.ac.uk/anthropology/department/staff/bowman/mapping.pdf on-line text in pdf format] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924090508/http://www.kent.ac.uk/anthropology/department/staff/bowman/mapping.pdf |date=2006-09-24 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Itinerarium'' survives in four manuscripts, all written between the 8th and 10th centuries. Two give only the Judean portion of the trip, which is fullest in topographical glosses on the sites, in a range of landscape detail missing from the other sections, and Christian legend.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner 2000:190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Christophe Heyland''' aka '''Jean-Christophe Kumpfler''' (1791 [[Frankfurt]] – 29 August 1866 [[Genoa]]), was a Swiss engraver, watercolourist, and illustrator, who produced the plates for many botanical works such as the 1825-27 ''Plantes Rares du Jardin de Geneve'' by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIKART|4029000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Geneva from 1803, and produced all illustrations for botanical memoirs published by Geneva botanists after 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Memoires, Volume 5 of "Société de physique et d'histoire naturelle de Genève" - Imprimerie A. L. Vignier, Rue de Rhone, Maison de la Poste, 1832&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrated the work of [[Benjamin Delessert]], [[Philip Barker-Webb]], [[Giuseppe Giacinto Moris]], [[Pierre Edmond Boissier]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiquariaatjunk.com/item.php?item=2152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Baptised Jean-Christophe Kumpfler, he went to Geneva in his youth as an apprentice hairdresser to an uncle named Heyland, whose surname he subsequently adopted. He showed a keen interest in the graphic arts, and employed his leisure time in studying drawing and engraving. After spending a few years in London, where he was a designer of costumes for the theatre, he returned and settled in Geneva.

[[José Mariano Mociño]] and [[Martín de Sessé]] worked on a ''Flora Mexicana'' and after de Sessé's death in 1808, Mociño met de Candolle in  
1816 in [[Montpellier]] and showed him the drawings they had produced for the planned work. De Candolle requested that the plates be copied by artists of the Geneva community.&lt;ref&gt;"Frontier Naturalist - Jean Louis Berlandier and the Exploration of Northern Mexico and Texas" - Russell M. Lawson&lt;/ref&gt; Of these copied plates, the sixteen done by Heyland caught de Candolle's eye. Guided by de Candolle he became one of the leading botanical artists of the period, working for him for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirages.com/pages/books/ST12198/augustin-pyramus-de-candolle/plantes-rares-du-jardin-de-geneve&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was [[Jean-Louis Berlandier]] who also showed great aptitude in his botanical illustrations.

Becoming a citizen of Geneva in 1819, Heyland was admitted to the Society of Arts and the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences. The [[Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria|Archduke Reynier]], Viceroy of Lombardy, commissioned him in 1849 to work at the botanical garden in [[Monza]]. In 1859 he returned to Geneva, where he lived on the proceeds from the lessons he gave in drawing.

From 1835 he worked as principal artist on [[Charles Antoine Lemaire]]'s ''Jardin Fleuriste''. He drew and engraved 5 full-page illustrations, including ''[[Impatiens parviflora]]'' for de Candolle's ''Quatrieme Notice sur Les Plantes Rares''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/jean-louis-prevost/page-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1839 and 1846 he produced the illustrations for volumes 4-5 of [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/535#/details ''Icones selectae plantarum''], another of de Candolle's projects in collaboration with Benjamin Delessert (1773-1847). He carried out several commissions for the Geneva Botanical Garden, and directed the engraving and printing in colour of the 180 plates used for 'Voyage botanique en Espagne'.

In his old age he suffered from trembling hands and failing eyesight, but retained his good humour to the end. His final contribution to botanical art was the 122 plates he produced for Pierre Edmond Boissier's 1866 work, "Icones Euphorbiarum". 
 
Augustin Pyramus de Candolle created the genus ''Heylandia'' in 1825 in his honour, a genus which is now included in ''[[Crotalaria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Crotalaria in Africa and Madagascar" - R. M. Polhill (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyland died on 29 August 1866 at a village near Genoa during a trip in Italy. He had married a girl from Milan and had a son.&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.rero.ch/record/11923/files/gf_584_1_partie2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Boissier &amp; Reuter named an [[iris (plant)|Iris]] after him ''[[Iris heylandiana]]'' in the [[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]] (J. Linn. Soc. Bot.) Vol.16 on page 142.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Pries |date=30 July 2016 |title=(SPEC) Iris heylandiana Boiss. &amp; Reut. |url=http://wiki.irises.org/bin/view/Spec/SpecHeylandiana |publisher=wiki.irises.org |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature''''' ({{lang-de|Mimesis: Dargestellte Wirklichkeit in der abendländischen Literatur}}) is a book of [[literary criticism]] by [[Erich Auerbach]], and his most well known work. Written while Auerbach was teaching in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], where he fled after being ousted from his professorship in Romance [[Philology]] at the [[University of Marburg]] by the [[Nazis]] in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Mimesis'' famously opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the [[Bible]]. From these two seminal [[Western culture|Western]] texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of [[representation (arts)|representation]] that spans the entire history of Western literature, including even the [[Modernist]] novelists writing at the time Auerbach began his study.

==Overview==
''Mimesis'' gives an account of the way in which [[everyday life]] in its seriousness has been represented by many Western writers, from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers such as [[Petronius]] and [[Tacitus]], early [[Christian]] writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Medieval]] writers such as [[Chretien de Troyes]], [[Dante]], and  [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], [[Renaissance]] writers such as [[Montaigne]], [[Rabelais]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]], seventeenth-century writers such as [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]], nineteenth-century writers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]], [[Flaubert]], and [[Émile Zola|Zola]], all the way up to twentieth-century writers such as [[Proust]], and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]]. Despite his treatment of the many major works, Auerbach apparently did not think he was comprehensive enough, and apologized in the original publication in 1946 explaining that he had access only to the 'insufficient' resources available in the library at [[Istanbul University]] where he worked;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The mode of literary criticism in which ''Mimesis'' operates is often referred to among contemporary critics as [[historicism]], since Auerbach largely regarded the way reality was represented in the literature of various periods to be intimately bound up with social and intellectual conventions of the time in which they were written. Auerbach considered himself a historical [[Perspectivism|perspectivist]] in the German tradition (he mentioned [[Hegel]] in this respect) exploring specific features of [[literary genre|style]], [[grammar]], [[syntax]], and [[diction]] claims about much broader cultural and historical questions. Of ''Mimesis'', Auerbach wrote that his "purpose is always to write history."

He is in the same German tradition of [[philology]] as [[Ernst Robert Curtius|Ernst Curtius]], [[Leo Spitzer]], and [[Karl Vossler]], having a mastery of many languages and epochs and all-inclusive in its approach, incorporating just about any intellectual endeavor into the discipline of literary criticism.

Auerbach was a [[Romance language]] specialist, which explains his admitted bias towards treating texts from French compared to other languages. [[Chaucer]] and [[Wordsworth]] are not mentioned even in passing, though [[Shakespeare]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are given full chapters and [[Dickens]] and [[Henry Fielding]] make appearances.

==Position and evaluation of rhetoric==
To the consternation of his colleague, Ernst Curtius, Auerbach's work is marked by an openly anti-rhetorical position. Classical writers such as [[Homer]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Petronius]], as well as Medieval theologians (except St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]), and writers of the seventeenth century, like [[Jean Racine|Racine]], are criticized for adherence to the rhetorical doctrine of "styles" with their corresponding subject matters: the low style's association with the comedic and the popular classes, and the elevated style's association with the tragic, the historic and the heroic. Auerbach sees the Bible as opposing this rhetorical doctrine in its serious and poignant portrayals of common folk and their encounter with the divine. As Auerbach notes in chapter two when discussing the New Testament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the spirit of rhetoric&amp;mdash;a spirit which classified subjects in ''genera'' and invested every subject with a specific form of style as one garment becoming it in virtue of its nature [i.e. lower classes with the farcical low-style, upper classes with the tragic, the historic and the sublime elevated-style]&amp;mdash;could not extend its dominion to them [the Bible writers] for the simple reason that their subject would not fit into any of the known genres. A scene like Peter's denial fits into no antique genre. It is too serious for comedy, too contemporary and everyday for tragedy, politically too insignificant for history&amp;mdash;and the form which was given it is one of such immediacy that its like does not exist in the literature of antiquity.&lt;ref name="mimesis"&gt;{{cite book

The Bible will ultimately be responsible for the "[[mixed style]]" of Christian rhetoric, a style that is described by Auerbach in chapter seven as the "antithetical fusion" or "merging" of the high and low style.  The model is Christ's [[Incarnation]] as both ''sublimitas'' and ''humilitas''.  This mixture ultimately leads to a "popular realism" seen in the religious plays and sermons of the 12th Century.  Auerbach also discusses the development of an intermediate or middle style due to Medieval influences from the Bible and [[Courtly Love]] (see chapters nine and fifteen on [[Boccaccio]] and [[Molière]]). This development of an intermediate and then ultimately another "mixed style" (Shakespeare, Hugo) leads to what Auerbach calls the "modern realism" of the nineteenth-century (see chapter nineteen on [[Flaubert]]).      
  
Auerbach champions writers during periods under the sway of rhetorical forms of writing like [[Gregory of Tours]] and St. [[Francis of Assisi]], whose Latin was poor and whose rhetorical education was minimal, but who were still able to convey vivid expression and feeling. He also champions the diarist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] who wrote about the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century French court. Completely free of the absolute constraints of style found in Racine or the superficial use of reality found in [[Antoine François Prévost|Prévost]] or [[Voltaire]], Saint-Simon's portraits of court life are considered by Auerbach, somewhat surprisingly, to be the precursor of [[Proust]] (an admirer of Saint-Simon) and [[Émile Zola|Zola]].

==Critical reception==
''Mimesis'' is almost universally respected for its penetrating insights on the particular works it addresses but is frequently criticized for what is sometimes regarded as its lack of a single overarching claim. For this reason, individual chapters of the book are often read independently. Most critics praise his sprawling approach for its reveling in the complexities of each work and [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] without resorting to generalities and [[reductionism]]. 

By far the most frequently reprinted chapter is chapter one, "[[Odysseus' scar (Auerbach)|Odysseus' Scar]]" in which Auerbach compares the scene in book 19 of [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] finally returns home from his two decades of warring and journeying, to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22, the story of [[Binding of Isaac|The Binding of Isaac]]. Highlighting the rhetorically determined simplicity of characters in the ''Odyssey'' (what he calls the "external") against what he regards as the psychological depth of the figures in the [[Old Testament]], Auerbach suggests that the Old Testament gives a more powerful and historical impression than the ''Odyssey'', which he classifies as closer to "legend" in which all details are leisurely fleshed out and all actions occur in a simple present – indeed even flashbacks are narrated in the present tense.

Auerbach summarizes his comparison of the texts as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The two styles, in their opposition, represent basic types: on the one hand [''The Odyssey'' 's] fully externalized description, uniform illustration, uninterrupted connection, free expression, all events in the foreground, displaying unmistakable meanings, few elements of historical development and of psychological perspective; on the other hand [in the Old Testament], certain parts brought into high relief, others left obscure, abruptness, suggestive influence of the unexpressed, "background" quality, multiplicity of meanings and the need for interpretation, universal-historical claims, development of the concept of the historically becoming, and preoccupation with the problematic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Auerbach concludes by arguing that the "full development" of these two styles, the rhetorical tradition with its constraints on representing reality and the Biblical or "realist" tradition with its engagement of everyday experience, exercised a "determining influence upon the representation of reality in European literature."

It is in the context of this comparison between the Biblical and the Homeric that Auerbach draws his famous conclusion that the Bible’s claim to truth is "tyrannical," since &lt;blockquote&gt;  
What he [the writer of the Old Testament] produced then, was not primarily oriented towards "realism" (if he succeeded in being realistic, it was merely a means, not an end): it was oriented to truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, by the time Auerbach treats the work of [[Flaubert]] we have come full circle. Like the Biblical writers whose faith in the so-called "tyrannical" truth of God produces an authentic expression of reality, Flaubert's "faith in the truth of language" (ch. 18) likewise represents "an entire human experience."

The '''Modern Art Week''' (or '''''Semana de Arte Moderna''''', in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) was an [[arts festival]] in [[São Paulo, São Paulo|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], that ran from February 10 to February 17, 1922.  Historically, the Week marked the start of Brazilian [[Modernism]]; though a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large. For Brazil, it was as important as the International Exhibition of Modern Art (also known as the [[Armory Show]]), held in New York City in 1913, which became a legendary watershed date in the history of American art.

The Week took place at the [[Teatro Municipal de São Paulo|Municipal Theater]] in São Paulo, and included plastic arts exhibitions, lectures, concerts, and reading of poems.  In its breadth it differed significantly from the Armory Show, with which it is often compared, but which featured only [[visual art]].  It was organized chiefly by painter [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti]] and poet [[Mário de Andrade]], in an attempt to bring to a head a long-running conflict between the young modernists and the cultural establishment, headed by the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]], which adhered strictly to [[academic art|academicism]].&lt;ref name="Amaral"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amaral|first=Aracy|author2=Kim Mrazek Hastings|year=1995|title=Stages in the Formation of Brazil's Cultural Profile|journal=Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was controversial at best and divisive at worst,&lt;ref name="Amaral"/&gt; with one member of the Academy, [[Graça Aranha]], ostracized for attending. He had opened the week with a conference titled "The aesthetic emotion in modern art". Due to the radicalism (for the times) of some of their poems and music, the artists were vigorously booed and pelted by the audience, and the press and art critics in general were strong in their condemnation (such as in a famous episode by editor, writer and art critic [[Monteiro Lobato]]).&lt;ref name="Amaral"/&gt;

The group that took part in the Week, contrary to their initial intentions, did not remain a unified movement.  A number of separate groups split off, and the original core members had separated by 1929.  Two divisions predominated: the Anthropophagics (cannibalists), led by [[Oswald de Andrade]], wanted to make use of the influence of European and American artists but freely create their own art out of the regurgitations of what they had taken from abroad (thus the term anthropophagy: they would "eat" all influences, digest it, and throw out new things).  The Nationalists wanted no foreign influences, and sought a "purely Brazilian" form of art. This group was led by writer [[Plínio Salgado]], who later became a fascist political leader ([[Brazilian Integralism]]) and was arrested by dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] after a failed coup.

Before the events leading up to 1922, São Paulo was a prosperous but culturally relatively unimportant city.  However, the Week established São Paulo as the seat of the new modernist movement, against the far more culturally conservative [[Rio de Janeiro]].

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

==Artist group==
The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5333">[[File:Newman-Flower.jpg|thumb|right|Flower in 1917]]
'''Sir Walter Newman Flower''' (8 July 1879 – 12 March 1964) was an English publisher and author. He transformed the fortunes of the publishing house [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell &amp; Co]], and later became its proprietor. As an author, he published studies of the composers [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Franz Schubert]] and (as co-author) [[Arthur Sullivan]]. He also edited the million-word journals of [[Arnold Bennett]] for publication.

==Life and career==
Flower was born at [[Fontmell Magna]], [[Dorset]], England.  He was the eldest son of John Walter Flower.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt; [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U51087 "Flower, Sir (Walter) Newman",] ''Who Was Who, 1920–2007'', A &amp; C Black, London; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After schooling at the [[Whitgift School]] he entered the publishing trade in London at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 13 March 1964, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Publishing===
Flower trained under [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]] at the Harmsworth Press, after which he joined [[Cassell Illustrated|Cassell &amp; Co]] in 1906. Cassell was at that time in the doldrums, but Flower built up a stable of magazine titles that grew to dominate the British magazine market for many years.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1912 he was given charge of the book publishing branch of the company, where he brought in such authors as [[Arnold Bennett]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 1926, Cassell's magazines were sold to the Amalgamated Press, and Flower raised enough money to buy the book-publishing branch of the company, becoming proprietor and managing director in 1927. In 1938, shortly after receiving a [[knight]]hood for services to literature, he retired, but returned during [[World War II]] to look after the literary affairs of the company while his successor, his son Desmond, was on active service.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Flower commissioned [[Winston Churchill]]'s ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', which was eventually completed and published during the 1950s. During the war years, Churchill promised Flower that Cassell would be offered anything he later wrote about the war.  ''[[The Times]]'' described the result, Churchill's ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'', as "perhaps the greatest coup of twentieth century publishing."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Bertie and arthur sullivan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert Sullivan (right) with his uncle [[Arthur Sullivan|Arthur]]]]
Flower was also an author. His life of [[George Frideric Handel]] was published in 1923 and reissued in a revised edition in 1959. The book was well received, but later writers on Handel have disputed Flower's portrait of Handel as "sexless and safe".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 June 1923, p. 10; and 7 March 1985, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 29, No. 2, April 1948, pp. 177-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gary C. "'Was George Frideric Handel Gay?': On Closet Questions and Cultural Politics" in Brett, Philip, Elizabeth Wood, and Gary C. Thomas. ''Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology''. New York: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Flower collaborated with [[Herbert Sullivan]] in a biography of the latter's uncle, ''Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], his Life and Letters''. This too was well received at the time but also suffered later from critical disapproval for sanitising its subject by suppressing evidence of Sullivan's gambling and sexual liaisons.&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, Richard, ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 38, No. 3, Autumn, 1985, pp. 637-43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Flower published a study of [[Franz Schubert]], and in 1945 and 1950 he published two volumes of memoirs.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; His largest literary project was to prepare the journals of [[Arnold Bennett]] for publication – more than a million words in manuscript to be edited.  [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] later commented on "the prudish timidity of their editor, old Newman Flower. According to [[Hugh Walpole]], N. F. was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest."&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, Letter of 27 October 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Flower was twice married, first in 1903 to Evelyne Readwin of [[Wells-next-the-Sea|Wells, Norfolk]], with whom he had one son, and second in 1943 to Bridget Downes of Coore, [[County Clare]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He died at his home, Tarrant Keynston House, near [[Blandford]], Dorset, aged 84.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

'''Olive Hannibal Coates Palgrave'''  (5 April 1889 [[Cradock, Eastern Cape]] - August 1963 [[Umtali]], [[Southern Rhodesia]]) was a botanical illustrator, noted for her richly illustrated 1956 book "Trees of Central Africa".&lt;ref name="caro_Gard"&gt;{{Cite web | title =  Olive Coates Palgrave | last = Jansen | first = Carolize | work = Gardens and I | date = 2011  | accessdate = 2017-10-13 | url = http://www.carolizejansen.com/Olive-Coates-Palgrave.html | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the eldest of at least 5 children of Ada Mary Hannibal and Albert John Alfred Trollip (1857-1943), a descendant of the [[1820 Settlers]], and a Cradock sheep farmer who lost his entire flock in a snow storm, leading to his moving to Southern Rhodesia in 1895. His family joined him only in 1900, travelling by train to [[Bulawayo]] and then by the famous [[Zeederberg Coach Company]] to [[Gwelo]], the [[Matabele Rebellion]] and [[Boer War]] having delayed their departure.

Her education commenced at the [[Huguenot College]] in [[Wellington, Western Cape]] where she, and South African mycologist [[Ethel Doidge]], came under the influence of botany teacher [[Bertha Stoneman]], botanist and author of 'Plants and their ways in South Africa'. Olive finished school in 1906.

In 1915 she married Sidney Heneage Coates Palgrave, a Rhodesian civil servant. They raised a family of three sons, Roderic (Deric)(1917), Keith (1926) and Paul (1929), all of whom regularly joined in excursions to the bush. Her son Keith Coates Palgrave published ''Trees of Southern Africa'' in 1977, a work which filled a need for a comprehensive reference work compact enough to be used as a field guide. Keith's brother Paul, and Paul's wife, Meg, provided the photographs used in the book.

An '''online book''' is a resource in [[book]]-like form that is only available to read on the [[Internet]]. It differs from the common idea of an [[e-book]], which is usually available for users to download and read locally on a computer, [[smartphone]] or on an [[e-reader]]. "Book-like" means: information is presented in a page format; pages are normally available to read sequentially (though "flipping" to another page is possible using a mouse, keyboard or other controllers); and pages are read passively, with little or no interaction or multimedia. This contrasts with a text which a user is reading on an interactive [[Web 2.0]] website, which usually enables the user to click on online links, look up words or keywords online, etc.   "Online" means the content may only be read while the reader is connected to the Internet. Thus the reader's experience with an online book is similar to reading a printed book, except that the book is read at a computer and is only accessible while the reader is online. 

Online books are a common resource in [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs). For example, the [[Moodle]] VLE defines an online book in this way. Over the last few years, there has been an increase of online books that are being used for notable events or to commemorate the memory of someone. The fundraising industry often uses online books as a way to fundraise, as online books are also a way to collect donations and engage with their audience.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to '''[[fiction]]''':

'''[[Fiction]]''' &amp;ndash; [[narrative]] which is made up by the author. [[literature|Literary work]], it also includes [[theatre|theatrical]], [[film|cinematic]], [[document]]al, and [[song|musical work]]. In contrast to this is [[non-fiction]], which deals exclusively in factual events (e.g.: [[Biography|biographies]], [[History|histories]]). '''Semi-fiction''' is fiction implementing a great deal of non-fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn = 981296 | title = The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies | first1 = G. | last1 = Whiteman | first2 = N. | last2 = Phillips | journal = ERIM Report Series Research in Management | date = 13 December 2006 | issn = 1566-5283 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a fictional description based on a true story.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is fiction? ==
* Product of [[imagination]] &amp;ndash; Fiction forms pure imagination in the reader, partially because these novels are fabricated from [[creativity]] and is not pure truth; When the reader reads a passage from a novel he or she connects the words to images and visualizes the event or situation being read in their imagination, hence the word.
* Source of [[entertainment]] &amp;ndash; This type of entertainment is usually pursued to escape reality and imagine their own; which is suppressing [[Depression (mood)|depression]] with an [[emotional interest]].
* [[Genre]] &amp;ndash; any category of literature or other forms of art or culture, e.g. music, and in general, any type of discourse, whether written or spoken, audial or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria.
* Opposite of [[non-fiction]] &amp;ndash; non-fiction is the form of any narrative, account, or other communicative work whose assertions and descriptions are understood to be fact.

Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the protagonist or antagonist.
** [[Story arc]] &amp;ndash; extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a narrative arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes.

On the term "paraliterature", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] commented that "it exists. What I'm saying is that I don't want to ''perpetuate'' this division. So I would always put it in quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word that I have to use".{{sfn|Le Guin|2008|p=110}}

'''''Perfect Harmony''''' or '''''Perfect Accord''''' (French - ''L'Accord parfait'') is a 1719 painting by [[Antoine Watteau]], now in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. It was the pendant to the same artist's ''[[The Surprise (painting)|The Surprise]]''.

It was initially owned by a friend of the artist, [[Nicolas d'Hénin de Cuvillers|Nicolas Hénin]], but it and ''Surprise'' were sold separately by his heir around 1756.

'''''Picture for Women''''' is a photographic work by Canadian artist [[Jeff Wall]]. Produced in 1979, ''Picture for Women'' is a key early work in Wall's career and exemplifies a number of conceptual, material and visual concerns found in his art throughout the 1980s and 1990s. An influential photographic work, ''Picture for Women'' is a response to [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Un bar aux Folies Bergère]]''&lt;ref name="Tate Modern 2007"&gt;Gallery Guide text for the exhibition Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004, Tate Modern, London, October 21, 2005 to January 8, 2006 quoted in David Campany, "'A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women", ''Oxford Art Journal'' 20.1 (2007): 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key photograph in the shift from small-scale black and white photographs to large-scale colour that took place in the 1980s in art photography and museum exhibitions. It is the subject of a [[monograph]]ic book written by [[David Campany]] and published as part of [[Afterall|Afterall Books']] [[Afterall#One Works|One Work]] series.

==Background==
Jeff Wall, born September 29, 1946, in [[Vancouver]], is a Canadian artist best known for his large-scale back-lit [[cibachrome]] photographs and art history writing. Wall has been a key figure in Vancouver's art scene since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canadianart.ca/artist/jeff-wall/ | title=Discover must-know artists from across Canada: Jeff Wall | publisher=Canadian Art | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, he helped define the [[Vancouver School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-essay-jeff-wall/ | title=The Garden of Subjection: For Vancouver pioneer Jeff Wall, politics and beauty do mix | author=Mays, John Bentley | journal=The Walrus Magazine | date=December 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926185719/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-essay-jeff-wall/ | archivedate=September 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has published essays on the work of his colleagues and fellow Vancouverites [[Rodney Graham]], [[Ken Lum]] and [[Ian Wallace (artist)|Ian Wallace]].{{citation needed|date = September 2013}} His photographic tableaux often take Vancouver's mixture of natural beauty, urban decay and postmodern and industrial featurelessness as their backdrop.{{citation needed|date = September 2013}}

Wall experimented with conceptual art while an undergraduate student at the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Newman, "Towards the Reinvigoration of the 'Western Tableau': Some Notes on Jeff Wall and Duchamp", p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Wall then made no art until 1977, when he produced his first backlit phototransparencies.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, "Towards the Reinvigoration of the 'Western Tableau': Some Notes on Jeff Wall and Duchamp", p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these pictures are staged and refer to the history of art and philosophical problems of representation. The photographs' compositions often allude to historical artists like [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Édouard Manet]],&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Naomi ''Manet's Mirror and Jeff Wall's Picture for Women: Reflection or Refraction?'', Emaj, issue 4, 2009, [http://emajartjournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/merritt.pdf ‘Manet’s Mirror and Jeff Wall’s Picture for Women: Reflection or Refraction?’]&lt;/ref&gt; or to writers such as [[Franz Kafka]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ralph Ellison]].&lt;ref name="Newman pp. 83-4"&gt;Newman, "Towards the Reinvigoration of the 'Western Tableau': Some Notes on Jeff Wall and Duchamp", pp. 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Picture for Women'' is a 142.5 by 204.5&amp;nbsp;cm [[cibachrome]] transparency mounted on a lightbox. Along with ''The Destroyed Room'' (1978), Wall considers ''Picture for Women'' to be his first success in challenging photographic tradition.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/jeff-wall/room-guide/jeff-wall-room-1 | title=Jeff Wall: room guide, room 1 | publisher=Tate Modern | accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tate Modern]], this success allows Wall to reference "both popular culture (the illuminated signs of cinema and advertising hoardings) and the sense of scale he admires in classical painting. As three-dimensional objects, the lightboxes take on a sculptural presence, impacting on the viewer's physical sense of orientation in relationship to the work."&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;

There are two figures in the scene, Wall himself, and a woman looking into the camera. In a profile of Wall in ''[[The New Republic]]'', art critic Jed Perl describes ''Picture for Women'' as Wall's signature piece, "since it doubles as a portrait of the late-twentieth-century artist in his studio."&lt;ref name="Perl, Jed 1997 36"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Impersonal Enchantment | author=Perl, Jed | journal=New Republic |date=April 1997 | volume=216 | issue=17 | pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[David Campany]] calls ''Picture for Women'' an important early work for Wall as it establishes central themes and motifs found in much of his later work.&lt;ref name="Campany, David 2007 7"&gt;{{cite journal | title='A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women | author=Campany, David | journal=Oxford Art Journal | year=2007 | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=7 | doi=10.1093/oxartj/kcl033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edouard Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Un bar aux Folies Bergère'' (1882)]]
A response to Manet's ''Un bar aux Folies Bergère'', the Tate Modern wall text for ''Picture of Women'', from the 2005–2006 exhibition ''Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004'', outlines the influence of Manet's painting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Manet's painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet's barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer's role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet's painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.&lt;ref name="Tate Modern 2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wall produced one edition of ''Picture for Women''  which is in the collection of [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris. There is an artist's proof as well, which is in Wall's personal collection.&lt;ref name="Wall, Jeff, Theodora Vischer and Heidi Naef"&gt;{{cite book | title=Jeff Wall: Catalogue raisonné 1978–2004 | publisher=Schaulager | author=Wall, Jeff, Theodora Vischer and Heidi Naef | location=Basel | isbn=3952296724}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was photographed in a borrowed studio in Vancouver in winter 1979 and printed on two separate pieces of film which are joined using clear tape, with the transparency layers overlapping, creating a thin dark seam. The seam passes through the centre of the lens of the depicted camera.&lt;ref name="Wall, Jeff, Theodora Vischer and Heidi Naef"/&gt; The Tate Modern wall text elaborates with a quote from Wall: "The fact that it serves as a reminder of the artifice of picture making is something that Wall has come to appreciate: 'The join between the two pictures brings your eye up to the surface again and creates a dialectic that I always enjoyed and learned from painting ... a dialectic between depth and flatness. Sometimes I hide it, sometimes I don't'."&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Guide text for the exhibition Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004, Tate Modern, London, October 21, 2005 to January 8, 2006 quoted in [[David Campany]], "'A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women", ''Oxford Art Journal'' 20.1 (2007): 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Considered a key work in Wall's oeuvre,&lt;ref name="Perl, Jed 1997 36"/&gt; ''Picture for Women'' has attracted much critical attention.&lt;ref name="Campany, David 2007 7"/&gt; In 2011, ''Picture for Women'' was the subject of a monographic book by art history David Campany and published as part of Afterall Books' One Work series and has been the subject of critical writing by [[Donald Kuspit]], [[Catherine David]], Asheleigh Moorhouse, [[Rainer Rochlitz]], [[Thierry de Duve]] and Stefan Gronert.&lt;ref name="Wall, Jeff, Theodora Vischer and Heidi Naef"/&gt;

==English editions==
[[File:Den ende.png|thumb|right|''Den ende och hans egendom'' – a 1911 Swedish edition, with a foreword by [[Georg Brandes]] and afterword by [[Albert Jensen (anarchist)|Albert Jensen]].]]
===First edition (1907)===
* The first English Language Edition appeared in 1907; it was a translation by the [[United States|American]] [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], [[Steven T. Byington]] with an introduction by [[James L. Walker]]. The publisher was [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[New York City]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in New York and [[London]] up to 1931.

===Libertarian Book Club edition (1963)===
* The 1963 [[Libertarian Book Club]] edition is a re-print of the 1907 Byington translation. Edited by [[James J. Martin]] and with a cover by the son of [[Rudolf Rocker]], the edition revived interest in Stirner as an influence on [[anarchism]] and related ideologies and brought [[Max Stirner]] to a wider audience in the [[English-speaking world]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] up to 1993, sometimes with a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Harper &amp; Row - Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology (1971)===
* An [[abridged]] English edition of the Byington translation revised, selected and annotated by John Carroll. [[New York City]] / [[London]]: [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1971. 266 pp. The book appeared in a series "Roots of the Right. Readings in [[Fascist]], [[Racist]] and [[Elitist]] [[Ideology]]", together with writings by [[Gobineau]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Maurras]]. The text consists of a mix of about a hundred quotations from ''The Ego'' (and some from Stirner's minor writings), reducing the volume by about a half. The reason why Stirner's work was selected for this series remains unclear given the book's fierce anti-authoritarianism and emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual.

===Rebel Press edition (1993)===
* The 1993 Rebel Press, [[London]] edition is an unabridged republication of the 1963 re-print of the 1907 Byington translation by the Libertarian Book Club. The Rebel Press, [[London]] edition has a cover design from [[anarchist]] [[artist]] and [[cartoonist]], [[Clifford Harper]] and a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Cambridge University press edition (1995)===
* The [[Cambridge University]] press edition (ed. David Leopold, 1995) is a revised version of the original 1907 Byington translation with a new introduction by David Leopold. Leopold changed the title (His to Its) "not out of ahistorical considerations of 'political correctness' but because [[Stirner]] clearly identifies the egoistic subject as prior to gender" (p. xl). While Leopold accepted the Byington translation as "an heroic attempt to convey the readable yet idiosyncratic prose of [[Stirner]]'s original", he "made a number of amendments, such as removing infelicities and archaisms, replacing the occasional missing sentence, and restoring some of the original paragraph and sections breaks." (p. xxxix)

===Underworld Amusements edition (2017)===
* [[Individualist Anarchism|Individual Anarchist]] writer and historian Wolfi Landstreicher began his completely new translation in 2010, and published under the more literal title of "The Unique and Its Property." All prior published editions had been reproductions of, or based on the Byington translation, but Landstreicher's work constitutes the second full translation ever completed. He also wrote an introduction to it.

'''Spokane Civic Theatre''' is a nationally recognized non-profit theatre located in [[Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Incorporated in 1947, the theatre is one of the oldest [[community theatre]]s in the country. In recent years, the theatre has been brought to a level of excellence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2010/aug/29/civic-minded-leader/ Spokesman-Review. "Artistic Director Helps Civic Theatre Thrive Despite Tough Economy." Jim Kershner.]&lt;/ref&gt; that has resulted in many awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokanecivictheatre.com/awards/ Spokane Civic Theatre Website - Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's mission is "to foster an enduring love for live theatre in every community member."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokanecivictheatre.com/about-us/ Spokane Civic Theatre Website - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; Civic, as it is fondly called by the surrounding community, sets a high standard for theatre in the Spokane area.

==General==
Spokane Civic Theatre is one of few community theatres that owns its own building and land. The present facility houses two performance spaces: The Margot and Robert Ogden Main Stage Theatre and The Firth J. Chew Studio Theatre. The Main Stage auditorium is a [[proscenium]] theatre with a seating capacity of 334, while the Studio theatre is a small, black box theatre seating approximately 85.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokanecivictheatre.com/seating-chart-will-call/ Spokane Civic Theatre Website - Seating Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; The seating in the Studio theatre can be moved, which allows specific productions to fill the space in a new way, like the 2011 production of ''[[Metamorphoses (play)|Metamorphoses]]'', which housed a pool. Both stages are wheel-chair accessible, and the Main Stage also provides Sennhiser infra-red assistive listening devices and a Hearing Loop system (installed in 2014) for patrons with hearing disabilities. The backstage area houses a scene shop, sewing room, storage for props, a fully furnished green room, offices and dressing rooms. Children under the age of five, including infants, are not allowed into performances as a courtesy to other patrons.

==History==
As one of the oldest community theatres in the country, Spokane Civic Theatre is a point of pride for the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sondericker, Philip, dir. "60 Years in the Making: The Story of Spokane Civic Theatre." Narr. Patrick Treadway. 2006. Spokane Civic Theatre. DVD-ROM.&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporated in 1947, performances were held in other facilities at first, including the old Post Theater and, beginning in 1957, the Riverside Playhouse. The present facility was opened in 1967. In 1972, a three story addition was made, adjoining to the backstage area of the main theatre. This space was used for set construction, rehearsals, the costume shop, and offices for the continued upkeep of the theatre. The lower levels of the theatre, previously used as rehearsal space, were converted into a studio theatre in 1979. It was named for long-time volunteer Firth J. Chew in 1989. Currently, it is used as a [[black box theatre]], and many of the smaller or experimental productions take place there. In 2013, the Main Stage Women's restroom was expanded and a new Donor Lounge &amp; Meeting Room was added onto the building.

In addition, Civic used to be home to the [[Box and Hat Players]], a performance troupe devoted to spreading a love of musical theatre to community members of all ages. Spokane Children's Theatre also used Civic's stage at one time.

==Education==
Civic serves as a resource for local high school and college theatre departments. It also operates a theatre school - [http://spokanecivictheatre.com/about-the-academy/] - for all ages. Civic provides a variety of workshops in acting, directing, voice, dance, [[stage combat]] and technical theatre. The Academy reaches approximately 700 students per year, 100 of them taking more than one class.

The fall, winter and spring quarters run eight weeks beginning in late September, late January, and mid-April. Each class meets one day a week. The Academy also runs summer camps for those going into K-12, where students come each weekday during the morning or the afternoon. The grade school summer program uses a play-in-a-week format, rendering familiar stories like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Legend of Zelda, Star Wars and The Chronicles of Narnia into simple and fun performances. For the 7-12th grade students, there are three classes throughout the summer: a two-week Musical Theatre camp, a two-week Drama camp, and a 3-4 week Musical Performance camp.

In Summer 2011 the Musical Performance camp for the students entering grades 7-12 was changed. It was originally a program focused on finding the individual talents of each actor involved and bringing them together into a fun, original musical. The program became more like a [[summer stock]] performance, where the students have 3–4 weeks of rehearsals in which to fully memorize their lines, choreography, and music. The success of their 2011 production of ''[[Footloose (musical)|Footloose]]'' cemented the change in the program.

Each year, there are Theatre Intensives for school age students to perform. The Intensive format includes a couple weeks of rehearsal each day culminating in a ticketed performance. The proceeds from the performance go toward the [http://www.spokanecivictheatre.com/scholarship-fund/ Scholarship Fund].

Spokane Civic Theatre's Academy program also runs a scholarship program for the many students in the community who possess a love of theatre without the ability to fund a whole week at camp. Thanks to the generous contributions from the community, many scholarships have been provided to qualifying families with the over $15,000 raised per season. The community's need for scholarship has increased from approximately 10% to 30%. 

==Community Involvement==
Spokane Civic Theatre has approximately 500 volunteers who serve as actors, backstage crews, front of house, house managers, and board members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokanecivictheatre.com/volunteer/ Spokane Civic Theatre Website - Volunteer]&lt;/ref&gt; They contribute an estimated 90,000 hours every year. Volunteers return to Civic time and time again, supporting the theatre's endeavors. In addition to volunteering their time, the Spokane community has given incredible amounts in the form of donations that support the theatre and its mission.

Civic provides over 600 Main Stage tickets to help various other community organizations and individuals with their auctions and fundraisers. Civic also presents benefit performance nights for other not-for-profit groups, reaching 4,500-6,000 individuals. Many of these individuals have never been to Civic or a live stage production before.

In the fall of 2011, Civic launched the Shakespeare in Schools community outreach program. The program is free for Middle and High School students and teachers and is taught by Civic's Director of Education. Shakespeare in Schools this 2013-14 season has reached approximately 750 students and 16 teachers at 7 schools. During the fall of 2013, the Academy tested a pilot program called Creative Dramatics with the focus on Elementary school students/teachers; it received an enormous response (serving approximately 350 students, 14 teachers, and 9 schools) and will become a full program, like the Shakespeare in Schools.

For the first time in March 2014, Civic and the [[Spokane Symphony]] joined forces to present a two evening performance of the theatre's earlier hit production of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' live at the [[Fox Theater (Spokane, Washington)|Martin Woldson Theatre at the Fox]]. The joint fundraiser for the three community organizations exceeded their expectations.

==Awards==
Spokane Civic Theatre holds approximately 150 local, state, regional, and national awards for community theatre from the Inlander's Spokie awards to the American Association of Community Theatres' (AACT) Festival.

At the 2011 AACTFest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aact.org/aactfest/aactfest11.html 2011 AACTFest]&lt;/ref&gt; Spokane Civic Theatre's production of ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'' received two awards and three nominations. The awards were for Lacey Bohnet as Best Supporting Actress and Nancy Vancil for Best Musical Accompaniment.  Nominations were in the areas of Best Lighting Design, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Ensemble.

Civic has also been recognized by the city of Spokane, most recently in 2007, when then Technical Director Peter Hardie was recognized for continued artistic excellence, and Resident Director Troy Nickerson for volunteering abundant talent and resources to help raise funds for many Spokane area non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokanearts.org/awards.aspx Spokane Arts Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No. 2 in A major''' is a [[classical music|classical]] composition by American composer [[Douglas Moore]]. It was composed in 1945 and received its premiere in [[Paris]] on May 5, 1946 directed by Robert Lawrence.  In the following year the American premiere was given in Los Angeles, [[Alfred Wallenstein]] directing.

The symphony is Moore's second essay in that form and is dedicated to the memory of [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], who supplied the libretto for Moore's opera ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1938 opera)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]''. A work of moderate length and a classical conception inspired by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], it represents Moore's fully formed mature style and is unarguably one of his best pieces. Moore himself described it as: "an attempt to write in clear, objective, modified classical style, with emphasis on [[rhythm|rhythmic]] and [[melody|melodic]] momentum rather than upon sharply contrasted [[theme (music)|themes]] or dramatic climaxes".

It is in four movements, three of which end in a quiet manner. The symphony lasts approximately twenty minutes.

==Movements==
===Andante con moto; Allegro giusto===

The first movement starts with a solemnly lyric and wistful theme given out by [[trumpet]], then [[oboe]] and [[string instrument|strings]], which is carried out through the first section in a somewhat nostalgic fashion. The calmness is later abandoned in favour of a more lilting and dancelike mood on strings, which moves along in a processional way before a [[dynamics (music)|crescendo]] leads to the short [[coda (music)|coda]] ending the movement in silence. This movement features significant more use of [[percussion]], [[xylophone]] and [[triangle]], than the other three.

===Andante quieto semplice===

Whilst the symphony as a whole isn't in any way [[program music|programmatic]], the second movement was in part inspired by a [[James Joyce]] poem concerning [[twilight]] music. This is understandable, as most of the music is [[nocturne|nocturnal]] save for a few passionate outbursts which may relate to the work ''[[In memoriam (Moore)|In Memoriam]]'' of a few years earlier. It is clearly indicative of Moore's ability to write sensitive and heartfelt music.

===Allegretto===

This is the shortest and most jovial and most obviously [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] of all the movements. It starts with a happy and bubbling theme on [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s which forms the basis of the whole movement. In the more animated middle section (where the woodwind indulges in some [[Trill (music)|trill]]ing [[Baroque music|baroquery]]) a second theme on trumpet is countered by the main theme in a delightfully [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] way before winding down into stillness.

===Allegro con spirito===

The beginning of the last movement is proclaimed, in a declamatory fashion, on [[brass instrument|brass]] only to introduce the robust and energetic main theme which persists throughout. Following the introduction the orchestra leads into a [[rondo]]-like section with alternatingly rousing and flowing treatments, where the main theme dominates. After several louder [[exposition (music)|expositions]] the main theme is played out faster on strings building up a heroic atmosphere and leading to a bursting crescendo of kinetic energy after which a drumroll leads the movement to the spirited closing diminuendo.

'''''Taking the Count''''' is an 1898 painting by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is part of the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;http://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/5463&lt;/ref&gt;

This depiction of a [[prizefight]] marks Eakins' return to anatomical studies of the male figure, this time in a more urban setting. ''Taking the Count'' was his second largest canvas, but not his most successful composition.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Lloyd, ''Thomas Eakins'', Vol. II (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1982), p. 147.  {{ISBN|0-674-88490-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may be said of his ''[[Wrestlers (Eakins)|Wrestlers]]'' (1899). More successful was ''[[Between Rounds]]'' (1899), for which boxer Billy Smith posed seated in his corner at [[Philadelphia]]'s Arena; in fact, all of principal figures in this composition were posed by models re-enacting what had been an actual [[boxing]] match.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Vol. II, ''op. cit.,'' p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''telematic performance''' refers to a live performance (art, dance, music, etc.) which makes use of [[telecommunications]] and [[information technology]] to distribute the performers between two or more locations.

While this may involve use of conventional [[videoconferencing]] technology, it has more recently come to mean the use of internet technologies. Performance groups my also refer to their events as ''internet concerts'', ''online jamming'', or ''teleconcerts''.

==History==
On June 21, 1982, The first International Summer Solstice Radio Broadcast.  Created by Charlie Morrow. Produced by New Wilderness Foundation and WNYC FM. Celebrating the first day of summer (and winter below the equator) with a satellite mix of live events in Sweden, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, and Italy. The solstice jam in real time concluded the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/arts/druids-mark-solstice-euphoniously.html |title='DRUIDS' MARK SOLSTICE EUPHONIOUSLY |last1=Rockwell |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=22 June 1982 |website= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2012, a ghostpianist concert has been realized in Berlin Philharmonie. Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda played Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante op. 22 on a Yamaha Clavinova digital piano in the backstage of the hall,  sending the midi signal in real time to the robot-pianist Teo Tronico, which acted as a mirrorpianist, mirroring Prosseda's performance on the Steinway grand piano on stage with Berliner Symphoniker conducted by Michelangelo Galeati.

==Issues==
Performers and researchers work to overcome the following obstacles:

# '''Audio latency:'''  Most musicians who play in a group rely on audio cues to maintain tempo and other communication.  The most obvious example is the use of a drummer in pop music to keep time. In a normal rehearsal or performance environment, there is a delay between the time one musician plays and another hears the sound due to the speed of sound in air. This is typically from 3 - 50ms. When audio is transmitted through a digital medium (i.e. the Internet), the delay (or [[Latency (audio)|latency]]) can be much longer. Cell phones have latency of approximately 50ms. Applications such as Skype have approximately 100ms. And, QuickTime and Windows Media server-based streaming systems add 8 or more seconds of latency. When the latency is too high, the audio cues are no longer effective. Researchers&lt;ref name='lester_boley'&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lester, M, &amp; Boley, J. | title=The Effects of Latency on Live Sound Monitoring | journal=Audio Engineering Society | year=2007 }}{{Full|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--volume number, inclusive pages, and the specific page reference for this citation are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  have shown that some musicians can ignore this delay while others find it obtrusive.  In general, the higher the audio quality and the more channels transmitted, the higher the latency needs to be to reliably transmit the audio stream.
# '''Echo cancellation:''' Since the latency between locations is much higher than the speed of sound, standard techniques to eliminate feedback from monitoring systems, such as [equalization], do not work. However, when the latency between locations is low enough, teleconferencing [[echo cancellation]] techniques can be used.
# '''Video latency:''' Musicians also rely on visual cues to maintain synchronization. The most obvious example is the use of a conductor with orchestral music. Due to the size of video data, latency tends to higher for video than audio latency.
# '''Audio/video synchronization:''' In order to maintain audio and video synchronization, audio may be delayed more than necessary. Some performers opt to sacrifice AV synchronization for lower audio latency. For example, those involved with [[improvised]], musical telematic performances may require low latency audio cues.

'''''The Fall of the Titans''''' is an [[oil painting]] of the [[Titanomachy]] by the Dutch painter [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] in 1588–1590. It measures {{nowrap|239 × 307 cm}} {{nowrap|(94 × 121 in)}}. The work is in the collection of the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Statens Museum]] (the national art gallery) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].  It is an ambitious work of the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], and a display of the artist's ability to devise and depict a large number of varied poses for the male nudes.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] were members of the second generation of divine beings, descending from the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial deities]] and preceding the [[Twelve Olympians#Olympians|Olympians]]. Based on [[Mount Othrys]], the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of [[Gaia]] (Mother Earth) and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Father Sky). They ruled during the legendary [[Golden Age]], and also comprised the first [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of Greek deities.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the Titan [[Cronus]] overthrew his father Uranus, the Titans were overthrown by Cronus's children (Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera and Demeter), the core Olympian deities, in the [[Titanomachy]] (or "War of the Titans"), at the end of which they were imprisoned in [[Tartarus]], a Greek version of [[Hell]].  Their arrival there is depicted in the painting. 

The painting was bought by King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in 1621, and followed most of the royal collection into public ownership in the Statens in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">:''The Norka is also the name of a restaurant in Akron, Colorado.''

'''The Norka''' is a fairy tale from [[Andrew Lang]]'s ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''. Lang gives no source for the tale, but it is taken verbatim from the book Russian Folk-tales by W. R. S. Ralston, published in 1873 by Smith, Elder, &amp; co. and re-published by [[Kessinger Publishing]] in 2004.

The King is unable to destroy the Norka, a huge beast who is devouring his animals. He offers half his kingdom to any one of his sons who kills the Norka. The two eldest sons drink and revel instead of hunting the beast. The youngest third son, a simpleton, wounds and chases the beast. The beast escapes under a great stone. The third son descends to the underworld and meets a talking horse who calls him Ivan and takes him to a copper palace owned by a beautiful woman, a sister of the Norka. He travels to a silver palace and a golden palace, also owned by the sisters of the Norka. The third and youngest sister tells him that Norka is asleep on the sea. She gives him a sword and the Water of Strength, and tells him to cut off her brother's head with a single stroke. He cuts off the Norka's head, which says "Well, I'm done for now!", and rolls into the sea. 

The three sisters are in love with him, so he takes them with him to the surface world. They change their palaces into eggs with magic, teach him how to do it, and give him the eggs. His brothers pull the three maidens up, but try to kill the third son by cutting the rope halfway up. He substituted a stone for himself, however, so he was not killed. Stranded in the underworld, he sadly wandered away as it rains. He covers some baby birds with his coat to protect them from the rain. The giant mother bird is grateful and carries him to the surface.

A tailor tells him that the two princes are going to marry the maidens from the underworld, but the maidens refuse to be married until wedding dresses are made in the underworld style, and without measuring them. The third son tells the tailor to accept the job to make the clothes for the wedding. At night, the third son turns the eggs into palaces, takes the maiden's clothes from the palaces, and turns the palaces into eggs again. He gives the dresses to the tailor who is paid richly by the King. He visits the shoemaker and other artificers and does the same thing. The youngest maiden recognizes him (in rags), grabs him, and takes him to the palace. She explains to the king what happened and that the brothers threatened to kill them if they said the third son was alive. The King punishes the two brothers. Three weddings are celebrated.

'''''Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time''''' (also called '''''An Allegory of Venus and Cupid''''' and '''''A Triumph of Venus''''') is an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting by the [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Agnolo Bronzino]]. It is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/bronzino-an-allegory-with-venus-and-cupid|title=bronzino-an-allegory-with-venus-and-cupid|publisher=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

About 1546, Bronzino was commissioned to create a painting that has come to be known as ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Cupid]], [[Folly (allegory)|Folly]], and [[Time (mythology)|Time]]''. It displays the ambivalence, eroticism, and obscure imagery that are characteristic of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period, and of Bronzino's master [[Pontormo]].

The painting may have been commissioned by [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] or by [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]], to be presented by him as a gift to [[Francis I of France]]. [[Vasari]] wrote that it was sent to King Francis, though he does not specify by whom. The erotic imagery would have appealed to the tastes prevalent in both the [[Medici]] and French courts at this time. The attention to [[Texture (painting)|texture]] and wealth is also consistent with Bronzino's [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] patronage. The painting was brought by [[Napoleon]] from [[Paris]] to [[Vienna]], where in 1813, Johann [[House of Keglević|Keglević]] gained possession of the painting from [[Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiens lebende Schriftsteller, Künstler und Dilettanten im Kunstfache: dann Bücher-, Kunst- und Naturschätze und andere Sehenswürdigkeiten dieser Haupt- und Residenz-Stadt : ein Handbuch für Einheimische und Fremde, Seite 319, Franz Heinrich Böckh, Bauer, Wien 1821.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budapest"&gt;The masters of mannerism, Museum of fine arts Budapest, page 29, Szépművészeti Múzeum (Hungary), Marianne Haraszti-Takács, Taplinger Pub. Co., New York 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1860 it has been in London.

The figure of Venus can be likened to a precious object (such as a marble statue) in a luxurious setting, desirable because of her unavailability. In this large, unusually cold composition, which is deliberately constructed on a counterpoint of opposing movements, the finest work is in the treatment of the faces. Bronzino, known above all as a portrait painter, painted several carefully drawn portraits of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].&lt;ref name="Budapest" /&gt;
==Scholarly debate==
[[Image:Angelo Bronzino Det 004.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Venus and Cupid detail.]]

Crowded into the claustrophobic foreground of the painting are several figures whose identities have been the subject of extensive scholarly debate. At times it has also been called ''A Triumph of Venus''. Its meaning, however, remains elusive. Cupid, along with his mother (Venus) and the nude [[putto]], to the right, are all posed in a typical Mannerist ''[[figura serpentinata]]'' form.

The two central figures are easily identified by their attributes as Venus and Cupid. For example, she holds the golden apple she won in the [[Judgement of Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html|title=Judgement of Paris|publisher=www.theoi.com|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~hughesc/judgment_of_Paris.htm Aphrodite equals Venus]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris/26781 peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris + Venus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126105844/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris/26781 |date=November 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while he sports the characteristic wings and [[quiver]].  Both figures are nude, illuminated in a radiant white light. Cupid fondles his mother's bare breast and kisses her lips.

The bearded, bald figure to the upper right of the scene is believed to be Time, in view of the hourglass behind him.&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt; He sweeps his arm forcefully out to his right. Again, it is difficult to interpret his gesture with any certainty; it could be to prevent the figure at the far left of the picture from shielding the incestuous transgressions of Venus and the adolescent Cupid with the billowing blue fabric that provides a screen between the figures in the fore and background. Many scholars believe that his gesture seems to say "Time is fleeting, and you never know when it may be all over." The figure opposite Time, and also grasping at the drapery, is usually called [[Eternal oblivion|Oblivion]] because of  the lack of substance to his form—eyeless sockets and mask-like head. The mask-like face of this figure is echoed by the image of two actual masks in the lower right-hand corner.

There is also Folly, to the right of Venus and Cupid.{{expand section|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- You mention Oblivion behind Folly...--&gt;

The identity of the remaining figures is even more ambiguous. The old woman rending her hair (see detail at right) has been called [[Jealousy]]—though some believe her to represent the ravaging effects of [[syphilis]]&lt;ref name="nag"&gt;[[National Gallery (London)|The National Gallery]]. 2001. [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng651 An Allegory with Venus and Cupid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525092014/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng651 |date=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (result of unwise intercourse). The creature at the right-hand side behind Folly, with a girl's face and disjointed, grotesque body, extending a [[honeycomb]] with her left hand attached to her right arm, and hiding behind her back a scorpion's barb, may represent Pleasure and [[Fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;'Fraude' as interpreted by Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology'', Harper Torchbooks (New York, Harper and Row, 1962), pp. 86–91 (originally pub. by Oxford University Press, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt; There is, however, no consensus on these identifications.&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt;

'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William Morris Agency''' ('''WMA''') was a Hollywood-based [[talent agency]]. It represented some of the best known 20th century entertainers in film, television, and music. During its 109 year tenure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=872395|work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate= May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it came to be regarded as the "first great talent agency in show business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cullen |first=Frank |date= |title=Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA1020&amp;lpg=PA1020&amp;dq=William+Morris,+Vaudeville+Agent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5vrFnOvcwZ&amp;sig=gRTUu6ORD7BLKacr3_Z6756jTxk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFk8rMy87KAhVhYKYKHe4tCAAQ6AEIUzAN#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Morris%2C%20Vaudeville%20Agent&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Routledge |page=1020 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, WMA announced it would merge with the [[Endeavor Talent Agency]] to form [[William Morris Endeavor]] which owns Miss Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Littleton| first = Cynthia | title = WMA, Endeavor approve merger | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1898, William Morris (born Zelman Moses), a German Jewish immigrant to the US, posted a cross-hatch trademark above an office door in New York City{{spaced ndash}} four "X's", representing a W superimposed on an M&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/william-morris-agency-inc-history/|title=William Morris Agency, Inc. History|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=fundinguniverse.com |publisher= |access-date= 29 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}} and went into business as '''William Morris, Vaudeville Agent'''. By the time WMA formally incorporated in New York State on January 31, 1918, Morris' son [[William Morris Jr.]] and an office boy named [[Abe Lastfogel|Abraham Lastfogel]], who, after becoming a talent agent in his own right, entered into a business partnership with Morris Sr.

As silent film grew into widely viewed entertainment, Morris encouraged his clients to experiment in the new medium. Stars such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Al Jolson]], the [[Marx Brothers]], and [[Mae West]] were all represented by the company.

By 1930, Morris had turned over leadership of the agency to his son and Lastfogel. In 1932, five years after his retirement, William Morris, Sr. died from heart failure. By that time, the Agency had begun the process of relocating from [[Hollywood and Vine]] to Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brokawcompany.com/pop-ups/read_cnn_profile.html|title= A Charmed Life, or a Thirty-Six Short Makes It Big |publisher=The Brokaw Company|accessdate= November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1945 to 2000 ===

The William Morris Agency attained further industry dominance with the December 1949 acquisition of the Berg-Allenberg Agency.  The senior agent in the motion picture department during the 1950s was [[Mike Zimring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisbord|first=Merrily|title=Our future selves : love, life, sex, and aging|year=1991|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1556431456|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1965, WMA's Music Department had emerged as an industry powerhouse, representing, among others, the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], [[the Beach Boys]], and [[the Byrds]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Less than 10 years later, in 1973, the Agency's newly established Nashville office provided another significant boost to the operations of William Morris, extending the Agency's reach into [[country music]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/16/business/fi-morris16 |title=Morris Targets Miami's Talent|author=Claudia Eller|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date =January 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, WMA built the William Morris Plaza located at 150 El Camino Drive, directly across the street from its main building at 151 El Camino. In 1989, WMA acquired the [[Jim Halsey]] Company.

In the early 1990s, WMA's Literary Department announced the largest book-to-screen deal ever inked when it sold the television rights for ''Scarlett'', the sequel to [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]''. In 2000, WMA acquired The Writers Shop, which was owned by [[Jennifer Rudolph Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Rudolph Walsh|url=http://leanin.org/stories/jennifer-rudolph-walsh/|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-2000 ===
WMA's Miami Beach office opened in 2003, and WMA's [[Shanghai]] office opened in 2004. In 2007, the Agency expanded its London music operation, underscoring WMA's continued commitment to the international marketplace. Along with the addition of new personnel, the London office moved into the iconic Centre Point Tower.

In 2003, a seismic shift occurred in the agency landscape when WMA's SVP and Theatre topper, George Lane, and fellow agent in charge of foreign rights, Michael Cardonick, left WMA to open Creative Artists Agency's New York City office and Theatrical Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Hofler |url=https://variety.com/2003/legit/markets-festivals/caa-opening-gotham-digs-1117881929/|title=CAA opening Gotham digs |publisher=Variety.com |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 merger with Endeavor ==
{{Main|William Morris Endeavor}}

On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were merging to form '''William Morris Endeavor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = Latest WMA-Endeavor Merger Update: Hollywood History In The Making Today: Endeavor And William Morris Vote Yes | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/04/latest-wma-endeavor-merger-update/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endeavor executives [[Ari Emanuel]] and [[Patrick Whitesell]] were widely recognized as the architects of the deal and ultimately took the roles of WME Co-CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice-Chairman, in 1999.  He had joined WMA as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and had risen to Board Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/business/27steal.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1262095435-iFfjNHxKyP6WEeNLa5Tssw |title=Layoffs in the William Morris-Endeavor Merger  |author=Michael Cieply |date= December 26, 2009 |work= [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the merger, WMA permanently relocated its offices to the Endeavor building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The WMA Agent Training Program ==
The WMA Agent Training Program, often referred to as the "mailroom", was established in the 1940s and is well known for its roster of successful alumni. Since the 1970s the program has been replicated at other talent agencies and studios, many of which were headed by former mailroom trainees. Once accepted, trainees rotate through different departments, starting with the mailroom, before becoming a full-time assistant or coordinator.

WMA's longtime competitor, [[Creative Artists Agency]], was founded in 1975 by [[Michael Ovitz]], [[Ronald Meyer]], William Haber, [[Michael S. Rosenfeld]], and Rowland Perkins, all former WMA agent trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rose | first=Frank | title=The Agency | edition=First | year=1996 | publisher=Harper Business | location=New York | isbn=0887308074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rensin 2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rensin | first=David | title=The Mailroom | edition=First | year=2003 | publisher=Ballantine Books | location=New York | isbn=0345442350}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Geffen]] once called the WMA Agent Training Program "The Harvard School of Show Business &amp;ndash; only better: no grades, no exams, a small stipend and great placement opportunities."{{cn|date=March 2017}} Graduates from the Training Program were perceived at a high level of prestige within the entertainment industry, because of the caliber of notable alums that have graduated from the program.&lt;ref name="Rensin 2003" /&gt;{{rp|464}}

Former Chairman [[Norman Brokaw]] became the first mailboy in the Beverly Hills Mailroom at age 15. The Agent Training program still exists today at William Morris Endeavor. It was famously documented in David Rensin's 2003 book, ''[[The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up]]''.
