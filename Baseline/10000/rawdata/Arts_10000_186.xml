The year '''1938 in film''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*January - [[MGM]] announces that [[Judy Garland]] will be cast in the role of "Dorothy" in the upcoming ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' film. [[Ray Bolger]] is cast as the "Tinman" and [[Buddy Ebsen]] as the "Scarecrow". At Bolger's insistence, the roles are switched between the two actors. On July 25, MGM announces [[Bert Lahr]] has been cast as the "Cowardly Lion".
*April 5 - [[Noel Langley]] completes the first script for ''The Wizard of Oz''.
*April 20 - Leonard Slye appears in his first starring role as [[Roy Rogers]] in ''[[Under Western Stars]]''. He became one of the most popular [[Western (genre)|Western]] stars being ranked number one from 1943 to 1952 and would become known as "King of the Cowboys".
*May 7 - Lyricist [[Edgar Yipsel Harburg]] and composer, [[Harold Arlen]], begin work on the musical score for ''The Wizard of Oz''.
*October 13 - Filming starts on ''The Wizard of Oz''.
*October 21 - [[Buddy Ebsen]] suffers from a near fatal allergic reaction to the aluminum dust used in his "Tinman" make-up on the set of ''The Wizard of Oz''. Ebsen is replaced by [[Jack Haley]].
*December 23 - [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] is severely burned during a mishap on the set of ''The Wizard of Oz''. Hamilton, who was cast in the role of the "Wicked Witch", leaves the film for six weeks.
*[[Orson Welles]] makes ''[[Too Much Johnson]]'', starring [[Joseph Cotten]]. It is never completed and first released only in [[2013 in film|2013]].

==Top-grossing films (U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Box Office Digest, March 1939, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;==
At the time, box office numbers were reported as a percentage of business for each theater in comparison to 'normal' business. For example, ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' performed at 227% and ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' at 170%.  This is why exact dollar grosses for films are unreliable at best.

'''''Aftermath''''' is a 1994 Spanish [[Horror film|horror]] [[short film]] written and directed by [[Nacho Cerdà]]. Containing no spoken dialogue, ''Aftermath'' is the second installment in a trilogy of shorts by Cerdà, preceded by 1990's ''The Awakening'', and followed by 1998's ''Genesis''.

== Plot ==

A woman named Marta Arnau Marti dies in a car crash, after accidentally running over a dog. An orderly wheels Marta's body into a morgue drawer, past a mourning couple, who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace. The orderly overhears two workers [[autopsy]]ing a pair of male bodies, looks in on them out of curiosity, and leaves when one of the morticians (who is disturbingly enthused by his duties) glares at him. The morticians complete their work on the dead men, and while one leaves, the other remains, and brings in Marta's body.

Aroused by Marta, the mortician locks himself in the morgue with her body, undresses it, removes the brain, and caresses it with a knife, which he uses to mutilate Marta's vagina, and cut open her torso. The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta's breasts and innards, then takes photographs of his handiwork. Unable to contain his lust any longer, the mortician engages in [[necrophilia]], after setting his camera on automatic to record the event.

Afterward, the mortician autopsies Marta, cleans up, and leaves. In his home, the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta's stolen heart into a pulp, which he gives to his dog before proceeding to relax in his sitting room. As a baby's cries emanate from the television, the scraps of newspaper the dog is eating the heart off of are shown to contain Marta's obituary.

== Reception ==

[[Dread Central]] wrote, "It is intense. It is unflinching. Yet, at its core it is subtle, hauntingly beautiful, and every bit as rich in detail and composition as any other great film has ever been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/aftermathgenesis-dvd#axzz2mn0d29Kz|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis'' (DVD)|last = Bostaph|first = D. W.|work = [[Dread Central]]|date = 24 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Talk]] awarded four and a half out of five stars and wrote, "The necrophilia in this movie is very disturbing. It is not just carnal; it is filled with volatility and extreme violence. While nothing is shown outright, the implication is repellent enough. Indeed, one could argue that Cerdà is making a larger point about defying death. But it's a hard sell. Treating the departed as nothing more than a plaything for the fulfillment of one's most twisted desires almost erases any grander theme. While the ending is quite unnerving, the rest of ''Aftermath'' is an equally uneasy ordeal. You may see nothing more in it than [[fetishism]] gone foul, however. Or you may see something very insightful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17184/aftermath-genesis/|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis''|last = Gibron|first = Bill|work = [[DVD Talk]]|date = 23 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it four and half out of five stars and wrote, "Aftermath, is definitely one of the most controversial films of the last couple of decades. Its ruthless and realistic depiction of grisly autopsies and a sinister surgeon with an inclination towards violent necrophilia has some of the hardest scenes to stomach in any horror movie, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109542/aftermathgenesis-v-2/|title=Aftermath/Genesis (V)|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Resistance Association of Literary and Art Workers''' (Zhonghua quanguo wenyijie kangdi xiehui 中华全国文艺界抗敌协会) was an organization founded on 27 March 1938 to unite cultural workers in China against the Japanese invaders during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It was led by the politically neutral writer [[Lao She]] and membership ranged from 100 to 400 writers during the years of the organization's existence. Notable members included [[Mao Dun]], [[Ding Ling]], [[Ba Jin]], [[Lin Yutang]], [[Shi Zhecun]], and many others.

[[Image:Anna Camaiti.jpg|thumb|upright|Anna Camaiti Hostert]]
'''Anna Camaiti Hostert''' (born July 19, 1949, in [[Florence]], Italy) is an [[Italian American]] philosopher and a scholar of [[Visual Studies]]. She lives and works between Italy and the United States.

==Biography==
She obtained her degree in Philosophy at the [[University of Pisa]] (Italy) defending a dissertation with the philosopher Nicola Badaloni. Then she received a Ph.D in Literature and Film from the [[University of Chicago]]. She has taught at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois, Chicago]], and at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] (Italy). She was ''Visiting Professor'' at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in Los Angeles and at the Florence campus of the [[New York University]] (NYU) Tisch School of Cinema. She was also ''Distinguished Visiting Professor'' at [[Florida Atlantic University]] (FAU) in Boca Raton. She was Acting Associate Dean at the [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]]’s campus in Rome.

In 1999 she founded along the philosopher [[Mario Perniola]] the magazine ''[[Agalma (journal)|Agalma: Magazine of Aesthetic and Cultural Studies]]'' of whose editorial committee she is still a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013182427/http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |archive-date=2012-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986 she has been part of the Italian Bar Association of Journalists and for several years the press attaché to the Governor of Tuscany Region. Later, she had a TV program about cinema on RaiSat channel titled ''Metix'' from the title of one of her books. She has been a guest at numerous Film Festivals in Italy and of several TV and radio cultural programs. She has collaborated with the director [[Fiorella Infascelli]] in the movie ''Italiani'' presented at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1998.

She has written for the newspaper ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' .

==Thought==

===History of philosophy and politics===
The initial period of Camaiti Hostert’s research focused on the history of political philosophy following the methodological analysis of Nicola Badaloni, under whose tutelage she studied at the University of Pisa. In her first work, ''Giuseppe Toniolo. Alle origini del partito cattolico'' (1984; ''Giuseppe Toniolo. The origins of the Catholic Party'') – that resulted from her dissertation in Philosophy – she traced the intellectual biography of the thinker [[Giuseppe Toniolo]], by retrieving his prominent figure in the Catholic Movement, and casting light on his role in the subsequent foundation of the first Catholic Party in its relationship with the Marxist concept of the main political subject.

The same historical-philosophical perspective defines also the second work by Camaiti Hostert titled ''Politica e diritto di resistenza. Kant ed Erhard: democrazia e libertà del soggetto'' (1987, ''The Politics and the Right of Resistance. Kant and Erhard: Democracy and Human Freedom''). In this work Camaiti Hostert has traced the relationship between the German Jacobinism, of which Johann Benjamin Erhard is one of the most representative authors, and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s theory of Public Right, Political Will and Civil Liberty. Through the concepts of «resistance» and «insurrection», she interprets Erhard’s theses as an attempt to build a theory of the antagonistic subject.

===Cultural studies and identity theory===
Because of her intellectual, academic and existential relation with the United States and with the socio-cultural dynamics of this country, Camaiti Hostert first developed themes related to [[comparative literature]] (see for instance her afterword to the American edition of the [[Dacia Maraini]]’s novel, ''The Silent Duchess'', Feminist Press 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/books/the-silence.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Anna+Camaiti+Hostert&amp;st=nyt|title=The Silence|first=Kathryn|last=Harrison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amatangelo, S. 2002. «Coming to Her Senses: The Journey of the Mother in La Lunga Vita Di Marianna Ucria». ''Italica : Bulletin of the American Association of Teachers of Italian''. 79&lt;/ref&gt;) and then has moved towards the [[Cultural studies]] with the analysis of the [[Post-colonial theory|post-colonial theories]], especially by focusing on the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern subject]] and on identity construction.

Through this research, Camaiti Hostert engages a sometimes critical confrontation with many important cultural theorists like [[Edward Said]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and [[Homi K. Bhabha]] and with political thinkers, like [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Her major work in this field of investigation is ''Passing. Dissolvere le identità, superare le differenze'' (''Passing. A Strategy to Dissolve Identities and Remap Differences''). Dealing with the complex theme of [[Alterity]] as it relates to the Italian women’s movement, especially to the works of Carla Lonzi&lt;ref&gt;E. Chiti Lucchesi, «Luoghi del non ritorno: sogni, parole e immagini», in Borghi, Liana, and Uta Treder (eds). ''Il globale e l'intimo: luoghi del non ritorno''. Perugia: Morlacchi, 2007: 59&lt;/ref&gt; and the theories of sexual difference, the analysis of ''Passing'' tackles the [[feminist studies]], particularly the point of convergence between [[Post-colonial studies|post-colonial]] and [[gender studies]] ([[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri C. Spivak]], [[bell hooks]], [[Teresa de Lauretis]], [[Rosi Braidotti]]) and from that point it expands its reflection to the process of formation of any ethnic and sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, Michael, and Antonio Negri. ''Empire''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000: 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lingel, Jessa. 2009. «Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory». ''Journal of Bisexuality''. 9, no. 3-4:381-405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual studies and film theory===
Visual Studies - that were born as a field of interdisciplinary research on the wake of the Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]] – have become since the late ‘90s the focus of Camaiti Hostert’s research. In ''Metix. Cinema globale e cultura visuale'' (Meltemi 2004, ''Metix. Global Cinema and Visual Culture'') - work that collects Camaiti Hostert’s findings during those years - she has analyzed the structure of the vision, the dynamics of the gaze and the processes of images production in contemporary cinema (mainly American cinema, but not only [[Hollywood]]).

Visual Studies in general and Camaiti Hostert’s work in particular, interpret images not as isolated objects, but as clusters of several practices which change use and meaning of the images themselves: if cinema represents the medium from which Camaiti Hostert’s analysis has begun, her analysis expands to all visual languages, including TV, advertisings, Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Marie-Christine. 2012. «Culture populaire et séries télévisées». ''Amerika''. no. 6. http://amerika.revues.org/2969&lt;/ref&gt; The pivotal passage of the text is the transition from the idea that an image is able to mean something, to the understanding that this ability is tied with the formation of the subject identity.

According to Camaiti Hostert’s theory [[Visual Studies]] show the similarities between the analysis of the [[visual culture]] and the analysis of the construction of cultural, gender and ethnic identities and differences, with particular attention to the unmasking of visual stereotypes that have represented the various forms of marginality.&lt;ref&gt;De Ruggieri, Francesca. ''Matrix and the city: il corpo ibrido nel cinema e nella cultura visuale''. Pisa: ETS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work is linked to Camaiti Hostert’s parallel research into the field of [[Film Studies]]. Regarding  this domain of studies, the two particularly relevant essays collection (both edited in 2002) are ''Sentire il cinema'' (2002; ''Feeling Cinema'') - entirely composed of Camaiti Hostert’s essays and interviews (with directors such [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Fiorella Infascelli]], Wilma Labate and [[Mario Martone]]) – and ''Scene italoamericane. Rappresentazioni cinematografiche degli italiani d’America'' edited with the Italian American scholar [[Anthony Julian Tamburri]] (Luca Sossella editore 2002, American edition ''Screening Ethnicity. Cinematographic Representations of Italian Americans in the United States'', [[Bordighera Press]], 2002 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1432/is_2_80/ai_n29018668/?tag=content;col1 |title=CBSi |publisher=FindArticles.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;), including essays by [[Ben Lawton]], Fred Gardaphé, Alberto Abruzzese among others as well as by Camaiti Hostert and Tamburri.

Several artists are given 20 minutes to create a painting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/living/article/873561--brush-with-greatness&lt;/ref&gt; Each audience member gets to vote on the painting they like the most by placing a ballot for that round (given at the door) in that artist's collection box.  There are 2 or 3 preliminary rounds in which the most popular artists move on to the final round.  The artist who gets the most ballots in the final round is declared the winner.  All the paintings are then auctioned off to the audience members.  Any painting that doesn't reach its minimum bid is destroyed with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=3038846 |title=Art Battle brings a paint brawl to the walls of Queen West in Toronto |last=Grainger |first=Lia |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc |work=[[National Post]] |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marketing, '''art infusion''' is the general influence of [[work of art|artwork]]s on perceptions and evaluations of products with which the artworks are associated.

The term was first introduced in an article in the [[Journal of Marketing Research]] in 2008. [[Henrik Hagtvedt]] and Vanessa Patrick, the two researchers who authored the article, demonstrated a favorable influence of artworks on consumer evaluations of non-art products that were associated with the artworks via, for instance, advertising or [[product design]]. The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of [[Prehistory|human prehistory]], and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non-utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">'''Art of Cesar Department''' refers to the expressions of art in the [[Colombia]]n [[Departments of Colombia|Department]] of [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]]. The diverse range of human activities and artifacts, painting, sculpture, printmaking, musical and dance expressions, literature and other forms of visual and auditory arts. 

The art in Cesar Department is sponsored by the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Culture]], and the local [[Department Secretaries of Cesar Department|Department Secretary]] of [[Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports|Education, Culture and Sports]].

==History of art in Cesar Department==

The first expressions of art in the Cesar Department were developed by the indigenous people's traditions, present since their arrival from [[Mesoamerica]] and the Caribbean. Then there are different cultural expressions from the extinct [[Taironas]], the [[Arhuacos]], [[Kankuamos]] mostly present in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range. The culture of the Arhuacos is specially rich in sawing wool and ''[[fique]]'', drawings on stones, pottery, work on wood, and other handicrafts. 

With [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|the arrival of the Spanish]] the European art expressions were also introduced, and the Spanish also introduced the African slaves who developed their own artistic expressions in the Cesar Department based on their African heritage. Due to the process of independence from Spain and the political struggle that followed, art expressions in Cesar Department decreased, only maintaining some of the indigenous traditional art, poetry, musical expressions that developed like ''[[cumbia]]'' and ''[[vallenato]]''. The musical expression was born from the strong storytelling tradition, inherited from the three cultural expressions of local indigenous peoples, Europeans and African descendants.&lt;ref name="colarte.com"&gt;[http://www.colarte.com/colarte/conspintores.asp?idartista=16675 Colarte.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th Century and with the creation of [[Cesar Department]] the creation of local government secretaries intended to support and develop artistic expressions were created. in the Cesar Department the governor created the [[Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports|Education, Culture and Sports]]. Each municipal administration depending on its budget created a secretary of culture or through an associated institution such as the ''Casa de la Cultura'' (Cultural house) or the ''Escuela de Bellas Artes'' Fine Arts School in [[Valledupar]].

==Painting==

During the 1970s and with the support from the local government and society, many painters, Some of this new generation were represented by [[Walter Arland]], [[Ineris Cuello]], [[Rita Hinojosa]], [[Eivar Moya]], [[Efrain Quintero Molina]], [[Celso Castro]] (also a photographer), [[Franklin Ramos]], [[Maria Liliana Mejia]], [[Jose Anibal Moya]], [[Alvaro Palomino]], among others.&lt;ref name="colarte.com"/&gt;

[[Image:Covent Garden 1762.gif|thumb|right|240px|A theatrical riot at Covent Garden's Royal Theatre in 1762 over a rumored increase in ticket prices. Although drama declined in the Augustan era, it was still popular entertainment.]]

'''''Augustan drama''''' can refer to the [[drama]]s of [[Ancient Rome]] during the reign of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], but it most commonly refers to the [[English drama|plays of Great Britain]] in the early 18th century, a subset of 18th-century [[Augustan literature]]. King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] referred to himself as "Augustus," and the poets of the era took this reference as apropos, as the [[Latin literature|literature of Rome]] during Augustus moved from historical and didactic poetry to the poetry of highly finished and sophisticated [[Epic poetry|epic]]s and [[satire]].

In [[poetry]], the early 18th century was an age of [[satire]] and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the developing [[novel]]. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful [[Restoration comedy]], the pathetic [[she-tragedy]] of the turn of the 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and what it meant to be [[gentry]]: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.

Augustan drama has a reputation as an era of decline. One reason for this is that there were few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of [[wit]]s made the stage political and aggressive again, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry stepped in and began official [[censorship]] that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for [[special effects]] to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel.

==The middle-class tragedy==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy}}
As for prose and poetry, there is no clear beginning to the "Augustan era" in drama, but the end is clearly marked. Augustan-era drama ended definitively in 1737 with the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]]. Prior to 1737, the English stage was changing rapidly from [[Restoration comedy]] and [[Restoration drama]] and their noble subjects to the quickly developing [[melodrama]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R-Steele.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Richard Steele]], collaborator of [[Joseph Addison]]'s and author of ''The Conscious Lovers'']] --&gt;
[[George Lillo]] and [[Richard Steele]] wrote the trend-setting plays of the early Augustan period. Lillo's plays consciously turned from heroes and kings toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale rather than a national scale, and the ''[[hamartia]]'' and ''[[agon]]'' in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sin]]. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and [[repentance]]. Steele's ''The Conscious Lovers'' (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a [[duel]]. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Further, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns.

[[Joseph Addison]] also wrote a play entitled ''Cato'' in 1713, but it did not inspire followers. ''Cato'' concerned the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Cato the Younger|statesman]] who opposed [[Julius Caesar]]. The year of its première is important for understanding why the play is unique, for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was seriously ill at the time, and both the [[Tory]] ministry of the day and the Whig opposition (already led by [[Robert Walpole]]) were concerned about the succession. Both groups were in contact with Anne's exiled brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]. Londoners sensed this anxiety, for Anne had no surviving children; all of the closest successors in the [[House of Stuart|Stuart family]] were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Therefore, the figure of Cato was a transparent symbol of Roman integrity. The Whigs saw in him a Whig refusal to accept an [[Divine Right of Kings|absolute monarch]] from the House of Stuart, while the Tories saw in him a resistance to rule by a triumphant general ([[John Churchill]], the Duke of Marlborough, whose wife Sarah was rumored to control Anne). Further, Cato's claim that Caesar profited by illegal war echoed the Tory accusations against Marlborough. Both sides cheered the play, even though Addison was himself clearly Whig and had meant the play as something near [[propaganda]]. [[John Home]]'s play ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' (1756) would have a similar fate to ''Cato'' in the next generation after the [[Licensing Act]].

==The problem of "Spectacle"==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|left|260px|"Rich's Glory": [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] takes control of Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. The first play he would stage was ''[[The Way of the World]]''.]]
As during the Restoration, economic reality drove the stage during the Augustan period. Under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] court patronage meant economic success, and therefore the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer, and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays.  However, after the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], the court and crown stopped taking a great interest in the playhouse. Theaters had to get their money from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] plays were made and ran, but the ''new'' plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was "[[spectacle]]": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects.

===Pantomime and tableau spectacle===
The public attended when they saw their lives represented on the stage, but also attended when there was a sight that would impress them.  If costumes were lavish, the sets impressive or the actresses alluring, audiences would attend.  The [[Restoration spectacular]] had seen the development of English opera and [[oratorio]] and a war between competing theaters to produce the most expensive and eye-popping plays.  However, these [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] productions could mean financial ruin as much as security, and neither of the two main playhouses could continue the [[brinksmanship]] for long.  After these battles between the playhouses, and these were multiple,&lt;ref&gt;Shesgreen 27&lt;/ref&gt; the theaters calculatingly sought the highest appeal with the lowest cost.  If the cost of ''rehearsal'' time, in particular, could be shortened, the theater's investment would be reduced.  Rehearsal time cost a playhouse its cast, its property masters, and its stages, and a long rehearsal meant fewer plays put on.  Additionally, dramatists received the money from each third night of box office, and this could be dangerous to a house that needed every farthing to defray costs.  Star dramatists could negotiate for more than one benefit night and might have terms for benefits on revival, while new, unknown, or dependent authors could be managed.  The solution for the theatrical producers was to cut the costs of plays and actors while increasing the outright spectacle, and there were quite a few plays that were not literary at all that were staged more often than the literary plays.
[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|200px|A print by [[William Hogarth]] entitled ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' from 1724 depicting the managers of [[Drury Lane]] ([[Robert Wilks]], [[Colley Cibber]], and [[Barton Booth]]) rehearsing a play consisting of nothing but special effects, while they used the scripts for ''The Way of the World'', ''inter al.'', for toilet paper.  This battle of effects was a common subject of satire for the literary wits, including [[Alexander Pope|Pope]].]]

[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] and [[Colley Cibber]] dueled over special theatrical effects.  They put on plays that were actually just spectacles, where the text of the play was almost an afterthought.  Dragons, whirlwinds, thunder, ocean waves, and even actual elephants were on stage.  Battles, explosions, and horses were put on the boards (Cibber).  Rich specialized in [[pantomime]] and was famous as the character "Lun" in [[harlequin]] presentations.  The playwrights of these works were hired men, not dramatists, and so they did not receive the traditional third-night author's profits.  A pantomime, after all, required very little in the way of a playwright and much more in the way of a director, and with John Rich and Colley Cibber both acting as star players and directors, such on-demand spectacles did not necessitate a poet.  Further, spectacles could be written quickly to answer to the public's whims or the rival theater's triumphs, rarely risked offensive political statements, and did not require paying benefits to a playwright.  In other words, they gave the managers more profit.  The plays put on in this manner are not generally preserved or studied, but their near monopoly on the theaters, particularly in the 1720s, infuriated established literary authors.  Alexander Pope was only one of the poets to attack "spectacle" (in the 1727 ''[[Dunciad|Dunciad A]]'' and, with more vigor, the ''Dunciad B'').  The criticism was so widespread that Colley Cibber himself made excuses for his part in the special-effects war, claiming that he had no choice but to comply with market pressures.

===The "chromatic tortures" and divas of opera===
If vacant, subliterary spectacles were not enough of a threat to dramatists, [[opera]], which had crossed over to England in the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]], experienced an enormous surge in popularity with [[Italian opera|Italian]] [[grand opera]] in England in the 1710s and 1720s.  In ''[[The Spectator]]'', both in number 18 and the 3 April 1711 number, and many places elsewhere, [[Joseph Addison]] fretted that foreign opera would drive English drama from the stage altogether. These early fears followed the sudden rage for the Italian singers and operas that took over London in 1711 with the arrival of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].  Inasmuch as opera combined singing with acting, it was a mixed genre, and its violation of [[neo-classicism|neoclassical]] strictures had made it a controversial form from the start.  Addison, damning opera's heterogeny, wrote, "Our Countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a Lover chanting out a Billet-doux, and even the Superscription of a Letter set to a Tune."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Joseph ; Steele, Richard. "The Spectator", 1853. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of opera not only took up theatrical rehearsal time and space, it also took away dramatic subject matter.  Straight playwrights were at a loss.  As John Gay lamented (see below), no one could use music in a play unless it was as an opera, and Englishmen were nearly forbidden from that.  To add insult to injury, the casts and celebrated stars were foreigners and, as with [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]] (the latter of whom was paid two thousand pounds for a single season in 1721), [[castrati]].  Castrati were symbols, to the English, of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The satirists saw in opera the ''non plus ultra'' of invidiousness.  High melodies would cover the singers' expressions of grief or joy, conflating all emotion and sense under a tune that might be entirely unrelated.  [[Alexander Pope]] blasted this shattering of "decorum" and "sense" in ''Dunciad B'' and suggested that its real purpose was to awaken the Roman Catholic Church's power ("Wake the dull Church") while it put a stop to the political and satirical stage and made all Londoners fall into the sleep of un-Enlightenment:

:::Joy to Chaos! let Division reign:
:::Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them [the muses] hence,
:::Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense:
:::One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage,
:::Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;
:::To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,
:::And all thy yawning daughters cry, ''encore.'' (IV 55–60)

[[Image:Dukes-theater-1671.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1875 [[postcard]] from the [[Victoria and Albert Hall]] showing the Duke's Company theatre in [[Dorset Gardens]] (the so-called "machine house") in operation from 1671 to 1709, which began as a playhouse and gradually became a house for [[spectacle]].]]
Furthermore, grand opera had a high degree of spectacle in it.  In the 17th century, when opera first came to England, it prompted enormously complex theatrical stagings to present illusions of [[ghost]]s, mythological figures, and epic battles.  When Handel's arrival in England spurred a new vogue for English opera, it also caused a new vogue for imported opera, no matter the content, so long as it would create an enormous visual impact.  Although some of the "Tory Wits" like Pope and [[John Gay]] wrote opera [[libretto]]s (the two combining for ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' with Handel), opera was a spectacular form of theater that left too little room for dramatic acting for most of the playwrights.  Pope argued in ''The Dunciad'' that Handel's operas were "masculine" in comparison to Italian and French opera.  While this is a musical commentary, it is also a commentary on the amount of decoration and frippery put on the stage, on the way that Handel's operas concentrated on their stories and music rather than their theatrical effects.

It was not merely the fact that such operas drove out original drama, but also that the antics and vogue for the singers took away all else, seemingly, that infuriated English authors.  The singers (particularly the [[soprano]]s) introduced London to the concept of the [[prima donna]], in both senses of the term.  In 1727, two Italian sopranos, [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Faustina Bordoni]], had such a rivalry and hatred of each other (the latter had been paid more than the former) that the audiences were encouraged to support their favorite singer by hissing her rival, and during a performance of ''Astyanax'' in 1727, the two women actually began to fight on stage (Loughrey 13).  John Gay wrote to [[Jonathan Swift]] on 3 February 1723:
 
::There's nobody allow'd to say I sing but an Eunuch or an Italian Woman. Every body is grown now as great a judge of Musick as they were in your time of Poetry &amp; folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute over different Styles of Handel, [[Bononcini]], and [[Aitillio]].  People have now forgot [[Homer]], and [[Virgil]] &amp; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].

These operas were spectaculars in every sense.  The personalities of the stars were before the stage, the stars were before the music, and the music before the words.  Additionally, opera brought with it new stage machines and effects.  Even Handel, whom Pope values as restrained and sober, had his heroine brought on stage by "two huge Dragons out of whose mouths issue Fire and Smoke" in ''Rinaldo'' in 1711.

The "problem" of spectacle continued in the 1720s and 1730s.  In 1734, [[Henry Fielding]] has his tragedian, [[Fustian]], describe the horror of a pantomime show:

::intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of Shakespeare, Jonson, [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]], and others, they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes, of which the master of the playhouse, two or three painters, and half a score dancing-masters are the compilers.  ...I have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding, after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius, to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another, without speaking one syllable, and playing several juggling tricks, which are done at Fawks's after a much better manner; and for this, sir, the town does not only pay additional prices, but loses several fine parts of its best authors, which are cut out to make room for the said farces.  (''[[Pasquin]]'', V i.)

Fustian complains as well that authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors.  As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months trying to get a manager's attention and then "he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime" (''Pasquin'' IV i.).

==The reemergence of satirical drama, and the Licensing Act==
Toward the end of the 1720s, the behavior of opera stars, the absurdity of spectacle productions, and an escalation of political warfare between the two parties led to a reclamation of the stage by political dramatists.  During the later years of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who favored Robert Walpole, there was a scramble for the favor of the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], his wife, and his mistress, and this combined with a shattering of public confidence in the government after the [[South Sea Bubble]] and revelations of corruption in the trial of [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Charles Hitchen]], the Earl of Macclesfield, and others.

===John Gay and comic inversion===
John Gay parodied the opera with his satirical ''[[The Beggar's Opera|Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728) and with it delivered a [[satire]] of [[Robert Walpole]]'s actions during the [[South Sea Bubble]].  Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who runs a gang for a criminal fence named Peachum, whose daughter, Polly Peachum, is in love with him, and who escapes prison over and over again because the daughter of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is also in love with him.  Peachum wishes to see Macheath hanged because Polly has married Macheath, unlike Lucy Lockitt, who is merely pregnant by him (and neither woman is concerned with Macheath's sexual activity, but only with whom he marries, for marriage means access to his estate when he is eventually hanged).  Peachum fears that Macheath will turn him in to the law, and he also feels that marriage is a betrayal of good breeding, that prostitution is the genteel thing.  Gay announced his intention to create the "[[ballad opera]]" with the play.  The music for the songs came from tunes already popular, and ten of the tunes were from the satirist [[Tom D'Urfey]], whose ''Pills to Purge Melancholy'' was a collection of coarse, bawdy, and amusing songs on various topics.  The [[ballad]] was associated with [[folk song]]s and folk poetry, and so Gay's choice of using ballads (although ballads written by a well-known author) for his music was itself an attempt to deflate the seeming pomposity and elitism of the opera.

For most of the audience, the central entertainment of the opera was the [[love triangle]] between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy, but satirically, the centre of the opera was the Peachum/Macheath story.  This story was an obvious parallel with the case of [[Jonathan Wild]] (Peachum) and [[Jack Sheppard]] (Macheath).  However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath).  Robert Walpole was one of the most divisive ministers in British history, and his control of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ran for over two decades.  Until [[Margaret Thatcher]], no other [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (the office would not exist in name until later) had as adversarial a relationship with authors, and he had ruthlessly consolidated power and jealously guarded it against all threats.  During the South Sea Bubble, Walpole was accused of being "the screen," protecting the moneyed directors of the corporation from prosecution and of cashing in his own shares for full value before the collapse of the stock.  Further, during the life and career of the actual Jonathan Wild, Walpole's Whig ministry was suspected of protecting and supporting the master "thief-taker."

Additionally, Gay's opera was a strict [[parody]] and inversion of the opera.  Gay has his thieves and prostitutes speak like upper-class gentlemen and ladies.  Implicitly, he suggests that the nobles are no better than the thieves even as he suggests that thieves have their own mock-monarchies, senates, and religion.  He has his Beggar (the putative author of the opera) explain that the two female leads have equal parts and therefore should not fight (a joke that witnesses of the diva battle would understand).  The supernaturally lofty settings of opera are, in Gay's hands, the warrens of [[St Giles]] parish.  For palace settings, he has prisons.  For throne rooms, he has taverns.  For kings, he has criminal fences.  For [[knight errant|knights errant]]/[[pastoral poetry|shepherd lovers]], he has a highwayman.  For goddesses drawn about on gilded chariots, he has a ruined maid, a chorus of prostitutes, and Polly (who is perversely chaste).  The [[aria]]s also use the same metaphors that were common in opera, and Gay's songs are themselves parodies of the predictable lyrics in opera.  In each case, high and low trade places and Gay's suggestion of an essential likeness of the ministry with its most famous thief extended also to a suggestion that high opera is essentially like tavern songs and rounds.  The play was a hit, running for an unheard-of eighty performances.  Subsequently, the songs, as well as the play, were printed up and sold.

Robert Walpole, who had some personal animosity to John Gay, attended the play and enjoyed it.  However, upon learning from a friend that he was one of the targets of the satire, he tried to have the play stopped.  When Gay wrote a follow-up called ''Polly,'' Walpole had the play suppressed before performance.  The suppression was without precedent, although it was soon to be used ''as'' a precedent, for there had been no actual attack on the ministry.  The anti-ministerial (Tory) sentiment was entirely derived from interpretation.

Playwrights were therefore in straits.  On the one hand, when the playhouses were not running operas imported wholesale from the continent, they were dispensing with dramatists by turning out hack-written pantomimes.  On the other hand, when a satirical play appeared from a literary source, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry suppressed it even though it came from the most popular dramatist of the day (i.e., John Gay).  Furthermore, the grounds of the suppression were all implicit comparisons, and nothing explicit.  Gay had not ''said'' that Walpole was a crook as bad as Wild, although he had suggested it.

===The new Tory wits, escalating satire, and the creation of the Licensing Act===
[[File:Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Magnificent History of Tom Thumb the Great (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece to Fielding's ''Tom Thumb'', a play satirizing plays (and [[Robert Walpole]])]]
Robert Walpole's personal involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned the flames of the antagonism between himself and the stage.  [[Henry Fielding]], among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of ''Polly''.  Fielding's ''[[Tom Thumb]]'' (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks.  It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as "the Great Man" and his supposed control over [[Caroline of Ansbach]].  As with Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover.  The contrast between reality, delusion, and self-delusion was a form of [[bathos]] that made the audience think of other grand-speaking and grandly spoken of people.  If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadocio, might other great leaders be similarly small?  Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb?  Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the [[prime minister]] no greatness.  Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play.  Fielding was a [[justice of the peace]] by profession, and so he knew that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication.  Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form.  It was written by "Scribblerus Secundus," its title page announced (a reference to the [[Scriblerus Club]] of [[Jonathan Swift]], Gay, Pope, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]]), and it was the ''Tragedy of Tragedies,'' which did for drama what Pope's ''Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' had done for verse.  Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the [[parody|parodies]], and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister.  (Fielding's later novel, ''[[Jonathan Wild]]'', makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, "the Great Man," to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.)

Henry Fielding was not done with ministry satire.  His ''Covent-Garden Tragedy'' of 1732 was set in a [[brothel]] amongst the prostitutes.  Although the play was only acted once, it, like ''Tom Thumb,'' sold when printed.  Its attacks on ''[[poetic license]]'' and the antirealism of domestic tragedians and morally sententious authors was an attack on the values central to the Whig version of personal worth.  Two years later, Fielding was joined by [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] in anti-Walpolean satire.  His ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' takes its cue from ''Tom Thumb'' by outwardly satirizing the emptiness of bombast.  However, it also encoded a very specific and dangerous satire of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and his statutory wife.  The king and queen never meet in the play, and the subject is the former's wars with personal discomfort and the latter's desire for adultery.  In particular, the Queen herself is implicitly attacked.  However, the play also appears to be a superficial work of fancy and nonsense verse, and it delighted audiences with tongue twisters and parody.  However, Carey worked ''[[The Dragon of Wantley]]'' into a play in 1734.  Fielding and Carey, among others, picked up the cudgels where the Tory Wits had set them down and began to satirize Walpole and [[Parliament]] with increasing ferocity (and scatology).  Although a particular play of unknown authorship entitled ''A Vision of the Golden Rump'' was cited when Parliament passed the Licensing Act of 1737 (the "rump" being [[Parliament]], a rump roast, and human buttocks simultaneously), Carey's ''Dragon of Wantley'' was an unmistakable attack on tax policy and the ever-increasing power of the London government over the countryside.  Notably, Fielding's and Carey's plays made allowances for spectacle.  Indeed, their plays relied upon a [[burlesque]] of spectacle and by spectacle, for the effects of TopsyTurvy armies in ''Chrononhotonthologos'' (stacked atop each other instead of in ranks) and the titular dragon of Wantley, as well as the miniaturizing of Tom Thumb and the lurid scenery of the Covent Garden brothel, were part of the draw and part of the humor for these plays.

The Licensing Act required all plays to go to a censor before staging, and only those plays passed by the censor were allowed to be performed.  Therefore, plays were judged by ''potential'' criticism of the ministry and not just by reaction or performance.  The first play to be banned by the new Act was ''Gustavus Vasa'' by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]].  The play invoked the [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[Protestant]] king [[Gustav Vasa]] to castigate the purportedly corrupt Parliament of Walpole's administration, although Brooke would claim that he meant only to write a history play.  [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote a Swiftian parodic satire of the licensers, entitled ''A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage'' (1739).  The satire was, of course, not a vindication at all but rather a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the position for censorship.  Had the licensers not exercised their authority in a partisan manner, the Act might not have chilled the stage so dramatically, but the public was well aware of the bannings and [[censorship]], and consequently any play that ''did'' pass the licensers was regarded with suspicion by the public.  Therefore, the playhouses had little choice but to present old plays and pantomime and plays that had no conceivable political content.  One consequence was that [[William Shakespeare]]'s reputation grew enormously as his plays saw a quadrupling of performances, and sentimental comedy and melodrama were the only "safe" choices for new drama.  Dramatists themselves had to turn to prose or to less obvious forms of criticism, such as [[puppet]] shows that [[Charlotte Charke]] would invest in.

==Effects of the Licensing Act==
[[Image:Othello-tragedy-18th.gif|thumb|right|200px|Othello "strikes" Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]'' from the 1744 Thomas Hanmer deluxe edition of [[William Shakespeare]].  Hanmer's was one of the "improved" editions that was roundly hissed by textual critics.]]
In comedy, one effect of the Licensing Act was that playwrights began to develop a comedy of sentiment.  This comedy was critically labeled as "high" comedy, in that it was intended to be entertaining rather than actually be funny, and brought about its entertainment by elevating the sentiments of the viewer.  The plots also relied upon characters being in or out of sympathy with each other.  Very late in the 17th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] attempted to resist the tide of sentimental comedy with ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] would mount several satirical plays after Walpole's death. Both of these playwrights were taking advantage of a loosening of the censorship and popular weariness with "refined" comedy. Goldsmith's play reintroduces the country bumpkin character who outwits the sophisticated would-be rakes who are engaged in a plot to marry well. Sheridan, on the other hand, very consciously turned back to the [[Restoration comedy]]  for his models but carefully toned down the dangers of the sexual plots.

As mentioned above, another effect of the Licensing Act was to send the playhouses to old plays. Since any play written before 1737 could be staged without permission, theaters had a great deal to choose from.  However, they sought out Shakespeare, in particular, as the one author whose name alone could generate an audience as large as those formerly provided by leading poets.  Shakespeare's stature had been rising throughout the 18th century, and [[textual criticism]], particularly of Shakespeare, had resulted in reliable texts (''see [[Shakespeare's reputation]] for details''). Further, many of the expurgated and "improved" versions of Shakespeare were falling from favor.  Actors such as [[David Garrick]] made their entire reputations by playing Shakespeare.  The Licensing Act may be the single greatest factor in the rise of "[[Bardolatry]]."  However, other, less sparkling, plays were also revived, including multiple versions of ''Lady Jane Grey'' and ''The Earl of Essex'' (including one by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] that had been written before the Act).  Each of these could be used as a tacit commentary on the politics of the contemporary court and as a political gesture. Therefore, when playhouses wished to answer the public's political sentiment, they could quickly mount a performance of ''Cato'' or one of the Lady Jane Greys or, if the mood was otherwise, one of [[Aphra Behn]]'s royalist plays, and some of the Restoration plays such as [[William Wycherly]]'s ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' were always promising comedy.  However, when they needed to fill the house reliably, regardless of political season, and show off their actors, they staged Shakespeare.

[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[David Garrick]], a celebrity actor, starring as King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in [[Colley Cibber]]'s revision of Shakespeare's play six years after the Licensing Act]]
Finally, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were ''de rigueur'' for authors who were not journalists. This had to do with the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or ''Collected Sermons,'' and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make.  (For example, Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his ''Poems on Various Occasions'', which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists ([[Daniel Defoe]]), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was [[Aphra Behn]], who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her ''[[Oroonoko]]'' seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', was inappropriate for the stage.  However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.

Additionally, prior to 1737 the economic motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take of the third night of a play. This could be a very large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, [[John Gay]] grew wealthy with ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. In 1726, [[Leonard Welsted]]'s indifferent success, ''The Dissembled Woman'', was acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights.  After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, [[Samuel Richardson|Samuel Richardson's]] ''[[Clarissa]]'' was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more.  From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act.  Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.

Also known as the '''Bechdel–Wallace test''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alison Bechdel Would Like You to Call It the "Bechdel–Wallace Test," ThankYouVeryMuch|url=http://www.themarysue.com/bechdel-wallace-test-please-alison-bechdel/|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the American cartoonist [[Alison Bechdel]], in whose comic strip, ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'', the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of [[Virginia Woolf]]. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.

==History==

===Gender portrayal in popular fiction===
[[File:Female and male characters in film.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Female and male characters in film, according to four studies]]
In her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechdel-Test: Frauen spielen keine Rolle|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All these relationships between women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of fictitious women, are too simple. ... And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends. ... They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until [[Jane Austen]]'s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman's life is that ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|title=A Room of One's Own: Chapter 5|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/complete.html|work=[[University of Adelaide#North Terrace|The University of Adelaide Library]]|publisher=[[University of Adelaide Press]]|accessdate=24 December 2012|authorlink=Virginia Woolf|editor=Thomas, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleakley | first1 = A. | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = P.

According to a 2014 study by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sakoui|first1=Anousha|last2=Magnusson|first2=Niklas|title='Hunger Games' success masks stubborn gender gap in Hollywood|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=22 September 2014}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|title=Gender Bias Without Borders: An Investigation of Female Characters in Popular Films Across 11 Countries|url=http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|website=See Jane|accessdate=16 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|last4=Gillig|first4=Traci|last5=Lee|first5=Carmen|last6=Dylan|first6=DeLuca|title=Inequality in 700 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race,  &amp; LGBT Status from 2007 to 2014|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 analysis of [[screenplay]]s of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=The problem with almost all movies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|work=The Washington Post|date=12 April 2016|language=en-US}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hanah|last2=Daniels|first2=Matt|title=The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever|url=http://polygraph.cool/films/|website=Polygraph|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bechdel test===
[[File:Dykes to Watch Out For (Bechdel test origin).jpg|400px|thumb|A character in ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' explains the rules that later came to be known as the Bechdel test (1985)]]
The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip ''[[Dykes To Watch Out For]]''. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger,&lt;ref name="Martindale"/&gt; discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
# The movie has to have at least two women in it,
# who talk to each other,
# about something besides a man.&lt;ref&gt;Bechdel, Allison. Dykes to Watch Out For. Firebrand Books (October 1, 1986). {{ISBN|978-0932379177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/zizyphus/34585797/in/photostream/ "The Rule" comic page posted on Alison Bechdel's online photostream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alisonbechdel.blogspot.com/2005/08/rule.html|title=The Rule|author=Alison Bechdel|date=August 16, 2005|publisher=DTWOF: The Blog|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other woman acknowledges that the idea is pretty strict, but good. Not finding any films that meet their requirements, they go home together.&lt;ref name="Martindale"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martindale|first1=Kathleen|title=Un/Popular Culture: Lesbian Writing After the Sex Wars|date=1997|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791432890|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UO8kUNqHhgQC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has also been referred to as the "Bechdel–Wallace test"&lt;ref name="sparqling" /&gt; (which Bechdel herself prefers),&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Fresh Air]] program on NPR on August 17, 2015, in response to a question from host Terry Gross, Bechdel said she would prefer the test be referred to as the Bechdel–Wallace Test.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Bechdel rule",&lt;ref name="ok" /&gt; "Bechdel's law",&lt;ref name="antipope" /&gt; or the "Mo Movie Measure".&lt;ref name=AB/&gt; Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and [[karate]] training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] of the strip.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94202522 NPR] [[Neda Ulaby|Ulaby, Neda]] "The 'Bechdel Rule,' Defining Pop-Culture Character".

Originally meant as "a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper", according to Bechdel,&lt;ref name="San Diego City Beat 23 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morlan|first1=Kinsee|title=Comic-Con vs. the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|accessdate=15 August 2014|work=[[San Diego City Beat]]|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316161800/http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the test moved into mainstream criticism in the 2010s and has been described as "the standard by which feminist critics judge television, movies, books, and other media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Kay|editor-first=James|editor-last=Lowder|title=Triumph of The Walking Dead|chapter=No Clean Slate: Unshakeable race and gender politics in ''The Walking Dead''|year=2011|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|isbn=9781936661138|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz3fp1fVw90C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an Internet newspaper described it as "almost a household phrase, common shorthand to capture whether a film is woman-friendly".&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot 18 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Aja|title=The Mako Mori Test: 'Pacific Rim' inspires a Bechdel Test alternative|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of major Hollywood productions such as ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' (2013) to pass the test was addressed in depth in the media.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGuinness|first=Ross|title=The Bechdel test and why Hollywood is a man's, man's, man's world|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/07/18/movie-lovers-hit-back-at-hollywood-misogyny-with-the-bechdel-test-3886103/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neda Ulaby]], the test resonates because "it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a "commentary on how media representations enforce harmful [[gender norm]]s" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dean |last1=Spade|first2=Craig |last2=Willse|editor-last=Hawkesworth|editor-first=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199328581|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters,&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"/&gt; or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |title=The Oscars and the Bechdel Test |publisher=Feminist Frequency |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf Bechdel Test academic paper.]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suh |first1=Haley |title=Words To Know By Now: Binge-Watching, Bechdel Test Added To Oxford English Dictionary |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=15 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in the film industry===
In 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel [[Viasat Film]] incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the [[Swedish Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias |title=Swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias with Bechdel test rating |work=The Guardian |date=November 6, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European cinema fund [[Eurimages]] incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires "a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender equality within Eurimages: current situation and scope for evolution|url=http://www.ewawomen.com/en/eurimages-news.html|website=European Women's Audiovisual Network|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[screenwriting software]] developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes [[Highland 2]], [[WriterDuet]] and the forthcoming [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]] 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryzik |first1=Melena |title=Is your script gender-balanced?

==Application==

In addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Kishonna|title=Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live: Theoretical Perspectives from the Virtual Margins|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317521803|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh-gBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anthropy |first=Anna |title=Rise of the videogame zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an art form |year=2012 |publisher=Seven Stories Press |isbn=9781609803735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc3GRXqgPZ8C&amp;lpg=PT7 |edition=Seven Stories Press 1st |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Agnello |first=Anthony John |title=Something other than a man: 15 games that pass the Bechdel Test |url=http://gameological.com/2012/07/something-other-than-a-man-15-games-that-pass-the-bechdel-test/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |work=Gameological |date=July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comics.&lt;ref name="MTV Geek! 22 February 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zalben |first=Alex |title=''Witchblade''/''Red Sonja #1'' Passes The Bechdel Test |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/02/22/witchbladered-sonja-1-passes-the-bechdel-test-advance-review/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[MTV Geek!]] |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a "Bechdel Theatre" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jo Caird|title = Does your show pass the Bechdel test? {{!}} Opinion |url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2015/does-your-show-pass-the-bechdel-test/|website = The Stage|date=14 October 2015|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pass and fail proportions===
The website ''bechdeltest.com'' is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be ''named'' characters. {{as of|April 2015}}, it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |url=http://bechdeltest.com/statistics/ |work=bechdeltest.com |accessdate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nominees.&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=I Am Woman. Hear Me... Please! |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20408121,00.html |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news website ''[[Vocativ]]'', when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Sharma |first1= Versha |last2= Sender |first2= Hanna |title= Hollywood Movies With Strong Female Roles Make More Money |url= http://www.vocativ.com/culture/celebrity/hollywood-movies-strong-female-roles-make-money/ |accessdate= 2 January 2014 |newspaper= Vocativ |date= 2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Charles Stross]] noted that about half of the films that ''do'' pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies.&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Nina |title=One-dimensional woman |year=2009 |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=1846942411 |pages=39 et seq. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3gDWJEJblEC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: "How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!"&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

===Financial aspects===
''Vocativ''{{'}}s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to "put more women onscreen."&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"/&gt; A 2014 study by [[FiveThirtyEight]] based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the [[median]] budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher [[return on investment]] (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.&lt;ref name="538 2014"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= FiveThirtyEight |first= Walt |last= Hickey |title= The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women |date= 1 April 2014 |url= http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanations===
Explanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among scriptwriters&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; and other movie professionals, also called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[National Review]]'' in 2017, film critic [[Kyle Smith]] suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that "Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men", and that such films were more often created by men because "women's movie ideas", mostly about relationships according to Smith, "aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios".&lt;ref name="Smith 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|title=If You Like Art, Don’t Take the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=National Review|date=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith 2017" /&gt; Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Conservative Film Critic Slammed for Bechdel Test Takedown|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[EW.com]]|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate "big movie ideas", citing [[J.

== Limitations ==
The Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test.&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |first=Sarah |last=Wilson |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |title=Bechdel Rule still applies to portrayal of women in films}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', set in a medieval monastery).&lt;ref name="antipope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Bechdel's Law|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|work=Charlie's Diary|date=28 July 2008|authorlink=Charles Stross|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] song "[[Baby Got Back]]" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a [[valley girl]] saying "oh my god, Becky, look at her butt")&lt;ref name=LifehackerDouglas&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test, and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained], by Nick Douglas, at ''[[Lifehacker]]''; published October 10, 2017; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JezebelSimulator&gt;[https://jezebel.com/this-bechdel-test-simulator-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-pre-1753250185 This Bechdel Test Simulator Shows How Easy It Is to Predict Who Makes Sexist Movies (Men)], by Kara Brown, at ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''; published January 15, 2016; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez Maureira |first1=M.A.|last2=Rombout|first2=L.E.|editor1-last=Chorianopoulos|editor1-first=Konstantinos|title=Entertainment Computing - ICEC 2015: 14th International Conference, ICEC 2015, Trondheim, Norway, September 29 - October 2, 2015, Proceedings|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245898|page=546|chapter=Sonifying Gender Representation in Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt at a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.&lt;ref name="sparqling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Faith|title=SPARQLing Conversation: Automating The Bechdel–Wallace Test|url=http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|date=June 2011|work=Paper presented at the Narrative and Hypertext Workshop, Hypertext 2011|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a "nefarious plot to make all movies conform to [[feminist]] dogma".&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl¨, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement|date=2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395892|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andi Zeisler]], this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility "has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer." Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is "feminist" might lead to creators "gaming the system" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.

Similarly, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' film critic [[Robbie Collin]] disapproved of the test as prizing "box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Bechdel test is damaging to the way we think about film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, "it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on".&lt;ref name="538 2014" /&gt;

[[Nina Power]] wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be "realistic" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.&lt;ref name="Power 2009" /&gt;

The "Sphinx test" by the Sphinx theater company of London asks about the interaction of women with other characters, as well as how prominently women characters feature in the action, how proactive rather than reactive they are, and whether they are portrayed stereotypically. It was conceived to "encourage theatremakers to think about how to write more and better roles for women", in reaction to research indicating that only 37% of theater roles were written for women {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snow|first1=Georgia|title=Theatre gets its own Bechdel Test|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/theatre-gets-its-own-bechdel-test/|accessdate=6 December 2015|work=[[The Stage]]|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about characteristics other than gender===

====Sexuality====
The "[[Vito Russo]] test" created by the [[LGBT]] organization [[GLAAD]] tests for the representation of LGBT characters in films. It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GLAAD introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index', report on LGBT images in films released by 'Big Six' studios |url=http://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six |date=August 20, 2013 |publisher=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 21 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=John|first=Arit|title=Beyond the Bechdel Test: Two (New) Ways of Looking at Movies|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/08/beyond-bechdel-test-two-new-ways-looking-movies/68563/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People of color====
A test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are [[people of color]], who talk to each other without mentioning their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawn|first1=Randee|title=Gender and race issues are slowly fading as more filmmakers consider three key tests|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-1117-film-tests-20161011-snap-20161109-story.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] suggested in January 2016 the "DuVernay test", (named for director [[Ava DuVernay]]) asking whether "African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like ‘The Birth of a Nation’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to point out the lack of people of color in [[Hollywood]] [[movie]]s, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.&lt;ref name="2016-02-01_TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|title=Could This Be the Bechdel Test for Race|accessdate=February 4, 2018|last=Evans|first=Dayna|date=February 1, 2016|work=The Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia Latif and Leila Latif of ''[[The Guardian]]'' have suggested a series of five questions:
* Are there two named characters of color?
* Do they have dialogue?
* Are they not romantically involved with one another?
* Do they have any dialogue that isn't comforting or supporting a white character?
* Is one of them definitely not [[Magical Negro|magic]]?&lt;ref name="2016-01-19_NL-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|title=How to fix Hollywood's race problem|accessdate=June 20, 2017|last1=Latif|last2=Latif|first1=Nadia|first2=Leila|date=January 18, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if "two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla|first=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=November 22, 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about nonfiction===
The Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[npm (software)|npm]], proposed a Bechdel test for software. [[Source code]] passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=seldo |author=Laurie Voss |number=571453200093437952 |date=27 Feb 2015 |title=Does your project pass the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test also inspired the [[Finkbeiner test]], a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about [[women in science]].&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brainard |first=Curtis |title='The Finkbeiner Test' Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all |accessdate=31 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=22 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bird in Space''''' (''L'Oiseau dans l'espace'') is a series of sculptures by [[Romania]]n sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The original work was created in 1928. It was sold in 2005 for $27.5 million, at the time [[List of most expensive sculptures|a record price]] for a sculpture sold in an auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW-2005-05-10-12-15-39p1.htm Brâncuși's "Bird in Space" Sets World Auction Record for Sculpture at $27,456,000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124121428/http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW-2005-05-10-12-15-39p1.htm |date=January 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crib.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=15441&amp;arhiva=true The price record for a Brâncuși masterpiece was set up in 2005 when “Bird in Space” was sold for USD 27.5 M] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514223741/http://crib.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=15441&amp;arhiva=true |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original title in Romanian is '''''Pasărea în văzduh'''''.

==Description==

In the ''Bird in Space'' works, Brâncuși concentrated not on the physical attributes of the bird, but instead on its movement. The bird's wings and feathers are eliminated, the swell of the body is elongated, and the head and beak are reduced to a slanted oval plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab Met description] of ''Bird in Space'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925072110/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the sculptures in the series are made of [[marble]], while the other nine were cast in [[bronze]]. The first and best known of the series is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], while two bronze casts (1928 and c.1941) reside in that city's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Two versions of the sculpture, one bronze (1924) and one marble (1923–1924), are housed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is home to a marble and a bronze from 1925 and 1927, respectively. A 1926 bronze is held by the [[Seattle Art Museum]] but is currently not on display. Two more bronze casts (1925–1926 and 1927) are on display at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and a 1931 bronze cast is housed at the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]] in Pasadena, California. Another bronze of unknown casting date resides in the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice, Italy, and the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in Canberra owns two marbles, both c.1931-1936, one white and one black.

==Legal Controversy==

In 1926-27, ''Bird in Space'' was the subject of a court battle over its taxation by [[U.S. Customs]]. In October 1926, ''Bird in Space'', along with 19 other Brâncuși sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship ''Paris''.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2002/story_giry_sepoct2002.msp|title=Legal Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731160,00.html|title=Art: Bird|date=31 October 1927|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). [[Marcel Duchamp]] (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer [[Edward Steichen]] (who was to take possession of ''Bird in Space'' after exhibition), and Brâncuși himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the [[Brummer Gallery]] in New York City and then the [[Arts Club of Chicago|Arts Club]] in Chicago.  Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under "Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies") until a decision could be reached. However, customs appraiser F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the ''New York Evening Post'' that "several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government.... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Brâncuși's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Brâncuși left too much to the imagination."&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt; The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision.

Under the 1922 Tariff Act, for a sculpture to count as duty-free it must be an original work of art, with no practical purpose, made by a professional sculptor.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;  No one argued that the piece had a practical purpose, but whether or not the sculpture was art was hotly contested. The 1916 case ''United States v. Olivotti'' had established that sculptures were art only if they were carved or chiseled representations of natural objects "in their true proportions." Therefore, a series of artists and art experts testified for both the defense and the prosecution about the definition of art and who decides exactly what art is.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

Brâncuși's [[affidavit]] to the American Consulate explained the process of creating the piece, establishing its originality:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:I conceived it to be created in bronze and I made a plaster model of it. This I gave to the founder, together with the formula for the bronze alloy and other necessary indications. When the roughcast was delivered to me, I had to stop up the air holes and the core hole, to correct the various defects, and to polish the bronze with files and very fine emery. All this I did myself, by hand; this artistic finishing takes a very long time and is equivalent to beginning the whole work over again. I did not allow anybody else to do any of this finishing work, as the subject of the bronze was my own special creation and nobody but myself could have carried it out to my satisfaction.

Despite the varied opinions on what qualifies as art presented to the court, in November 1928 Judges Young and Waite found in favor of the artist. The decision drafted by Waite concluded:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:The object now under consideration . . . is beautiful and symmetrical in outline, and while some difficulty might be encountered in associating it with a bird, it is nevertheless pleasing to look at and highly ornamental, and as we hold under the evidence that it is the original production of a professional sculptor and is in fact a piece of sculpture and a work of art according to the authorities above referred to, we sustain the protest and find that it is entitled to free entry.

This was the first court decision that accepted that non-representational sculpture could be considered art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/martin/art_law/whatisart.htm|title=Art Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Bird in Space'' was the inspiration for a classical music composition by composer Timothy A. Corpus. This work was premiered at the architectural festival [[Open House Chicago]], in which the piece was performed throughout the festival at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2012/Fall-Culture-Guide-2012-Access-Contemporary-Music-Chicago-Architecture-Foundation-Team-Up/|title=Chicago Architecture Foundation, Classical Composers Team Up for Open House Chicago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American poet, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) refers to Brancusi's "Bird" in her poem, "Reading time: 1 minute 26 seconds" (1939) and uses this link to highlight the fear we have of embracing the new and non-utilitarian in the arts, and to encourage us to break through an unhealthy mind-set so that we may see the world anew: "... The climax when the brain acknowledges the world, / all values extended into the blood awake. / Moment of proof.  And as they say Brancusi did, / building his bird to extend through soaring air, / as Kafka planned stories that draw to eternity / through time extended.  And the climax strikes. ..." (from ''A Turning Wind'', 1939. Muriel Rukeyser).

'''''Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil''''' is  a public artwork by [[Poles|Polish]] sculptor [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]]. It is located on the Kilbourn Avenue boulevard in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. The 2001 [[aluminum]] sculpture consists six pieces organized in columns. The column heights are 4–6 meters, and the dimensions of the birds are: height 100–160&amp;nbsp;cm, width 190–260&amp;nbsp;cm, length 120–135&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Description==
''Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil'' is an aluminum sculpture located near E Kilbourn Ave &amp; N Cass St, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202. The sculpture faces toward [[Lake Michigan]]. It is also across from the Woman's Club of Wisconsin. It contains six separate pieces, each piece depicting a bird. Three of the birds have two wings and the other three birds have four wings. All of the bird's wings are at different angles. The six birds are arranged to mimic the ground they are set up on. Although the sculpture represents birds they are not depicted in full detail. Like many of Abakanowicz's sculptures ''Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil'' lack heads. When asked about her work Abakanowicz states, "perhaps the experience of the crowd, waiting passively in line, but ready to trample, destroy or afore on command like a headless creature, became the core of my analysis." Along with the bird's lack of heads their surface is that of an organic texture. This is juxtaposed with their aluminum material.

There is a plaque in the lawn where the public work is located. It reads:
&lt;center&gt;Magdalena Abakanowicz&lt;br&gt;
Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil. &lt;br&gt;
2001. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Commissioned by members of the Woman's Club of Wisconsin on the occasion of its 125th Anniversary.
Celebrating Milwaukee's tradition of community service 
The artist wishes to acknowledge the special assistance of [[:pl:Artur Starewicz|Artur Starewicz]], Warsaw Poland

'''Quotes by Abakanowicz'''

"I'm frightened by crowds of people, birds or even insects swarming in great masses.  People in an airport, people on a metro or on a tram, can seem threatening, horrible, a brainless entity.  Today we are pushed by quantity in general.  I create these crowds of figures as a warning: they're saying we are too many."&lt;ref name= quote&gt;[http://artfactorybialystok.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/female-artist-month-magdalena-abakanowicz/]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I feel overawed by quantity where counting no longer makes sense. By unrepeatability within such a quantity. By creatures of nature gathered in herds, droves, species, in which each individual, while subservient to the mass, retains some distinguishing features. A crowd of people, birds, insects, or leaves is a mysterious assemblage of variants of certain prototype. A riddle of nature's abhorrence of exact repetition or inability to produce it. Just as the human hand cannot repeat its own gesture, I invoke this disturbing law, switching my own immobile herds into that rhythm."&lt;ref name= quote /&gt;

'''Black is beautiful''' is a [[cultural movement]] that was started in the US in the 1960s by [[African American]]s. It later spread beyond the United States, most prominently in the writings of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] of [[Steve Biko]] in [[South Africa]].

It aims to dispel the racist notion that [[black people]]'s natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html Some notes on the BLACK CULTURAL MOVEMENT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220045250/http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html |date=December 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]] was long thought to be the first to coin the phrase "black is beautiful" — during a speech in 1858—but historical records indicate he never actually used the specific phrase on that day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Negro History'', [[Association for the Study of Negro Life and History]],Vol.54,No. 4 (Oct., 1969)pp. 405–406&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also encouraged men and women to stop trying to eliminate African-identified traits by [[straightening their hair]] and attempting to [[Skin whitening|lighten or bleach their skin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastafarispeaks.com/cgi-bin/forum/config.pl?noframes;read=79921 Jamaica Says Black Is Beautiful]&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement began in an effort to counteract the racist notion in [[American culture]] that features typical of Blacks were less attractive or desirable than those of Whites. Research indicates that the idea of blackness being ugly is highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderforum.uni-koeln.de/genderealisations/weedon.html Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective] by Chris Weedon, Cardiff University &lt;blockquote&gt;In her novel ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' (1970), [[Toni Morrison]] depicts the effects of the legacy of 19th century racism for poor black people in the United States. The novel tells of how the daughter of a poor black family, Pecola Breedlove, internalizes white standards of beauty to the point where she goes mad. Her fervent wish for blue eyes comes to stand for her wish to escape the poor, unloving, racist environment in which she lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This idea made its way into black communities themselves&lt;ref&gt;''"Black is Beautiful" and the Color Preferences of Afro-American Youth'' – Claud Anderson, Rue L. Cromwell, ''The Journal of Negro Education'', Vol. 46, No. 1 (Winter, 1977), pp. 76–88 {{doi|10.2307/2966874}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to practices such as [[Paper Bag Party|paper bag parties]]: social events which discriminated against dark-skinned African-Americans by only admitting lighter-skinned individuals.

==History==
While the Black is Beautiful movement started in the 1960s, this fight for equal rights and a positive perception of the [[African Americans|African American]] body starts much earlier in American history. The reason this moment took form was because the media and society as a whole had a negative perception of the African American body as suitable only for slave status.&lt;ref&gt;Cassandra Jackson, ''Violence, Visual Culture, and the Black Male Body'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Black is Beautiful movement was based around a fight for an equal perception of the black body to help undo all the negative ideas brought about by a history based in white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie M. H. Camp, "Black Is Beautiful: An American History." ''Journal of Southern History'' 81#3 (2015): 675+. [http://search.proquest.com/openview/9504cc0ef53aaa2eaa2b1f04187bf540/1?pq-origsite=gscholar online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proving that Black is Beautiful has bled into fashion, where the idea is that dressing with sophistication in mind allows for one to command automatic respect from those around them. This is best exemplified in Black Dandyism, a male fashion movement best described through Monica Miller's book ''Slaves to Fashion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.papermag.com/how-black-men-birthed-dandyism-the-street-style-movement-that-means-fa-2429257179.html |title= How Black Men Birthed Dandyism – the Street Style Movement That Means Far More Than Meets the Eye |first=Beatrice |last= Hazlehurst |date=July 1, 2017  |magazine=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since slaves were forbidden from wearing expensive or beautiful fabrics, dressing up the Black body has historically been a radical statement of self-hood and equality. Black Dandyism has morphed over the years, moving from simply dressing sharply in the fashion of the times to what is now the combination of dressing sharply and loud, African-inspired prints and colors that subvert notions of traditional masculinity.

'''Boris Smirnoff''' (1903 - 2007) was a [[France|Franco]]-[[Russia]]n [[Cubism|cubist]], [[Avant-gardism|avant-gardist]] and [[analytical art]] [[Painting|painter]].

Boris Smirnoff was born  in [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. He had two brothers - Alexander and Vladimir. He was the youngest son. Vladimir was known as the artist-[[amateur]] and the [[Futurism|futurist]], big admirer of [[David Burliuk]] and [[Vasily Kamensky]].

His family escaped to France in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]]. Boris behind them, and stayed in [[Petrograd]]. He is learning as artist and works in [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]] Theatre.

In 1926 Boris has found the new idol - [[Pavel Filonov]] with new "[[Analytical art|Analytical Art]]".

In 1927 Boris Smirnoff has appeared in France. He worked as a painter in France. Over the next decade, he drew a lot of [[oil painting]]s and [[pastel]]s.

All this oils and pastels were burned by the German invaders as "[[degenerate art]]" during the [[Second World War]].

Because of this Boris Smirnoff began to draw exclusively [[watercolour]] on paper after the war. He said: "I can always put these watercolours into a suitcase and to carry away with myself!"

Boris Smirnoff refused to sell his [[Work of art|artworks]] like his teacher Pavel Filonov.

After the [[Second World War]] Boris Smirnoff had lived in [[UK|Great Britain]] and [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]].

Many years later, Boris returned to Russia and saw that it was a different country. This was not the Russia, from which he left. And, even though the country largely did not like him, he remained there until his death.

Until his death, he did not sell his watercolours. He said: "One hundred and four years - this is not a reason to change my habits".

Boris Smirnoff died in Russia in 2007 at the age of 104. After his death the Boris Smirnoff Foundation was organised to manage his collection. Today, one of the key locations the public can see his art is at the [[The Vineyard Hotel|Vineyard Hotel]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]], England.

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine literature''' is the [[Greek literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]], whether written in the territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]] or outside its borders.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica - "Greek literature: Byzantine literature"&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the second period in the history of Greek literature after [[Ancient Greek literature]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although ''popular'' Byzantine literature and early [[Modern Greek literature]] both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek", [[E. M. Geldart]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Many of the classical Greek genres, such as drama and choral lyric poetry, had been obsolete by late antiquity, and all medieval literature in the [[Greek language]] was written in an archaizing style, which imitated the writers of [[ancient Greece]]. This practice was perpetuated by a long-established system of Greek education where [[rhetoric]] was a leading subject.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; A typical product of this Byzantine education was the Greek [[Church Fathers]], who shared the literary values of their pagan contemporaries. Consequently, the vast Christian literature of the 3rd to 6th centuries established a synthesis of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Christian]] thought. As a result, Byzantine literature was largely written in a style of [[Atticism|Atticistic]] Greek, far removed from the popular [[Medieval Greek]] that was spoken by all classes of Byzantine society in their everyday lives. In addition, this literary style was also removed from the [[Koine Greek]] language of the [[New Testament]], reaching back to [[Homer]] and the writers of ancient [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In this manner, the culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was marked for over 1000 years by a [[diglossia|diglossy]] between two different forms of the same language, which were used for different purposes.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, the relations between the "high" and "low" forms of Greek changed over the centuries. The prestige of the Attic literature remained undiminished until the 7th century AD, but in the following two centuries when the existence of the Byzantine Empire was threatened, city life and education declined, and along with them the use of the classicizing language and style. The political recovery of the 9th century instigated a literary revival, in which a conscious attempt was made to recreate the Hellenic-Christian literary culture of late antiquity.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Simple or popular Greek was avoided in literary use and many of the early saints' lives were rewritten in an archaizing style. By the 12th century the cultural confidence of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] led them to develop new literary genres, such as romantic fiction, in which adventure and love are the main elements.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Satire made occasional use of elements from spoken Greek. The period from the [[Fourth Crusade]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople]] saw a vigorous revival of imitative classicizing literature, as the Greeks sought to assert their cultural superiority over the militarily more powerful West.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; At the same time there was the beginning of a flourishing literature in an approximation to the vernacular [[Modern Greek]]. However the vernacular literature was limited to poetic romances and popular devotional writing. All serious literature continued to make use of the archaizing language of learned Greek tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Byzantine literature has two sources: [[ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Each of those sources provided a series of models and references for the Byzantine writer and his readers. In occasion, both sources were referred to side by side, for example when emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius Comnenus]] justified his actions of seizing church property to pay his soldiers by referring to the earlier examples of [[Pericles]] and the biblical king [[King David|David]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

=== Greek ===
The oldest of these three civilizations is the Greek, centered not in [[Athens]] but in [[Alexandria]] and Hellenistic civilization. Alexandria through this period is the center of both Atticizing scholarship and of Graeco-Judaic social life, looking towards Athens as well as towards [[Jerusalem]]. This intellectual dualism between the culture of scholars and that of the people permeates the Byzantine period. Even Hellenistic literature exhibits two distinct tendencies, one rationalistic and scholarly, the other romantic and popular: the former originated in the schools of the Alexandrian [[Sophism|sophists]] and culminated in the rhetorical romance, the latter rooted in the idyllic tendency of [[Theocritus]] and culminated in the idyllic novel. Both tendencies persisted in Byzantium, but the first, as the one officially recognized, retained predominance and was not driven from the field until the fall of the empire. The reactionary linguistic movement known as [[Atticism]] supported and enforced this scholarly tendency. Atticism prevailed from the 2nd century BC onward, controlling all subsequent Greek culture, so that the living form of the Greek language was obscured and only occasionally found expression in private documents and popular literature.

=== Roman ===
Alexandria, the intellectual center, is balanced by Rome, the center of government. It is as a Roman Empire that the Byzantine state first entered history; its citizens were known as Romans (''Rhomaioi''), its capital as New Rome (Constantinople). Its laws were Roman; so were its government, its army, and its official class, and at first also its language and its private and public life. The organization of the state was very similar to that of the Roman imperial period, including its hierarchy and bureaucratic elite.

=== Christian ===
It was in Alexandria that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

=== Oriental ===
Greek Christianity had of necessity a pronounced Oriental character; [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid Syria]] are the real birthplaces of the Graeco-Oriental church and Byzantine civilization in general. Egypt and Syria, with [[Asia Minor]], became for the autochthonous Greek civilization a place where hundreds of flourishing cities sprang into existence, where energies confined or crippled in the impoverished homeland found release; not only did these cities surpass in material wealth the mother country, but soon also cultivated the highest goods of the intellect ([[Karl Krumbacher|Krumbacher]]). Under such circumstances it is not strange that about nine-tenths of all the Byzantine authors of the first eight centuries were natives of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor.

== Genres ==
The following account classifies Byzantine literature into five groups. The first three include representatives of those kinds of literature which continued the ancient traditions: historians and [[chronicle]]rs, encyclopedists and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The other two include new literary genres, ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.

=== Historians and annalists ===
{{further information|Greek historiography|List of Greek historiographers}}
The two groups of secular prose literature show clearly the dual character of Byzantine intellectual life in its social, religious, and linguistic aspects. From this point of view historical and annalistic literature supplement each other; the former is aristocratic and secular, the latter ecclesiastical and monastic; the former is classical, the latter popular. The works of the historians belong to scholarly literature, those of the annalists (or chroniclers) to the literature of the people. The former are carefully elaborated, the latter give only raw material, the former confine themselves to the description of the present and the most recent past, and thus have rather the character of contemporary records; the latter cover the whole history of the world as known to the Middle Ages. The former are therefore the more valuable for political history; the latter for the history of civilization.

Classical literary tradition set the standard for Byzantine historians in their grasp of the aims of history, the manner of handling their subjects, and in style of composition. Their works are thoroughly concrete and objective in character, without passion, and even without enthusiasm. Ardent patriotism and personal convictions are rarely evident. They are diplomatic historians, expert in the use of historical sources and in the polished tact called for by their social position; they are not cIoset-scholars, ignorant of the world, but men who stood out in public life: jurists like [[Procopius]], [[Agathias]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], [[Michael Attaliates]], statesmen like [[John Kinnamos|Joannes Cinnamus]], [[Nicetas Acominatus]], [[Georgius Pachymeres]], [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]]; generals and diplomats like [[Nicephorus Bryennius the Younger]], [[George Acropolites]], [[Georgius Phrantzes]]; and even crowned heads, like [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], [[Anna Comnena]], [[John VI Cantacuzene]], and others. The Byzantine historians thus represent not only the social but also the intellectual flower of their time, resembling in this their Greek predecessors, [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Polybius]], who became their guides and models. Sometimes a Byzantine chooses a classic writer to imitate in method and style. The majority, however, took as models several authors, a custom which gave rise to a peculiar mosaic style, quite characteristic of the Byzantines. While often the result of a real community of feeling, it effectively prevented development of an individual style.

Had such a preëminent historian as Procopius modeled his work after Polybius rather than Thucydides, Byzantine histories may have followed a natural continuity in style and method with the Hellenic era. The Hellenistic "Atticists" however had impressed their tastes thoroughly on later centuries, celebrating the style of the Athenian golden age. It is no accident that military characters like Nicephorus Bryennius (11th and 12th centuries) and Joannes Cinnamus (12th century) emulated Xenophon in the precision of their diction, or that a philosopher like Nicephorus Gregoras (13th century) took [[Plato]] as his model. On the other hand, it is doubtless due to chance that writers trained in theology like [[Leo Diaconus]] and Georgius Pachymeres chose to emulate [[Homer]]ic turns. On the whole it is in the later historians that the dualism of Byzantine civilization—ecclesiastico-political matter in classical form—becomes most apparent.

While Byzantine historians were mostly dependent on foreign models, and seem to form a continuous series in which each succeeds the last, they do not blend into a uniform whole. Most of the historians come in either the period embracing the 6th and 7th centuries during the reigns of the East-Roman emperors, or that extending from the 11th to the 15th century under the [[Comneni]] and the [[Palaeologi]]. At its zenith under the [[Byzantine Empire#Golden era|Macedonian dynasty]] (the 9th and 10th centuries) the Byzantine world produced great heroes, but no great historians, excepting the solitary figure of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]].

The first period is dominated by Procopius because of his subject matter and his literary importance. Typically Byzantine, his ''[[Anekdota]]'' depreciates Emperor [[Justinian I]] as emphatically as his ''[[Peri Ktismaton]]'' apotheosizes him. In literature and history though, he follows classical models, as is evident in the precision and lucidity of his narrative acquired from Thucydides, and in the reliability of his information, qualities of special merit in the historian. Procopius and to a great degree his successor Agathias remain the models of descriptive style as late as the 11th century. Procopius is the first representative of the ornate Byzantine style in literature and in this is surpassed only by [[Theophylaktos Simokattes]] in the 7th century. Despite their unclassical form, however, they approach the ancients in their freedom from ecclesiastical and dogmatic tendencies.

Between the historical writings of the first period and those of the second, there is an isolated series of works which in matter and form offer a strong contrast to both the aforesaid groups. These are the works under the name of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (10th century), dealing respectively with the administration of the empire, its political division, and the ceremonies of the Byzantine Court. They treat of the internal conditions of the empire, and the first and third are distinguished by their use of a popular tongue. The first is an important source of ethnological information, while the last is an interesting contribution to the history of civilization.

The second group of historians present a classical eclecticism veiling an unclassical partisanship and theological fanaticism. Revelling in classical forms, the historians of the period of the Comneni and Palaeologi were devoid of the classical spirit. While many had stronger, more sympathetic personalities than the school of Procopius, the very vigor of these individuals and their close ties to the imperial government served to hamper their objectivity, producing subjective, partisan works. Thus the "[[Alexiad]]", the pedantic work of Princess [[Anna Comnena]], glorifies her father [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexius]] and the imperial reorganization he began; the historical work of her husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, describes the internal conflicts that accompanied the rise of the Comneni in the form of a family chronicle (late 11th century); John VI Cantacuzene self-complacently narrates his own achievements (14th century). This group exhibits striking antitheses both personal and objective. Beside Cinnamus, who honestly hated everything Western, stand the broad-minded [[Nicetas Acominatus]] (12th century) and the conciliatory but dignified [[Georgius Acropolites]] (13th century); beside the theological polemicist Pachymeres (13th century), stands the man of the world, Nicephorus Gregoras (14th century), well versed in philosophy and the classics. Though subjective in matters of internal Byzantine history, these and others of this period are trustworthy in their accounts of external events, and especially valuable as sources for the first appearance of the Slavs and Turks.

==== Chroniclers ====
[[Image:Musee du Moyen Age A09.JPG|thumb|right|A Byzantine [[Gospel]] of the 13th century, it shows the increasing trend towards the use of [[Ivory]] as an artistic tool.]]
Unlike the historical works, Byzantine chronicles were intended for the general public; hence the difference in their origin, development, and diffusion, as well as in their character, method, and style. While the roots of the chronicle have not yet been satisfactorily traced, their comparatively late appearance (6th century) and total remove from Hellenistic tradition places their origins as fairly recent. The chronicle literature is originally foreign to Greek civilization, the first of which was composed by uneducated Syrians. Its presumable prototype, the "Chronography" of [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], points to an Oriental Christian source. Unconnected with persons of distinction and out of touch with the great world, it follows models bound within its own narrow sphere. The 9th century saw the zenith of the Byzantine chronicle, during the nadir of historical literature. Afterwards it declines abruptly; the lesser chroniclers, seen as late as the 12th century, draw partly from contemporary and partly, though rarely, from earlier historians. In the Palaeologi period no chroniclers of note appear.

Not only important sources for the history of Byzantine civilization, the chronicles themselves contributed to the spread of civilization, passing Byzantine culture to the arriving Slavic, [[Hungarian people|Magyar]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Depicting as they did what lay within the popular consciousness—events wonderful and dreadful painted in glaring colours and interpreted in a Christian sense—their influence was considerable. The method of handling materials is primitive—beneath each section lies some older source only slightly modified, so that the whole resembles a patchwork of materials rather than the ingenious mosaic of the historians. They are a rich store for comparative linguistics, as their diction is purely the popular tongue, bespeaking the poor education of author and audience.

Representative Byzantine chronicles are the three of [[Joannes Malalas]], [[Theophanes Confessor]], and [[Joannes Zonaras]], respectively. The first is the earliest Christian Byzantine monastic chronicle, composed in the Antioch in the 6th century by a hellenized Syrian and [[Monophysite]] theologian. Originally a city chronicle, it was expanded into a world-chronicle. It is a popular historical work, full of historical and chronological errors, and the first monument of a purely popular Hellenistic civilization. The chief source for most of the later chroniclers as well as for a few church historians, it is also the earliest popular history translated into [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. early 10th century). Superior in substance and form, and more properly historical, is the ''Chronicle'' of Theophanes, a 9th-century monk of Asia Minor, and in its turn a model for later chronicles. It contains much valuable information from lost sources, and its importance for the Western world is due to the fact that by the end of the 9th century it had to be translated into Latin. A third guide-post in the history of Byzantine chronicles is the 12th-century ''Universal Chronicle'' of [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]]. It reflects somewhat the atmosphere of the Comneni renaissance; not only is the narrative better than that of Theophanes, but many passages from ancient writers are worked into the text. It was translated not only into Slavic and Latin, but into [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] as well (16th century).

=== Encyclopedists and essayists ===
[[Image:Suda.jpg|thumb|right|A page from a 16th-century edition of the vast Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]], the ''[[Suda]]''.]]
The spirit of antiquarian scholarship awoke in Byzantium earlier than in the West, but begun by lay theologians, not laymen. For this reason it always had a scholastic flavor; the Byzantine [[Humanism|humanistic]] spirit savored of antiquity and the Middle Ages in equal proportion. Primarily directed to the systematic collection and sifting of [[manuscript]]s, a pronounced interest in the literature of Greek antiquity first manifested at Constantinople in the late 9th century. With the 12th century begins the period of original works imitating antique models, a revival of the [[Alexandrian essay]] and [[rhetoric]]al literature, a number of writers showing vigorous originality. Quite isolated between the two periods stands [[Michael Psellus]] (11th century), a universal genius who bridges the periods. While the humanism of the 9th and 10th centuries retained a theological coloring and a hostile attitude towards the West, the 12th to the 14th century saw several writers seeking to break away from orthodox classicism to attain a true humanism, becoming the forerunners of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The new spirit first found expression in an academy founded for classical studies at Constantinople in 863. About the same time the broadly trained and energetic [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], patriarch of the city and the greatest statesman of the Greek Church (820-897), enthusiastically collected forgotten manuscripts, revived forgotten works of antiquity, and re-discovered lost works; his attention was chiefly directed to prose works, indicative of his pragmatism. Photius made selections or excerpts from all the works he discovered, forming the beginning of his celebrated ''Bibliotheca'' ("Library"), which while dry and schematic remains the most valuable literary compendium of the Middle Ages, containing trustworthy summaries of many ancient works now lost, together with good characterizations and analyses such as those of [[Lucian]] and [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]]. This encyclopedic activity was more assiduously pursued in the 10th century, particularly in the systematic collecting of materials associated with Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]]. Scholars also formed great compilations, arranged by subject, on the basis of older sources. Among these was a now-fragmentary encyclopedia of political science containing extracts from the classical, Alexandrian, and Roman Byzantine periods. These, with the collection of ancient epigrams known as the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and the scientific dictionary known as the ''[[Suda]]'', make the 10th century that of the encyclopedias.

A typical representative of the period appears in the following century in the person of the greatest encyclopedist of Byzantine literature, Michael Psellus. Standing between the Middle Ages and modern times, he is a jurist and a man of the world with a mind both receptive and productive. Unlike Photius, who was more concerned with individual philosophic arguments, Psellus does not undervalue the old philosophers, and is himself of a philosophic temperament. He was the first of his intellectual circle to raise the philosophy of Plato above that of Aristotle and to teach philosophy as a professor. Surpassing Photius in intellect and wit, he lacks that scholar's dignity and solidity of character. A restless brilliance characterized his life and literary activity. At first a lawyer, then a professor; now a monk, now a court official; he ended his career the prime minister. He was equally adroit and many-sided in his literary work; in harmony with the polished, pliant nature of the courtier is his elegant [[Platonism|Platonic]] style of his letters and speeches. His extensive correspondence furnishes endless material illustrating his personal and literary character. The ennobling influence of his Attic models mark his speeches and especially his funerary orations; that delivered on the death of his mother shows deep sensibility. Psellus had more of a poetic temperament than Photius, as several of his poems show, though they owe more to satirical fancy and occasion than to deep poetic feeling. Though Psellus exhibits more formal skill than creativity, his endowments shone forth in a time particularly backward in aesthetic culture. The intellectual freedom of the great scholars (''[[polyhistor]]es''), both ecclesiastical and secular, of the following centuries would be inconceivable without the triumph of Psellus over Byzantine [[scholasticism]].
[[Image:Horologe1.jpg|thumb|left|A Modern copy of a Byzantine [[Horologion]], showing the daily cycle of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].]]
While among his successors—such as [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[Hyrtakenos]]—are natures as corrupt as Psellus' own, the majority are marked by their rectitude of intention, sincerity of feeling, and their beneficently broad culture. Among these great intellects and strong characters of the 12th century several theologians are especially conspicuous, for example [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], [[Michael Italicus]], and [[Michael Acominatus]]; in the 13th and 14th centuries several secular scholars, like [[Maximus Planudes]], [[Theodore Metochites|Theodorus Metochites]], and above all, [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

The three theologians may best be judged by their letters and minor occasional writings. Eustathius seems to be the most important, writing learned commentary on Homer and [[Pindar]] alongside original works that are candid, courageous, and controversial, intent upon the correction of every evil. In one of his works he attacks the corruption and intellectual stagnation of the monastic life of that day; in another polemic, he assails the hypocrisy and sham holiness of his time; in a third he denounces the conceit and arrogance of the Byzantine priests.

The rhetorician Michael Italicus, later a bishop, attacks the chief weakness of Byzantine literature, external imitation; this he did on receiving a work by a patriarch, which was simply a disorderly collection of fragments from other writers, so poorly put together that the sources were immediately recognizable.

The pupil and friend of Eustathius, Michael Acominatus (12th and 13th centuries) Archbishop of Athens and brother of the historian [[Nicetas Acominatus]]. His inaugural address, delivered on the Acropolis, exhibits both profound classical scholarship and high enthusiasm despite the material and spiritual decay of his times. These pitiful conditions moved him to compose an elegy, famous because unique, on the decay of Athens, a sort of poetical and antiquarian apostrophe to fallen greatness. [[Gregorovius]] compared the inaugural address with [[Gregory the Great]]'s to the Romans, and this with the lament of Bishop [[Hildebert of Tours]] on the demolition of Rome by the [[Normans]] (1106). His funeral orations over Eustathius (1195) and his brother Nicetas, though wordier and rhetorical, still evinced a noble disposition and deep feeling. Michael, like his brother, remained a fanatical opponent of the Latins. They had driven him into exile at [[Ceos]], whence he addressed many letters to his friends illustrating his character. Stylistically influenced by Eustathius, his otherwise classical diction sounded an ecclesiastical note.

With [[Theodore Metochites]] and [[Maximus Planudes|Maximos Planoudes]] we come to the universal scholars (polyhistores) of the time of the Palaeologi. The former displays his humanism in his use of hexameter, the latter in his knowledge of the Latin; both of which are otherwise unknown in Byzantium, and foreboding a broader grasp of antiquity. Both men show a fine sense of poetry, especially of nature poetry. Metochites composed meditations on the beauty of the sea; Planudes was the author of a long poetic idyll, a genre uncultivated by Byzantine scholars. While Metochites was a thinker and poet, Planudes was chiefly an imitator and compiler. Metochites was more speculative, as his collection of philosophical and historical miscellanies show; Planudes was more precise, as his preference for mathematics proves. Contemporary progress in philosophy was at a point where Metochites could openly attack Aristotle. He deals more frankly with political questions, such as his comparison of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. While his breadth of interest was large, Metochites's culture rests wholly on a Greek basis, though Planudes, by his translations from the Latin ([[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Ovid]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]), vastly enlarged the Eastern intellectual horizon.

This inclination toward the West is most noticeable in Nicephorus Gregoras, the great pupil of Metochites. His project for a reform of the calendar ranks him among the modern intellects of his time, as will be proven if ever his numerous works in every domain of intellectual activity are brought to light. His letters, especially, promise a rich harvest. His method of exposition is based on that of Plato, whom he also imitated in his ecclesiastico-political discussions, e.g. in his dialogue "Florentius, or Concerning Wisdom." These disputations with [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]] dealt with the question of church union, in which Gregoras took the Unionist part. This brought him bitter hostility and the loss of his teaching living; he had been occupied chiefly with the exact sciences, whereby he had already earned the hatred of orthodox Byzantines.

While the Byzantine essayists and encyclopedists stood wholly under the influence of ancient rhetoric, still they embodied in the traditional forms their own characteristic knowledge, and thereby lent it a new charm.

=== Secular poetry ===
Poetry likewise had its prototypes, each genre tracing its origins to an ancient progenitor. Unlike the prose, these new genres do not follow from the classical Attic period, for the Byzantines wrote neither Iyrics nor dramas, imitating neither Pindar nor Sophocles. Imitating the literature of the Alexandrian period, they wrote romances, [[panegyric]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire]]s, and didactic and hortatory poetry, following the models of [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Achilles Tatius]], [[Asclepiades of Samos|Asclepiades]] and [[Posidippus]], Lucian and [[Longus]]. Didactic poetry looks to an earlier prototype by [[Isocrates]]' ''Ad Demonicum''. The poetic temperament of the Byzantines is thus akin to that of the Alexandrian writers. Only one new type evolved independently by the Byzantines—the begging-poem. The six genres are not contemporaneous: the epigram and the panegyric developed first (6th and 7th centuries), then, at long intervals, satire, next didactic and begging poetry, finally the romance. Only after the 12th century, the period of decay, do they appear side by side. The epigram was the only form of secular poetry that had an independent revival in Byzantine literature, and this at the very time when ecclesiastical poetry also reached its highest perfection, in the 6th and 7th centuries. This age is therefore the most flourishing period of Byzantine scholarly poetry; its decline in the 12th century is contemporary with the rise of popular poetry. The chief kinds of poetry during the period of the decline (11th to 13th century) were satire and parody, didactic and hortatory poetry, the begging-poem, and the erotic romance. In form this literature is characterized by its extensive use of the popular forms of speech and verse, the latter being the "political" verse (Greek ἡμαξευμένοι στίχοι, called "that abominable make-believe of a metre" by [[Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''Dictionary''), an iambic verse of fifteen syllables, still the standard verse of modern Greek popular poetry &lt;!-- as of 1913 --&gt;. In content, however, all this literature continues to bear the imprint of Byzantine erudition.

==== Epigram ====
The epigram suited the Byzantine taste for the ornamental and for intellectual ingenuity. It corresponded exactly to the concept of the minor arts that attained high development in the Byzantine period. Making no lofty demands on the imagination of the author, its chief difficulty lay rather in technique and the attainment of the utmost possible pregnancy of phrase. Two groups may be distinguished among the Byzantine epigrammatists: one pagan and humanistic, the other Christian. The former is represented chiefly by [[Agathias]] (6th century) and [[Christophorus of Mitylene]] (11th century), the latter by the ecclesiastics [[Georgius Pisides]] (7th century) and [[Theodorus Studites]] (9th century). Between the two groups, in point of time as well as in character, stands [[Joannes Geometres]] (10th century).

The chief phases in the development of the Byzantine epigram are most evident in the works of these three. Agathias, who has already been mentioned among the historians, as an epigrammatist, has the peculiarities of the school of the semi-Byzantine Egyptian [[Nonnus]] (about AD 400). He wrote in an affected and turgid style, in the classical form of the [[hexameter]]; he abounds, however, in brilliant ideas, and in his skillful imitation of the ancients, particularly in his erotic pieces, he surpasses most of the epigrammatists of the imperial period. Agathias also prepared a collection of epigrams, partly his own and partly by other writers, some of which afterwards passed into the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and have thus been preserved. The abbot Theodorus Studites is in every respect the opposite of Agathias, a pious man of deep earnestness, with a fine power of observation in nature and life, full of sentiment, warmth, and simplicity of expression, free from servile imitation of the ancients, though influenced by Nonnus. While touching on the most varied things and situations, his epigrams on the life and personnel of his monastery offer special interest for the history of civilization. Joannes Geometres combines aspects of the previous two. During the course of his life he filled both secular and ecclesiastical offices and his poetry had a universal character; of a deeply religious temper, still he appreciated the greatness of the ancient Greeks. Alongside epigrams on ancient poets, philosophers, rhetoricians, and historians stand others on famous Church Fathers, poets, and saints. Poetically, the epigrams on contemporary and secular topics are superior to those on religious and classic subjects. His best works depict historical events and situations he himself experienced, and reflect his own spiritual moods (Krumbacher).
[[File:Porphyrogenetus.jpg|right|thumb|The Scholar Emperor [[Constantine VII]], being crowned by Christ.]]

==== Panegyrics ====
Even the best writers often could not escape composing the official panegyrics on emperors and their achievements. Typical of this kind of literature are the commemorative poem of [[Paulus Silentiarius]] on the dedication of the [[Hagia Sophia|church of St. Sophia]], and that of [[Georgius Pisides]] on the glory of the prince. Unfavorable conclusions must not be drawn as to the character of these poets, for such eulogies were composed by not only courtiers like Psellus and [[Manuel Holobolos]] (13th century), but also by independent characters like Eustathius and Michael Acominatus. It had become traditional, and so handed down from imperial Rome to Byzantium as a part of ancient rhetoric with all the extravagance of a thoroughly decadent literature (F. Gregorovius). It was a sort of necessary concession to despotism; popular taste was not in general offended by it.

==== Satires ====
The father of Byzantine satire is [[Lucian]]. His celebrated "Dialogues of the Dead" furnished the model for two works, one of which, the "[[Timarion]]" (12th century) is marked by more rude humour, the other, "[[Mazaris]]" (15th century), by keen satire. Each describes a journey to the underworld and conversations with dead contemporaries; in the former their defects are lashed with good-natured raillery; in the latter, under the masks of dead men, living persons and contemporary conditions, especially at the Byzantine Court, are sharply stigmatized. The former is more a literary satire, the latter a political pamphlet, with keen personal thrusts and without literary value, but with all the greater interest for the history of civilization; the former is in a genuinely popular tone, the latter in vulgar and crude [Cf. [[Henry Fanshawe Tozer|Tozer]] in ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (1881), II.233-270; [[Krumbacher]], op. cit., 198-211.]

Two popular offshoots of the "Timarion", the "Apokopos" and the "Piccatoros" are discussed below. Another group of satires takes the form of dialogues between animals, manifestly a development from the Christian popular book known as the ''[[Physiologus]]''. Such satires describe assemblages of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, and recite their [[parody|lampoon]]ing remarks upon the clergy, the bureaucracy, the foreign nations in the Byzantine Empire, etc. See also ''[[An Entertaining Tale of Quadrupeds]]''

Here belong also the parodies in the form of church poems, and in which the clergy themselves took part, e.g. Bishop [[Nicetas of Serræ]] (11th century). One example of this sacrilegious literature, though not fully understood, is the "Mockery of a Beardless Man," in the form of an obscene [[liturgy]] (14th century).

==== Didactic ====
Didactic poetry found its model in the "To Demonikos" ascribed to Isocrates. The greatest example of this type of literature in Byzantium is the "Spaneas" (12th century), a hortatory poem addressed by an emperor to his nephew, a sort of "[[Mirror for Princes]]". Some few offshoots from this are found in the popular literature of Crete in the 15th and 16th centuries, handed down under the names of [[Stephanos Sahlikis|Sahlikis]] and Depharanus. Here also belong the ranting theological exhortations resembling those of the Capuchin in [[Schiller]]'s "Wallenstein". Such, for instance, are that of Geogillas after the great plague of Rhodes (1498) and the oracular prophecies on the end of the Byzantine empire current under the name of [[Leo VI the Wise|Emperor Leo]] (886-911). (Krumbacher, 332, 336, 343, 352, 366.) &lt;!-- Huh? --&gt;

==== Begging-poem ====
A late Byzantine variety of the laudatory poem is the begging-poem, the poetical lament of hungry authors and the parasites of the court. Its chief representatives are [[Theodorus Prodromus]] and the grossly flattering [[Manuel Philes]], the former of whom lived under the Comneni (12th century), the latter under the Palaeologi (13th century). For historians such poetical wails of distress as Prodromus addressed to the emperor are of value because they give interesting pictures of street and business life in the capital. (Cf. Krumbacher, 324, 333.)

====Romance novel====
{{main article|Byzantine novel}}
The ancient Greek novel was imitated by four writers of the 12th century: [[Eustathios Makrembolites]], [[Theodore Prodromos]], [[Niketas Eugenianos]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].

=== Ecclesiastical and theological literature ===
The first flowering of ecclesiastical literature of Byzantium is Hellenistic in form and Oriental in spirit. This period falls in the 4th century and is closely associated with the names of the Greek Fathers of Alexandria, Palestine, Jerusalem, Cyrene, and [[Cappadocia]]. Their works, which cover the whole field of ecclesiastical prose literature—dogma, [[exegesis]], and [[homiletics]]—became canonical for the whole Byzantine period; the last important work is the ecclesiastical history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]]. Beyond controversial writings against sectarians and the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], later works consist merely of compilations and commentaries, in the form of the so-called ''Catenae''; even the ''Fountain of Knowledge'' of [[John of Damascus]] (8th century), the fundamental manual of Greek theology, though systematically worked out by a learned and keen intellect, is merely a gigantic collection of materials. Even the homily clings to a pseudo-classical, rhetorical foundation, and tends more to external breadth, not to inwardness and depth.

Only three kinds of ecclesiastical literature, which were as yet undeveloped in the 4th century, exhibit later an independent growth. These were the ecclesiastical poetry of the 6th century, popular lives of the saints of the 7th, and the mystic writings of the 11th and 12th centuries. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' suggests that classical forms were insufficient to express Christian thought to best effect: in several collections of early Christian correspondence it is not the rhythmic laws of Greek rhetorical style which govern the composition, but those of Semitic and Syriac prose. [[Cardinal Pitra]] hypothesizes that the rhythmic poetry of the Byzantines originates in the Jewish Psalms of the Septuagint. This rhythmic principle accords with the linguistic character of the later Greek, which used a stress accent as it had already been developed in Syriac poetry rather than the classical tonal accent.

[[Romanos the Melodist]] was the first great ecclesiastical poet of the Greeks to fully embrace the stress accent as a rhythmic principle. A contemporary and countryman of the chronicler Malalas, also a reformer of the Greek literary language, Romanos was a Syrian of Jewish descent, Christianized at an early age. What Malalas is to prose, Romanos is to the Christian poetry of the Greek Middle Ages. Though he did not go so far as Malalas, he released poetry from meters based on quantitative and tonal scansion; he brought it into harmony with the latest poetics prevailing in Syria as well as with the evolving character of the Greek language. Romanos soon went to Constantinople, where he became a deacon of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and where he is said to have first developed his gift for hymn-writing.

[[Image:RossanoGospelsFolio007vGoodSamaritan.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] from the Rossano Gospels, believed to be the oldest surviving illustrated New Testament.]]

Romanos borrowed the form of his poems, the material, and many of their themes partly from the Bible and partly from the (metrical) homilies of the Syrian Father [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] (4th century). He wrote hymns on the Passion of the Lord, on the betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial, Mary before the Cross, the Ascension, the Ten Virgins, and the Last Judgment, while his Old Testament themes mention the history of Joseph and the three young men in the fiery furnace. He is said to have composed about a thousand hymns, of which only eighty have survived, evidently because in the 9th century the so-called ''canones'', linguistically and metrically more artistic in form, replaced much of his work in the Greek Liturgy. Thenceforth his hymns held their own in only a few of the remoter monasteries. Characteristic of his technique is the great length of his hymns, which are regularly composed of from twenty to thirty stanzas (τροπαρια) of from twelve to twenty-one verses each, very finely wrought and varied in metrical structure, and in construction transparent and diverse. They do not resemble contemporary Latin hymns so much as the oratorios of the early 20th century, also using antiphonal rendering by alternative choirs. This also explains the dramatic character of many hymns, with their inserted dialogues and choric songs, as in "Peter's Denial", a little drama of human boastfulness and weakness, and the last part of the "History of Joseph", the "Psalm of the Apostles", and the "Birth of Jesus". Other pieces, like the hymn on the [[Last Judgment]], are purely descriptive in character, though even in them the rhetorical and dogmatic elements seriously impair the artistic effect.

Some, like Bouvy and Krumbacher, place him among the greatest hymn-writers of all times; others, like Cardinal Pitra, are more conservative. For a final judgment a complete edition of the hymns is needed. Compared to Latin church poets such as Ambrose and Prudentius, his surviving works tend towards a more rhetorically flowery, digressive, and dogmatic verse. He is fond of symbolic pictures and figures of speech, antitheses, assonances, especially witty ''jeux d'esprit'', which contrast with his characteristic simplicity of diction and construction. These embellishments interrupt the smooth flow of his lines, and often the sequence of thought in his hymns is clouded by the dragging in of dogmatic questions—in the celebrated Christmas hymn the question of the miraculous birth of Jesus is discussed four times, with a comfortable amplitude that betrays the theologian thrusting the poet aside. The theologian is also too evident in his allusions to the Old Testament when dealing with New Testament incidents; Mary at the birth of Jesus compares her destiny to that of Sarah, the Magi liken the star that went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and so on. The frequent citation of passages from the prophets seem more like unimpassioned paraphrases than like inspired poetry. In fact Romanos does not possess the abundant and highly coloured imagery of the earliest Greek church poets, nor their fine grasp of nature. The reader also gathers the impression that the height of the poet's imagination is not in proportion with the depth of his piety—there often appears in him something naive, almost homely, as when Mary expresses her pleasure in the Magi and calls attention to their utility for the impending Flight into Egypt. There are passages, however, in which devout fervor carries the imagination along with it and elevates the poetic tone, as in the jubilant invitation to the dance (in the Easter-song), in which thoughts of spring and of the Resurrection are harmoniously blended:

:Why thus faint-hearted?
:Why veil ye your faces?
:Lift up your hearts!
:Christ is arisen!
:Join in the dances,
:And with us proclaim it:
:The Lord is ascended,
:Gleaming and gloried,
:He who was born
:Of the giver of light.
:Cease then your mourning,
:Rejoice in blessedness:
:Springtime has come.
:So bloom now, ye lilies,
:Bloom and be fruitful!
:Naught bringeth destruction.
:Clap we our hands
:And shout: Risen is He
:Who helpeth the fallen ones
:To rise again.

Ecclesiastical poetry did not long remain on the high level to which Romanos had raised it. The "Hymnus Acathistus" (of unknown authorship) of the 7th century, a sort of [[Te Deum]] in praise of the Mother of God, is the last great monument of Greek church poetry, comparable to the hymns of Romanos, which it has even outlived in fame. It has had numerous imitators and as late as the 17th century was translated into Latin.

The rapid decline of Greek hymnology begins as early as the 7th century, the period of [[Andrew of Crete]]. Religious sentiments in hymns were choked by a classical formalism which stifled all vitality. The overvaluation of technique in details destroyed the sense of proportion in the whole. This seems to be the only explanation for the so-called canones first found in the collection of Andrew of Crete. While a canon is a combination of a number of hymns or chants (generally nine) of three or four strophes each, the "Great Canon" of Andrew actually numbers 250 strophes, a "single idea is spun out into serpentine arabesques".

Pseudo-classical artificiality found an even more advanced representative in [[John of Damascus]], in the opinion of the Byzantines the foremost writer of canones, who took as a model [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], even reintroducing the principle of quantity into ecclesiastical poetry. Religious poetry was in this way reduced to mere trifling, for in the 11th century, which witnessed the decline of Greek hymnology and the revival of pagan humanism, Michael Psellus began parodying church hymns, a practice that took root in popular culture. Didactic poems took this form without being regarded as blasphemous.

Religious drama did not thrive in the Byzantine era. The only example is the ''Suffering of Christ'' (''Christus Patiens'', ''Χριστὸς пάσχων ''), written in the 11th or 12th century; of its 2,640 verses, about one-third are borrowed from ancient dramas, chiefly from those of [[Euripides]], and Mary, the chief character, sometimes recites verses from the "Medea" of Euripides, again from the "Electra" of [[Sophocles]], or the "Prometheus" of [[Aeschylus]]. The composition is evidently the production of a theologian trained in the classics, but without the slightest idea of dramatic art. It is made up chiefly of lamentations and reports of messengers. Even the most effective scenes, those which precede the Crucifixion, are described by messengers; almost two-thirds of the text are given to the descent from the Cross, the lament of Mary, and the apparition of Christ. (Cf. Van Cleef, "The Pseudo-Gregorian Drama ''Christos paschon'' in its relation to the text of Euripides" in ''Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences'', VIII, 363-378; Krumbacher, 312.)

Between ecclesiastical poetry and ecclesiastical prose stands the theologico-didactic poem, a favorite species of ancient Christian literature. One of its best examples is the "Hexaemeron" of Georgius Pisides, a spirited hymn on the universe and its marvels, i.e. all living creatures. Taken as a whole, it is somewhat conventional; only the description of the minor forms of life, especially of the animals, reveals the skill of the epigrammatist and nature-lover's gift of affectionate observation.

Besides sacred poetry, [[hagiography]] flourished from the 6th to the 11th century. This species of literature developed from the old [[Martyrology|martyrologies]], and became the favorite form of popular literature. It flourished from the 8th to the 11th century, and was concerned principally with monastic life. Unfortunately, the rhetorical language was in violent contrast with the simple nature of the contents, so that the chief value of this literature is historical.

More popular in style are the biographers of saints of the 6th and 7th centuries. The oldest and most important of them is [[Cyril of Scythopolis]] (in Palestine), whose biographies of saints and monks are distinguished for the reliability of their facts and dates. Of great interest also for their contributions to the history of culture and of ethics and for their genuinely popular language are the writings of Leontius, Archbishop of Cyprus (7th century), especially his life of the Patriarch John (surnamed The Merciful), Eleemosynarius of Alexandria. (Cf. [[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Kleine Schriften'', Leipzig, 1907.) This life describes for us a man who in spite of his peculiarities honestly tried "to realize a pure Biblical Christianity of self-sacrificing love", and whose life brings before us the customs and ideas of the lower classes of the people of Alexandria.

The romance of Balaam and Joasaph (also [[Barlaam and Josaphat]]) was another popular work of Byzantine origin now elevated to universal literature. It is the "Song of Songs" of Christian asceticism, illustrated by the experience of the Indian prince Joasaph, who is led by the hermit Barlaam to abandon the joys of life, and as a true Christian to renounce the world. The material of the story is originally Indian, indeed [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]], for the origin of Joasaph was [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The Greek version originated in the Sabbas monastery in Palestine about the middle of the 7th century. It did not circulate widely until the 11th century, when it became known to all Western Europe through the medium of a Latin translation [Cf. [[F. C. Conybeare]], "The Barlaam and Josaphat legend," in ''Folk-lore'' (1896), VII, 101 sqq.]

The ascetic conception of life was embedded in the Byzantine character and was strengthened by the high development of monastic institutions. The latter in turn brought forth a broad ascetic literature, though it does not further deepen the asceticism of its great exponent, St. [[Basil of Caesarea]].

Less extensively cultivated, but excelling in quality, are Byzantine mystical writings. The true founder of a distinctively ''Byzantine'' [[mysticism]] was [[Maximus the Confessor]] (7th century), who deepened the tradition of Christian Neoplatonism, as found in the Pseudo-Dionysius, with the resources of Orthodox Christology. No other writer in Eastern Christian tradition surpasses Maximus in speculative range and originality. Later representatives of this mystical tradition were [[Symeon the New Theologian]] and [[Nicetas Stethatos]] in the 11th, and [[Nikolaos Kavasilas]] in the 14th century. The Byzantine mystical writers differ from those of Western Europe chiefly in their attitude to ecclesiastical ceremonies, to which they adhered implicitly, seeing in it a profound symbol of the spiritual life of the church, where Occidentals see an attempt to displace the inner life with external pomp. Accordingly, Symeon strictly observed the ceremonial rules of the church, regarding them, however, only as a means to the attainment of ethical perfection. His principal work (published only in Latin) is a collection of prose pieces and hymns on communion with God. He is akin to the chief [[German mystic]]s in his tendency towards pantheism. Of Symeon's equally distinguished pupil, Nicetas Stethatos, we need only say that he cast off his teacher's [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. The last great mystic Kavasilas, Archbishop of Saloniki, revived the teaching of [[Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite]], but in the plan of his principal work, "Life in Christ", exhibits a complete independence of all other worlds and is without a parallel in Byzantine asceticism.

=== Popular poetry ===
The [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture of Constantinople]] and establishment of the [[Latinokratia|Latin kingdoms]] in the year 1204 displaced or supplanted aristocratic and ecclesiastic controls on literary taste and style. In response to new influences from the [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin West]], Byzantine popular literature moved in different directions. Whereas literary poetry springs from the rationalistic, classical atmosphere of the Hellenistic period, popular poetry, or folk-song, is an outgrowth of the idyllic, romantic literature of the same period. As the literary works had their prototypes in Lucian, Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, and Nonnus, the popular works imitated [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Callimachus]], [[Theocritus]], and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]].

The chief characteristic of folk-song throughout the Greek Middle Ages is its lyric note, which constantly finds expression in emotional turns. In Byzantine literature, on the other hand, the refinement of erotic poetry was due to the influence of the love-poetry of [[chivalry]] introduced by Frankish knights in the 13th century and later. The Byzantines imitated and adapted the romantic and legendary materials these westerners brought. Italian influences led to the revival of the drama. That celebration of the achievements of Greek heroes in popular literature was the result of the conflicts which the Greeks sustained during the Middle Ages with the border nations to the east of the empire. Popular books relating the deeds of ancient heroes had long-standing and widespread currency throughout the East; these too revived heroic poetry, though imparted with a deep romantic tinge. The result was a complete upheaval of popular ideals and a broadening of the popular horizon as Atticist tendencies were gradually eroded.

There was, consequently, a complete reconstruction of the literary types of Byzantium. Of all the varieties of artistic poetry there survived only the romance, though this became more serious in its aims, and its province expanded. Of metrical forms there remained only the political (fifteen-syllable) verse. From these simple materials there sprang forth an abundance of new poetic types. Alongside of the narrative romance of heroism and love there sprang up popular love lyrics, and even the beginnings of the modern drama.
[[Image:Troodos mountains.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Troodos Mountains]], from which [[Digenis Akritas]] used to jump to [[Asia Minor]] in the epic poem]]
The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Akritas]]'', a popular poetic crystallization of the 10th- and 11th-century conflicts between the Byzantine wardens of the [[marches]] (ακρίτης, [[akrites]]) and the [[Saracens]] in Eastern Asia Minor. The nucleus of this epic goes back to the 12th or 13th century, its final literary form to the 15th. Though the [[schoolmen]] edited the original poems beyond recognition, an approximate idea of the original poem may be gathered from the numerous echoes of it extant in popular poetry. The existing versions exhibit a blending of several cycles, modeled after the Homeric poems. Its principal subjects are love, adventures, battles, and a patriarchal, idyllic enjoyment of life; it is a mixture of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the majority of the material being drawn from the latter, suffused with a Christian atmosphere. Genuine piety and a strong family feeling combine with an intimate sympathy with nature. Artistically, the work lacks the dramatic quality and diverse characters of the Germanic and classical Greek epics; it must be compared with the Slavic and Oriental heroic songs, among which it properly belongs.

The love-romance of the Greek Middle Ages is the result of the fusion of the sophistical Alexandro-Byzantine romance and the medieval French popular romance, on the basis of a Hellenistic view of life and nature. This is proved by its three chief creations, composed in the 13th and 14th centuries. ''[[Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe]]'', ''[[Belthandros and Chrysantza]]'', ''[[Lybistros and Rhodamne]]''. While the first and the last of these are markedly influenced by Byzantine romance in thought and manner of treatment, the second begins to show the aesthetic and ethical influence of the Old-French romance; indeed, its story often recalls the [[Tristan]] legend. The style is clearer and more transparent, the action more dramatic, than in the extant versions of the Digenis legend. The ethical idea is the romantic idea of knighthood—the winning of the loved one by valour and daring, not by blind chance as in the Byzantine literary romances. Along with these independent adaptations of French material, are direct translations from "Flore et Blanchefleur", "Pierre et Maguelonne", and others, which have passed into the domain of universal literature.

To the period of [[Frangokratia|Frankish conquest]] belongs also the metrical ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'' (14th century). It was composed by a Frank brought up in Greece, though a foe of the Greeks. Its object was, amid the constantly progressing hellenization of the Western conquerors, to remind them of the spirit of their ancestors. Therefore, it is only Greek in language; in literary form and spirit it is wholly Frankish. The author "describes minutely the feudal customs which had been transplanted to the soil of Greece, and this perhaps is his chief merit; the deliberations of the High Court are given with the greatest accuracy, and he is quite familiar with the practice of feudal law" (J. Schmitt). As early as the 14th century the Chronicle was translated into Spanish and in the 15th into French and Italian.

About the same time and in the same locality the small islands off the coast of Asia Minor, appeared the earliest collection of neo-Greek love songs, known as the "''Rhodian Love-Songs''". Besides songs of various sorts and origins, they contain a complete romance, told in the form of a play on numbers, a youth being obliged to compose a hundred verses in honor of the maiden whom he worships before she returns his love, each verse corresponding to the numbers one to one hundred.

Between the days of the French influence in the 13th and 14th centuries and those of Italian in the 16th and 17th, there was a short romantic and popular revival of the ancient legendary material. There was neither much need nor much appreciation for this revival, and few of the ancient heroes and their heroic deeds are adequately treated. The best of these works is the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', based on the story of [[Alexander the Great]], a revised version of the [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] of the Ptolemaic period, which is also the source of the western versions of the ''Alexander Romance''. The ''[[Achilleis byzantina|Achilleis]]'', on the other hand, though written in the popular verse and not without taste, is wholly devoid of antique local colour, and is rather a romance of French chivalry than a history of Achilles. Lastly, of two compositions on the [[Trojan War]], one is wholly crude and barbarous, the other, though better, is a literal translation of the old French poem of [[Benoît de Sainte-More]].

To these products of the 14th century may be added two of the 16th, both describing a descent into the lower world, evidently popular offshoots of the Timarion and Mazaris already mentioned. To the former corresponds the ''Apokopos'', a satire of the dead on the living; to the latter the ''Piccatores'', a metrical piece decidedly lengthy but rather unpoetic, while the former has many poetical passages (e.g. the procession of the dead) and betrays the influence of Italian literature. In fact [[Italian literature]] impressed its popular character on the Greek popular poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries, as [[French literature]] had done in the 13th and 14th.

==== Cretan popular poetry ====
As a rich popular poetry sprang up during the last-mentioned period on the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, so now a similar literature developed on the island of [[Crete]]. Its most important creations are the romantic epic ''[[Erotokritos]]'' and the dramas ''[[Erophile]]'' and ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' with a few minor pictures of customs and manners. These works fall chronologically outside the limits of Byzantine literature; nevertheless, as a necessary complement and continuation of the preceding period, they should be discussed here.

The ''Erotokritos'' is a long romantic poem of chivalry, lyric in characters and didactic in purpose, the work of [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], a hellenized Venetian of the 16th century. It abounds in themes and ideas drawn from the folk-poetry of the time. In the story of Erotokritos and Arethusa the poet glorifies love and friendship, chivalric courage, constancy, and self-sacrifice. Although foreign influences do not obtrude themselves, and the poem, as a whole, has a national Greek flavour, it reveals the various cultural elements, Byzantine, Romance, and Oriental, without giving, however, the character of a composite.

The lyrical love tragedy ''Erophile'' is more of a mosaic, being a combination of two Italian tragedies, with the addition of lyrical intermezzos from [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', and choral songs from his ''Aminta''. Nevertheless, the materials are handled with independence, and more harmoniously arranged than in the original; the father who has killed his daughter's lover is slain not by his daughter's hand, but by the ladies of his palace, thus giving a less offensive impression. Owing to the lyric undertone of the works some parts of it have survived in popular tradition until the present time.

The [[mystery play]] of ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' is a little psychological masterpiece, apparently an independent work. The familiar and trite Biblical incidents are reset in the patriarchal environment of Greek family life. The poet emphasizes the mental struggles of Sarah, the resignation of Abraham to the Divine will, the anxious forebodings of Isaac, and the affectionate sympathy of the servants, in other words, a psychological analysis of the characters. The mainspring of the action is Sarah's fore-knowledge of what is to happen, evidently the invention of the poet to display the power of maternal love. The diction is distinguished by high poetic beauty and by a thorough mastery of versification.

Other products of Cretan literature are a few adaptations of Italian pastorals, a few erotic and idyllic poems, like the so-called "''Seduction Tale''" (an echo of the Rhodian Love-Songs), and the lovely, but ultra-sentimental, pastoral idyll of the ''Beautiful Shepherdess''.

== The legacy of Byzantine literature ==
The Roman supremacy in governmental life did not disappear. The subjection of the Church to the power of the State led to a governmental ecclesiasticism, causing friction with [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had remained relatively independent.

Greek eventually overtook [[Latin]] as the [[official language]] of the government, the "Novellae" of [[Justinian I]] being the last Latin monument. As early as the 7th century [[Greek language]] had made great progress, and by the 11th Greek was supreme, though it never supplanted the numerous other languages of the empire.

The Eastern Roman Empire divided European civilization into two parts: one [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], the other Greek and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]. These cultures differed ethnographically, linguistically, ecclesiastically, and historically. Imperial [[Russia]], the [[Balkans]], and [[Ottoman Empire]] were the direct heirs of Byzantine civilization; the first two particularly in ecclesiastical, political, and cultural respects (through the translation and adaptation of sacred, historical, and popular literature); the third in respect to civil government.

Indirectly, the Empire protected western Europe for centuries from war, fighting off various invaders and migratory populations. Byzantium was also a treasury of ancient Greek literature. During the Middle Ages, until the capture of the Constantinople, the West was acquainted only with Roman literature. Greek antiquity was first carried to Italy by the treasures brought by fugitive Greek humanists, many of whom were delegates at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1431 to 1449.

Byzantine culture had a direct influence upon southern and central Europe in church music and church poetry, though this was only in the very early period (until the 7th century).

Byzantine culture had a definite impact upon the Near East, especially upon the [[Persian people|Persians]], and the [[Arabs]].

There is no comprehensive history of Byzantine literature written in English, although the [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] provides excellent coverage of individual authors and topics. The chapters of Horrocks that cover the medieval period are useful for the "language question." The ''History'' of Kazhdan covers only the early period. Beaton and Lauxtermann are useful on "low" and "high" verse, respectively.

The study of Byzantine literature as a self-sufficient discipline originated in the German-speaking world, and the most important general surveys are written in this language. Beck and Hunger remain the standard works on theological and secular literature, respectively, although Krumbacher and Moravcsik are still valuable. Rosenqvist is a recent and useful introduction to the subject.

The gold '''Casco de Leiro''' ("[[Helmet]] of Leiro") is a ritual hemispherical [[cap]] probably dating to the end of the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]; "We believe that the most coherent archaeological context for the dating of Leiro would correspond to the final centuries of the Late Bronze Age"  ([http://webs.uvigo.es/beacomendador/index_archivos/LEIRO.pdf Beatriz Comendador Rey, "The Leiro Hoard (Galicia, Spain): the lonely find?"], ''Gold und kult der Bronzezeit'', exhibition catalogue, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, 2003:176-188)&lt;/ref&gt; (''circa'' 1,000 to 800 BC) in the town of [[Leiro, Rianxo|Leiro]] (municipality of [[Rianxo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]). The circumstances of its discovery show that technically it constitutes a [[hoard]].&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by Almeida ''et al.'', "Galicia Different Place: da cronoloxía do ouro precastrexo e ouros tópicos", ''Historia Nova: Contribución dos Xoves Historiadores do Galicis'' '''3''' (1994:30f), noted by Comendador Rey 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cap, hammered from a single casting of gold,&lt;ref&gt;Armbruster 1999:243f&lt;/ref&gt; is entirely covered with registers of repeated [[repoussé]] decoration, hammered over bronze molds, of repeated bosses alternating with bands of repeated concentric circles. The central point is applied with a flat-sided point in the form of a truncated cone. Its maximum diameter is 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 15&amp;nbsp;cm to the base of the point, it weighs 270 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[[:gl:Casco de Leiro|Gallego Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Its registers of hammered decoration present parallels with the decors of late Bronze Age conical [[golden hats]] of the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt type]] and the gold bowls found at [[Axtroki|Axtroki, Guipúzcoa]], or the so-called  [[Treasure of Villena]], Alicante. There is a possibility that its uses were twofold: as a ritual basin, though it is decoratively pierced with an [[wikt:awl|awl]], and inverted as an emblem of authority.

The casque was a chance discovery made by a fisherman, José Vicente Somoza, on 7 April 1976 at a small rocky point called [[Curruncho dos Porcos]], by the beach at [[Leiro]] (Rianxo) in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]]. The site, on the large estuary called the Ría de Arousa, is part of the estuary system of the [[Ulla]],  which offers "optimum conditions for navigation" and has served since time immemorial as an easy passage into the heart of Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey, 2003:&lt;/ref&gt; Removing some earth to flatten a space for a shed in which to beach his boat, he struck a coarsely made&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey 2003, judging from the few isolated [[sherd]]s suggests "a good-size hemispherical vessel with a coarse finish".&lt;/ref&gt; earthenware crock that broke as he struck it. He immediately saw that it contained a gold object, and he reported the find to the Guardia Civil of Rianxo and the Department of Archaeology at the [[Instituto Padre Sarmiento]]. The find was transferred to the Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico of [[A Coruña]], where it is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' is an Egyptian wooden [[chair]] dated to the [[15th century BC|15th century B.C]]. The chair, currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], belonged to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[scribe]] [[Renyseneb|Reniseneb]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/547687|title=Chair of Reniseneb|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Ayman Mohamed|date=2014-01-28|title=Furniture industry through the real models and scenes in the ancient Egyptian art: Chairs, stools models |url=https://www.unioviedo.es/reunido/index.php/RM/article/view/10128|journal=Res Mobilis|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=146–166|doi=10.17811/rm.3.2014.146-166|issn=2255-2057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' was crafted circa [[1450s BC|1450 B.C]] during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], sixth [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]. Inscriptions on the chair indicate it belonged to the scribe Reniseneb (also referred to as Reni-seneb or Renyseneb). The chair is made from ebony and carved ivory. It is believed that the chair was originally less detailed then it currently is, and that additional inscriptions were added to the chair when Reniseneb died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The chair is notably the oldest (excluding royal chairs) surviving chair of its style from Egypt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The seat of the chair is a reproduction made from [[Caning (furniture)|woven reeds]], as the original seat has long since decayed. An image of Reniseneb seated in a similar chair is carved into the backrest of the chair, and its feet take the form of carved [[Lion|lion claws]]. [[Lotus flowers]] are also depicted on the chair's carved ivory, possibly due to Egyptian's association of lotus flowers with rebirth and healing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Each character in '''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''' is distinctly different, and defined by their movement, actions, [[Commedia dell'Arte Masks|masks]], and costumes. These costumes show their social status and background.

'''[[Pantalone]]''' typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a [[codpiece]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lea, K. M. Italian popular comedy. A study in the Commedia dell’Arte, 1560–1620 with special reference to the English stage. 1934. Reprint.

New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Il Dottore]]''' was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Il Capitano]]''' did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country.  Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Innamorati|The Lovers]]''' wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Pulcinella]]''' always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gordon, Mel. Lazzi: The Comedic Routines of the Commedia dell’Arte.

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Scaramouche]]
{{Right|[[File:André Derain - Arlequin et Pierrot.jpg|thumb|Harlequin in diamonds, and Pierrot in white]]}}
'''[[Harlequin|Harlequin's]]''' costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Brighella]]''' wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Coviello]]''' had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Mezzettino]]''' wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Zanni]]''' was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Scapino]]''' wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pierrot]]''' had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pedrolino|Pedrolino's]]''' costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''{{ill|Peppe Nappa|it}}''' copied Pierrot's clothes, but wore them in blue instead of white.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Columbina|Columbina's]]''' costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Scaramouche]]''' wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia]]''' wore a black hat and very thick glasses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Rosetta]]''' was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Trivelino]]''' was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Creative limitation''' is the concept of how purposely limiting oneself can actually drive creativity. At a 2013 [[TED (conference) |TED conference]], artist [[Phil Hansen (artist)|Phil Hansen]] made several remarks concerning the value of limitations, among them that "We need to first be limited in order to become limitless,” and “If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.”&lt;ref name=TED.com group=TED.com&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Kate Torgovnick|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/05/can-limitations-make-you-more-creative-a-qa-with-artist-phil-hansen/|title=Can limitations make you more creative? A Q&amp;A with artist Phil Hansen|work=Writer|publisher=TED Blog|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative limitation can also be thought of as a way to achieve a novel effect or goal that is not otherwise possible using [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], readily accessible, methods. [[Igor Stravinsky]] used what he called creative limitation with [[time signature]]s, by restricting himself from using any, in his [[musical composition|composition]] '[[The Rite of Spring]]' as well as in alternate aspects of his other musical works.

[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|240px|The title page of the Shakespeare [[First Folio]], 1623]]
The term "'''folio'''", from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''folium'' (leaf),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beal | first = Peter | year = 2008 | contribution = folio | title = A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000 | edition = Online | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/ | accessdate = 22 November 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has three interconnected but distinct meanings in the world of books and printing.  It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way.  Secondly, it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly, an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size.

Firstly, a folio (abbreviated '''fo''' or '''2°''') is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded once to produce two [[leaf (books) |leaves]].  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. Ordinarily, additional printed folio sheets would be inserted inside one another to form a group or "gathering" of leaves prior to binding the book.

Secondly, "folio" is used in terms of [[page numbering]] for some books and most [[manuscript]]s that are bound but without page numbers as an equivalent of "page" (both sides), "sheet" or "leaf", using "[[recto and verso|recto]]" and "[[recto and verso|verso]]" to designate the first and second sides, and (unlike the usage in printing) disregarding whether the leaf concerned is actually physically still joined with another leaf. This usually appears abbreviated: "f26r." means the first side of the 26th leaf in a book.  This will be on the right hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as [[Latin script |Latin]] (as used in English), [[Cyrillic script |Cyrillic]], or [[Greek script |Greek]], and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as [[Hebrew script |Hebrew]] and [[Arabic script  |Arabic]].

Thirdly, ''folio'' is also used as an approximate term for a size of book, typically about {{convert |15|in|cm}} tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. Other common book formats are ''[[quarto]]'' and ''[[octavo]]'', which are both also printing formats, involving two and three folds in the sheet respectively.

Famous folios (in both senses) include the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed in about 1455, and the [[First Folio]] collected edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, printed in 1623; however, their actual size is rather different.

== Format ==
A folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of folium, leaf &lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2d ed, (1989), on line access.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves.  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a [[quarto]], folding each sheet twice, and [[octavo]], folding each sheet three times.  Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a [[Paper knife|paper-knife]].

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|left|Lenox copy of the Gutenberg bible printed in folio format.]]
There are variations in how folios are produced.  For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a folio (two leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a "folio in 8s." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald B. McKerrow]], ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'', Oxford 1927 and later eds., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was printed in about 1455 as a folio, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once.  The page size is 12 x 17.5 inches (307 x 445&amp;nbsp;mm), a "double folio" size.  Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside one another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book.  Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] edition is printed as a folio and has a page height of 12.5 inches (320&amp;nbsp;mm), making it a rather small folio size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/dl_crosscollex/brbldl/oneITEM.asp?pid=2018031&amp;iid=1071364&amp;srchtype= Beinecke Library, Yale]&lt;/ref&gt;

Folios were a common format of books printed in the [[incunabula]] period (books printed before 1501), although the earliest printed book, surviving only as a fragment of a leaf, is a [[Sibyllenbuch fragment|quarto]]. The [[British Library]] [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9450&amp;sort=idx-year Search of Incunabula Short Title Catalog for imprints before 1501, sorted by date.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  of which about 8,600 are folios,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9461&amp;sort=idx-year British Library, Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, search for imprints before 1501 and format as "fo", sorted by year.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; representing just over 30 percent of all works in the catalogue.

== Page numbering ==
[[File:Recto and verso.svg|thumb|230px|Left-to-right language books (such as English)]]
[[File:Recto and verso RTL.svg|thumb|230px|Right-to-left language books (such as Arabic)]]
{{Main|Recto and verso}}

In the discussion of manuscripts, a folio means a leaf with two pages, the [[recto]] being the first the reader encounters, and the [[verso]] the second. In Western books, which are read by turning the pages over from right to left, when the book is begun with the open page edges at the reader's right, the first page to be seen is "folio 1 recto", typically abbreviated to "f1 r.". When this page is turned over "f1 v." is on the left and "f2 r." on the right of the "opening", or two pages that are visible.  For books in Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and other languages, where the book is begun from the back in Western terms, with the open page edges at the reader's left, the numbering also follows the sequence in which the reader encounters.

In the discussion of two-columned manuscripts, a/b/c/d can denote the left and right-hand columns of recto and verso pages (e.g. "f. 150a" and "f. 150b" are the left and right hand columns on the recto page, and "f. 150c" and "f. 150d" the left and right hand columns on the verso page).  In the discussion of three-columned manuscripts, notation may make use of folio number + recto/verso + column a/b/c (e.g. "f. 3 v. col. c" references the third column on the verso side of the third folio).

== Size ==

The actual size of a folio book depends on the [[Paper size|size of the full sheet of paper]] on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, printers used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127&amp;nbsp;cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63&amp;nbsp;cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58&amp;nbsp;cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51&amp;nbsp;cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46&amp;nbsp;cm), and (the most common) Crown Folio (15 inches, ca 38&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel.com/books/booksize.htm|title=Book Sizes|work=trussel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time.  As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press).  The term "folio" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 15&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

== Shakespeare folios ==

From the earliest days of printing, folios were often used for expensive, prestigious volumes.   In the Seventeenth Century, plays of the [[English Renaissance theatre]] were printed as collected editions in folio.  Thirty-six of Shakespeare's plays, for example, were included in the [[First Folio]] collected edition of 1623, which was followed by additional folio editions, referred to as the [[Second Folio]], etc. Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in folio editions, such as [[Ben Jonson]]'s collected works of 1616.

'''German art''' has a long and distinguished tradition in the [[visual arts]], from the earliest known work of figurative art to its current output of [[contemporary art]].

Germany has only been united into a single state since the 19th century, and defining its borders has been a notoriously difficult and painful process. For earlier periods German art often effectively includes that produced in German-speaking regions including [[Austria]], [[Alsace]] and much of [[Switzerland]], as well as [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|largely German-speaking cities or regions to the east]] of the modern German borders.

Although tending to be neglected relative to Italian and French contributions from the point of view of the [[English-speaking world]], German art has played a crucial role in the development of [[Western art]], especially [[Celtic art]], [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  From the development of [[Romanesque art]], France and Italy began to lead developments for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], but the production of an increasingly wealthy Germany remained highly important.  The [[German Renaissance]] developed in rather different directions to the [[Italian Renaissance]], and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the early German domination of printing.  The final phase of the Renaissance, [[Northern Mannerism]], was centred around the edges of the German lands, in [[Flanders]] and the Imperial capital of [[Prague]], but, especially in architecture, the German [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] took up these imported styles with enthusiasm. The German origins of [[Romanticism]] did not lead to an equally central position in the visual arts, but German participation in the many broadly [[Modernist]] movements following the collapse of [[Academic art]] have been increasing important.  

==Prehistory to Late Antiquity==
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Hohle Fels]], 35,000 to 40,000 BP, the oldest known figurative work of art (true height {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}}).]]
The area of modern [[Germany]] is rich in finds of [[prehistoric art]], including the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]]. This appears to be the oldest undisputed example of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic art]] and [[figurative art|figurative]] sculpture of the human form in general, from over 35,000 years BP, which was only discovered in 2008;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/14/science/sci-venus14 Venus figurine sheds light on origins of art by early humans] [[Los Angeles Times]], May 14, 2009, accessed December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the better-known [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24–22,000 BP) comes from a little way over the Austrian border. The spectacular finds of [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[golden hat]]s are centred on Germany, as was the "central" form of [[Urnfield culture]], and [[Hallstatt culture]]. In the [[Iron Age]] the "Celtic" [[La Tène culture]] centred on Western Germany and Eastern France, and Germany has produced many major finds of [[Celtic art]] like the elite burials at [[European Archaeological Park of Bliesbruck-Reinheim|Reinheim]] and [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]], and ''[[oppida]]'' towns like [[Glauberg]], [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]] and [[Heuneburg]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After lengthy wars, the [[Roman Empire]] settled its frontiers in [[Germania]] with the [[Limes Germanicus]] to include much of the south and west of modern Germany. The German provinces produced art in provincial versions of Roman styles, but centres there, as over the Rhine in France, were large-scale producers of fine [[Ancient Roman pottery]], exported all over the Empire. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Rheinzabern]] was one of the largest, which has been well-excavated and has a dedicated museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra-sigillata-museum.de/ Terra Sigillata Museum Rheinzabern] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Romanized areas of the later Roman period fall under [[Migration Period art]], notable for metalwork, especially jewellry (the largest pieces apparently mainly worn by men). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:BambergApocalypseFolio025vAngelWithLittleBook.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Bamberg Apocalypse]], from the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Reichenau School]], achieves monumentality in a small scale. 1000–1020.]]
German medieval art really begins with the [[Frankish Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (d. 814), the first state to rule the great majority of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. [[Carolingian art]] was restricted to a relatively small number of objects produced for a circle around the court and a number of [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbeys]] they sponsored, but had a huge influence on later [[Medieval art]] across Europe. The most common type of object to survive is the [[illuminated manuscript]]; wall paintings were evidently common but, like the buildings that housed them, have nearly all vanished. The earlier centres of illumination were located in modern France, but later [[Metz]] in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] in modern [[Switzerland]] came to rival them. The [[Drogo Sacramentary]] and [[Folchard Psalter]] are among the manuscripts they produced.&lt;ref&gt;See Hinks throughout, Chapters 1 of Beckwith and 3–4 of Dodwell&lt;/ref&gt;

No Carolingian [[monumental sculpture]] survives, although perhaps the most important patronage of Charlemagne was his commissioning of a life-size gold figure of [[Christ]] on a [[crucifix]] for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]; this is only known from literary references and was probably gold foil around a wooden base, probably modelled with a [[gesso]] layer, like the later and rather crumpled [[Golden Madonna of Essen]]. [[Early Christian art]] had not featured monumental sculptures of religious figures as opposed to rulers, as these were strongly associated by the [[Church Fathers]] with the cult idols of [[Ancient Roman religion]]. [[Byzantine art]] and modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious art have maintained the prohibition to the present day, but Western art was apparently decisively influenced by the example of Charlemagne to abandon it. Charlemagne's circle wished to revive the glories of classical style, which they mostly knew in its [[Late Antique]] form, and also to compete with [[Byzantine art]], in which they appear to have been helped by refugee artists from the convulsions of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]]. As Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been very interested in visual art, his political rivalry with the [[Byzantine Empire]], supported by the [[Papacy]], may have contributed to the strong pro-image position expressed in the [[Libri Carolini]], which set out the position on images held with little variation by the Western Church for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 32 on the ''Libri Carolini''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next [[Ottonian dynasty]], whose core territory approximated more closely to modern Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, [[Ottonian art]] was mainly a product of the large monasteries, especially [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] which was the leading Western artistic centre in the second half of the 10th century. The Reichenau style uses simplified and patterned shapes to create strongly expressive images, far from the classical aspirations of Carolingian art, and looking forward to the Romanesque. The wooden [[Gero Cross]] of 965–970 in [[Cologne Cathedral]] is both the oldest and the finest early medieval near life-size crucifix figure; art historians had been reluctant to credit the records giving its date until they were confirmed by [[dendrochronology]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the rest of Europe, metalwork was still the most prestigious form of art, in works like the jewelled [[Cross of Lothair]], made about 1000, probably in [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Maria laach teufel schriftrolle.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] carving from [[Maria Laach]] Abbey]]

[[Romanesque art]] was the first artistic movement to encompass the whole of [[Western Europe]], though with regional varieties. Germany was a central part of the movement, though [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture|German Romanesque architecture]] made rather less use of sculpture than that of France. With increasing prosperity massive churches were built in cities all over Germany, no longer just those patronized by the Imperial circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The French invented the [[Gothic art|Gothic style]], and Germany was slow to adopt it, but once it had done so Germans made it their own, and continued to use it long after the rest of Europe had abandoned it. According to [[Henri Focillon]], Gothic allowed German art "to define for the first time certain aspects of its native genius-a vigorous and emphatic conception of life and form, in which theatrical ostentation mingled with vehement emotional frankness."&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 106&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bamberg Horseman]] of the 1330s, in [[Bamberg Cathedral]], is the oldest large post-antique standing stone equestrian statue; more medieval princely [[tomb monument]]s have survived from Germany than France or England. Romanesque and Early Gothic churches had wall paintings in local versions of international styles, of which few artists' names are known.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThreeFoolishVirginsMagdeburg.jpg|thumb|left|Three [[Parable of the Ten Virgins|Foolish Virgins]], [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], c. 1250.]]

The court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], then based in [[Prague]], played an important part in forming the [[International Gothic]] style in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 24-7, 37 &amp; passim, Snyder, Chapter II&lt;/ref&gt; The style was spread around the wealthy cities of Northern Germany by artists such [[Conrad von Soest]] in [[Westphalia]] and [[Meister Bertram]] in [[Hamburg]], and later [[Stefan Lochner]] in [[Cologne]]. Hamburg was one of the cities in the [[Hanseatic League]], then at the height of its prosperity, and Bertram was succeeded in the city by artists such as [[Master Francke]], the [[Master of the Malchin Altar]], [[Hans Bornemann]], [[Hinrik Funhof]] and [[Wilm Dedeke]] who survived into the Renaissance period. Hanseatic artists painted commissions for Baltic cities in [[Scandinavia]] and the modern [[Baltic states]] to the east. In the south, the [[Master of the Bamberg Altar]] is the first significant painter based in [[Nuremberg]], while the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]] and then [[Michael Pacher]] worked in Austria. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Like that of Pacher, the workshop of [[Bernt Notke]], a painter from the Hanseatic city of [[Lübeck]], both painted [[altarpiece]]s or carved them in the increasingly elaborate painted and gilded style used as frameworks or alternatives for painted panels.  South German wood sculpture was important in developing new subjects that reflected the intensely emotional devotional life encouraged by movements in late medieval Catholicism such as [[German mysticism]].  These are often known in English as [[andachtsbilder]] (devotional images) and include the ''[[Pietà]]'', ''[[Pensive Christ]]'', ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'', ''[[Arma Christi]]'', ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], and the ''[[Virgin of Sorrows]]'', many of which would spread across Europe and remain popular until the Baroque and, in popular religious imagery, beyond. Indeed "Late Gothic Baroque" is a term sometimes used to describe hyper-decorated and emotional 15th-century art, above all in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Schongauer]], who worked in Alsace in the last part of the 15th century, was the culmination of late Gothic German painting, with a sophisticated and harmonious style, but he increasingly spent his time producing engravings, for which national and international channels of distribution had developed, so that his [[old master print|prints]] were known in Italy and other countries. His predecessors were the [[Master of the Playing Cards]] and [[Master E. S.]], both also from the Upper Rhine region.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chapters IV (painters to 1425), VII (painters to 1500), XIV (printmakers), &amp; XV (sculpture).&lt;/ref&gt;  German conservatism is shown in the late use of gold backgrounds, still used by many artists well into the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 178–181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance painting and prints==
[[File:HMF Duerer Gruenewald Harrich Heller-Altar DSC 6312.jpg|thumb|The Heller altar by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The concept of the [[Northern Renaissance]] or [[German Renaissance]] is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting [[printing]] with [[movable type]], a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was [[Global spread of the printing press|first brought to most of Europe]], including France and Italy, by Germans. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Printmaking]] by [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] (perhaps another German invention) was already more developed in Germany and the [[Low Countries]] than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, [[Albrecht Dürer]], began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of [[Michael Wolgemut]], who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Dürer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], published by his godfather [[Anton Koberger]], Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002&gt;Bartrum (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 

After completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Dürer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Dürer supported [[Martin Luther]] but continued to create [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002/&gt; 
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 022.jpg|The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ|right|thumb|''The [[Crucifixion]]'', central panel of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]].|left]]

Dürer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. [[Martin Luther]] had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of "Lutheran altarpieces", mostly showing the [[Last Supper]], some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the [[Twelve Apostles]]. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely [[aniconic]] influence of [[Calvinism]], and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Part III, Ch. XIX on Cranach, Luther etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying somewhat outside these developments is [[Matthias Grünewald]], who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'' (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged [[triptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 007.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c.1480–1538), ''Danube landscape near Regensburg'' c. 1528, one of the earliest Western pure landscapes, from the [[Danube School]] in southern [[Germany]].]]

The [[Danube School]] is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in [[Bavaria]] and Austria, including [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent [[landscape art]] in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 9 – this is the main subject of the whole book&lt;/ref&gt;  Their religious paintings had an [[expressionist]] style somewhat similar to Grünewald's. Dürer's pupils [[Hans Burgkmair]] and [[Hans Baldung Grien]] worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of [[witch]]es in a number of enigmatic prints.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII, Bartrum, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Holbein the Elder]] and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' relate to the works of the [[Little Masters]], a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XX on the Holbeins, Bartrum (1995), 221–237 on Holbein's prints, 99–129 on the Little Masters&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Dürer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of [[Northern Mannerism]], which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. [[Hans von Aachen]] and the Netherlandish [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in [[Vienna]] and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish [[Sadeler family]] of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Levey&lt;/ref&gt; This style was continued for another generation by [[Bartholomeus Strobel]], an example of an essentially German artist born and working in [[Silesia]], in today's [[Poland]], until he emigrated to escape the [[Thirty Years War]] and become painter at the Polish court. [[Adam Elsheimer]], the most influential German artist in the 17th century, spent his whole mature career in Italy, where he began by working for another émigré [[Hans Rottenhammer]]. Both produced highly finished [[cabinet painting]]s, mostly on copper, with classical themes and landscape backgrounds. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Sculpture==
[[File:Steinhausen Kapitell-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wessobrunner School|Wessobrunner]] [[stucco]] at [[Schussenried Abbey]]]]

In Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. [[Veit Stoss]] (d. 1533), [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] (d.1531) and [[Peter Vischer the Elder]] (d. 1529) were Dürer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 298–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and a half centuries later, [[Johann Joseph Christian]] and [[Ignaz Günther]] were leading masters in the late Baroque period, both dying in the late 1770s, barely a decade before the [[French Revolution]]. A vital element in the effect of German Baroque interiors was the work of the [[Wessobrunner School]], a later term for the [[stucco]]ists of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Another manifestation of German sculptural skill was in [[porcelain]]; the most famous modeller is [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] of the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] factory in Dresden, but the best work of [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in [[Munich]] is often considered the greatest achievement of 18th-century porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th to 19th-century painting==

===Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism===
[[File:Johann Liss 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fall of [[Phaethon|Phaeton]]'' by [[Johann Liss]].]]
[[File:Christian Gottlieb Schick 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gottlieb Schick]], ''Frau von Cotta'', 1802]]

[[Baroque painting]] was slow to arrive in Germany, with very little before about 1650, but once established seems to have suited German taste well.  [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods saw German art producing mostly works derivative of developments elsewhere, though numbers of skilled artists in various genres were active.  The period remains little-known outside Germany, and though it "never made any claim to be among the great schools of painting", its neglect by non-German art history remains striking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24 (quotation), and Scheyer, 9 (from 1960, but the point remains valid)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many distinguished foreign painters spent periods working in Germany for princes, among them [[Bernardo Bellotto]] in [[Dresden]] and elsewhere, and [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], who spent three years painting the [[Würzburg Residence]] with [[Domenico Tiepolo|his son]]. Many German painters worked abroad, including [[Johann Liss]] who worked mainly in [[Venice]], [[Joachim von Sandrart]] and [[Ludolf Bakhuisen]], the leading marine artist of the final years of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]. In the late 18th century the portraitist [[Heinrich Füger]] and his pupil [[Johann Peter Krafft]], whose best known works are three large murals in the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]], had both moved to Vienna as students and stayed there.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62–65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoclassicism]] appears rather earlier in Germany than in France, with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] (1728–79), the Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] (1754–98), and the sculptor [[Gottfried Schadow]] (1764–1850).  Mengs was one of the most highly regarded artists of his day, working in Rome, Madrid and elsewhere, and finding an early [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style that now seems rather effete, although his portraits are more effective.  Carstens' shorter career was turbulent and troubled, leaving a trail of unfinished works, but through pupils and friends such as [[Gottlieb Schick]], [[Joseph Anton Koch]] and [[Bonaventura Genelli]], more influential.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Koch was born in the mountains of the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and became the leading Continental painter of [[landscape art|landscapes]], concentrating on mountain views, despite spending much of his career in Rome. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Daniel Chodowiecki]] was born in [[Danzig]], and at least partly identified as Polish, although he only spoke German and French. His paintings and hundreds of prints, book illustrations and political cartoons are an invaluable visual record of the everyday life and the increasingly complex mentality of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Germany, and its emerging [[Nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 50–68, Novotny, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Anton Graff]] was a prolific portraitist in Dresden, who painted literary figures as well as the court. The [[Tischbein family]] dynasty were solid all-rounders who covered most of the 18th century between them, as did the [[Zick]] family, initially mainly painters of grand Baroque ceilings, who were still active in the 20th century in the person of the illustrator [[Alexander Zick]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Asam brothers]], and [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann|his brother]], were able between them to provide a complete service for commissions for churches and palaces, designing the building and executing the stucco and wall-paintings.  The combined effect of all the elements of these buildings in South Germany, Austria and [[Bohemia]], especially their interiors, represent some of the most complete and extreme realizations of the Baroque aspiration to overwhelm the viewer with the "radiant fairy world of the nobleman's dwelling", or the "foretaste of the glories of Paradise" in the case of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 352–357; quotes from pp. 355 &amp; 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest German [[academy]] was the [[Akademie der Künste]] founded in [[Berlin]] in 1696, and through the next two centuries a number of other cities established their own institutions, in parallel with developments in other European nations. In Germany the uncertain market for art in a country divided into a multitude of small states meant that significant German artists have been to the present day more likely to accept teaching posts in the academies and their successor institutions than their equivalents in England or France have been. In general German academies imposed a particular style less rigidly than was for long the case in Paris,  London, Moscow or elsewhere. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Writing about art===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'' (1818)]]

The Enlightenment period saw German writers becoming leading theorists and critics of art, led by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], who exalted [[Ancient Greek art]] and, despite never visiting Greece or actually seeing many Ancient Greek statues, set out an analysis distinguishing between the main periods of Ancient Greek art, and relating them to wider historical movements.  Winckelmann's work marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture; he was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. Goethe had tried to train as an artist, and his landscape sketches show "occasional flashes of emotion in the presence of nature which are quite isolated in the period".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 78 (quotation); and see index for Winckelmann etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''.  In the following century, German universities were the first to teach art history as an academic subject, beginning the leading position that Germany (and Austria) was to occupy in the study of [[art history]] until the dispersal of scholars abroad in the Nazi period.  [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] championed what he identified in the Gothic and Dürer as specifically Germanic styles, beginning an argument over the proper models for a German artist against the so-called "Tyranny of Greece over Germany" that would last nearly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The rhetorical phrase was coined, or popularized, by: [[E. M. Butler|Butler, Eliza M.]], "The Tyranny of Greece over Germany: a study of the influence exercised by Greek art and poetry over the great German writers of the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries" (Cambridge Univ. Press, London, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism and the Nazarenes===
[[German Romanticism]] saw a revival of innovation and distinctiveness in German art. Outside Germany only [[Caspar David Friedrich]] is well-known, but there were a number of artists with very individual styles, notably [[Philipp Otto Runge]], who like Friedrich had trained at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Copenhagen Academy]] and was forgotten after his death until a revival in the 20th century.  Friedrich painted almost entirely landscapes, with a distinctive Northern feel, and always a feeling of quasi-religious stillness.  Often his figures are seen from behind – they like the viewer are lost in contemplation of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge's portraits, mostly of his own circle, are naturalistic except for his huge-faced children, but the other works in his brief career increasingly reflected a visionary [[pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 106–112&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adrian Ludwig Richter]] is mainly remembered for his portraits, and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carl_Wilhelm_Kolbe_d._%C3%84. Carl Wilhelm Kolbe] was purely an [[etcher]] (as well as a [[philologist]]), whose later prints show figures almost swallowed up by gigantic vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey, 112–122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Overbeck 008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] of the [[Nazarene movement]], ''Italia und Germania''.]]

The [[Nazarene movement]], the coinage of a mocking critic, denotes a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art which embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. Their programme was not dissimilar to that of the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in the 1850s, although the core group took it as far as wearing special pseudo-medieval clothing.  In 1810 [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]], [[Franz Pforr]], [[Ludwig Vogel]] and the Swiss Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to [[Rome]], where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by [[Philipp Veit]], [[Peter von Cornelius]], [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]] and a loose grouping of other German artists. They met up with the Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch, (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by [[Joseph von Führich]], and [[Eberhard Wächter (painter)|Eberhard Wächter]] was later associated with the group.  Unlike the strong support given to the Pre-Raphaelites by the dominant art critic of the day, [[John Ruskin]], Goethe was dismissive of the Nazarenes: "This the first case in the history of art when real talents have taken the fancy to form themselves backwards by retreating into their mother's womb, and thus found a new epoch in art."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24–25 and ''passim'', quotation from p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the Nazarene Schadow, son of the sculptor, the [[Düsseldorf school]] was a group of artists who painted mostly landscapes, and who studied at, or were influenced by the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Academy]], founded in 1767. The academy's influence grew in the 1830s and 1840s, and it had many American students, several of whom became associated with the [[Hudson River School]].&lt;ref&gt;John K. Howat: American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, S. 311&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ritratto della famiglia Begas.jpg|thumb|The family of the painter [[Carl Begas]], 1808, celebrating domesticity in [[Biedermeier]] style]]

===Naturalism and beyond===
[[Biedermeier]] refers to a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848.  Biedermeier art appealed to the prosperous middle classes by detailed but polished [[realism (arts)|realism]], often celebrating domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning aristocratic tastes, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. [[Carl Spitzweg]] was a leading German artist in the style.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Margaret, in ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850, Volume 1'',

In the second half of the 19th century a number of styles developed, paralleling trends in other European counties, though the lack of a dominant capital city probably contributed to even more diversity of styles than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolph Menzel]] enjoyed enormous popularity both among the German public and officialdom; at his funeral [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] walked behind his coffin. He dramaticised past and contemporary [[Prussia]]n military successes both in paintings and brilliant [[wood engraving]]s illustrating books, yet his domestic subjects are intimate and touching. He followed the development of early [[Impressionism]] to create a style that he used for depicting grand public occasions, among other subjects like his ''[[Studio Wall]]''. [[Karl von Piloty]] was a leading [[academic art|academic]] painter of history subjects in the latter part of the century who taught [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|in Munich]]; among his more famous pupils were [[Hans Makart]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Defregger]], [[Gabriel von Max]] and [[Eduard von Grützner]]. The term "Munich school" is used both of German [[Munich School|and of Greek painting]], after Greeks like [[Georgios Jakobides]] studied under him. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Berlin Secession]] was a group founded in 1898 by painters including [[Max Liebermann]], who broadly shared the artistic approach of [[Manet]] and the French [[Impressionist]]s, and [[Lovis Corinth]] then still painting in a naturalistic style.  The group survived until the 1930s, despite splits, and its regular exhibitions helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists, without imposing a particular style.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 181–184, and see index for later mentions&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of the century, the [[Benedictine]] [[Beuron Art School]] developed a style, mostly for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with a [[medievalist]] interest in pattern that drew from [[Les Nabis]] and in some ways looked forward to [[Art Nouveau]] or the Jugendstil ("Youth Style") as it is known in German.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz von Stuck]] and [[Max Klinger]] are the leading German [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painters. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==20th century==
[[File:Franz Marc 020.jpg|thumb|''Rehe im Walde'' ("[[Roe deer]] in the forest") by [[Franz Marc]]]]
Even more than in other countries, German art in the early 20th century developed through a number of loose groups and movements, many covering other artistic media as well, and often with a specific political element, as with the [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] and [[November Group (German)|November Group]], both formed in 1918. In 1922 The November Group, the Dresden Secession, Das Junge Rheinland, and several other progressive groups formed a "Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland) in an effort to gain exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, Dennis (1999). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&amp;pg=PA76 German Post-Expressionism : The Art of the Great Disorder 1918–1924]''. University Park, Pa: Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 76. {{ISBN|0271043164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] ("The Bridge") was one of two groups of German painters fundamental to [[German expressionism|expressionism]], the other being [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group. Die Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905 by architecture students who wanted to be painters: [[Fritz Bleyl]] (1880–1966), [[Erich Heckel]] (1883–1970), [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] (1880–1938) and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]] (1884–1976), with [[Max Pechstein]] and others later joining.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 197–204, and Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriously individualistic [[Emil Nolde]] (1867–1956) was briefly a member of Die Brücke, but was at odds with the younger members of the group.&lt;!-- will expand --&gt; Die Brücke moved to Berlin in 1911, where it eventually dissolved in 1913. Perhaps their most important contribution had been the rediscovery of the [[woodcut]] as a valid medium for original artistic expression. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] ("The Blue Rider") formed in [[Munich]], Germany in 1911. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Marianne von Werefkin]] and others founded the group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue Künstlervereinigung—another artists' group of which Kandinsky had been a member. The name Der Blaue Reiter derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality—the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter (see illustration) in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576, and Hamilton, 215–221&lt;/ref&gt; The intense sculpture and printmaking of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was strongly influenced by [[Expressionism]], which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Brücke'' and ''Der Blaue Reiter'' were both examples of tendency of early 20th-century German art to be "honest, direct, and spiritually engaged"&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in how the two groups attempted this were telling, however. The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction. Still, it was the spiritual and symbolic properties of abstract form that were important. There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: "We have before us an age of conscious creation, and this new spirit in painting is going hand in hand with thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. Hunter et al p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; ''Die Brücke'' also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- "Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us".&lt;ref&gt;From the Manifesto of Die Brücke, qtd Hunter et al p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bauhaus]] also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) with a view towards creating a better society. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Weimar period===

A major feature of German art in the early 20th century until 1933 was a boom in the production of works of art of a [[grotesque]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esti Sheinberg]] (2000) ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Dmitrii Shostakovich'', pp.248–9, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Kort]] (2004) ''Comic Grotesque'', Prestel Publishing {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists using the [[Satirical]]-[[Grotesque]] genre included [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]] and [[Max Beckmann]], at least in their works of the 1920s. [[Dada]] in Germany, the leading practitioners of which were [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Hannah Höch]], was centered in Berlin, where it tended to be more politically oriented than Dada groups elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada"&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) pp. 173–77&lt;/ref&gt; They made important contributions to the development of collage as a medium for political commentary- Schwitters later developed his ''Merzbau'', a forerunner of installation art.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada" /&gt; Dix and Grosz were also associated with the Berlin Dada group. [[Max Ernst]] led a [[Dada]] group in Cologne, where he also practiced collage, but with a greater interest in Gothic fantasy than in overt political content&amp;mdash;this hastened his transition into [[surrealism]], of which he became the leading German practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 473–478&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others experimented with [[cubism]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[New Objectivity]], or Neue Sachlichkeit (new matter-of-factness), was an art movement which arose in Germany during the 1920s as an outgrowth of, and in opposition to, expressionism. It is thus post-expressionist and applied to works of visual art as well as literature, music, and architecture. It describes the stripped-down, simplified building style of the [[Bauhaus]] and the [[Weissenhof Settlement]], the urban planning and public housing projects of [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Ernst May]], and the industrialization of the household typified by the [[Frankfurt kitchen]]. Grosz and Dix were leading figures, forming the "Verist" side of the movement with Beckmann and [[Christian Schad]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Georg Scholz]] (in his early work), [[Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler]], and [[Karl Hubbuch]]. The other tendency is sometimes called [[Magic Realism]], and included [[Anton Räderscheidt]], [[Georg Schrimpf]], [[Alexander Kanoldt]], and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Unlike some of the other groupings, the Neue Sachlichkeit was never a formal group, and its artists were associated with other groups; the term was invented by a sympathetic curator, and "Magic Realism" by an art critic.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 478–479&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plakatstil]], "poster style" in German, was an early style of [[poster]] design that began in the early 20th century, using bold, straight fonts with very simple designs, in contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] posters. [[Lucian Bernhard]] was a leading figure. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Art in the Third Reich===
[[File:Made in Germany by George Grosz 1920.jpg|thumb|''Made in Germany'' ({{lang-de|Den macht uns keiner nach}}), by [[George Grosz]], drawn in pen 1919, photo-lithograph 1920.]]
{{Main|Nazi art}}

The Nazi regime banned [[modern art]], which they condemned as [[degenerate art]] (from the German: entartete Kunst). According to Nazi ideology, modern art deviated from the prescribed norm of [[classical beauty]]. While the 1920s to 1940s are considered the heyday of modern art movements, there were conflicting nationalistic movements that resented abstract art, and Germany was no exception. Avant-garde German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to the German nation.  Many went into exile, with relatively few returning after World War II.  Dix was one who remained, being conscripted into the [[Volkssturm]] Home Guard militia; Pechstein kept his head down in rural [[Pomerania]]. Nolde also stayed, creating his "unpainted pictures" in secret after being forbidden to paint. Beckmann, Ernst, Grosz, Feininger and others went to America, Klee to Switzerland, where he died. Kirchner committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|url = http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kirchner-ernst-ludwig.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 1937, the Nazis mounted a polemical exhibition entitled ''Entartete Kunst'' ([[Degenerate art]]), in Munich; it subsequently travelled to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. The show was intended as an official condemnation of modern art, and included over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums. Expressionism, which had its origins in Germany, had the largest proportion of paintings represented. Simultaneously, and with much pageantry, the Nazis presented the ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung'' (Great German art exhibition) at the palatial ''Haus der deutschen Kunst'' (House of German Art). This exhibition displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 486–487&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into [[Socialist realism]] , [[Neo-expressionism]] and [[Conceptual art|Conceptualism]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Berlín, Friedrichshein, Café Moskau.jpg|thumb]]
Notable socialist realism include or included [[Walter Womacka]], [[Willi Sitte]], [[Werner Tübke]] and [[Bernhard Heiliger|Bernhard Heisig]].

Especially notable neo-expressionists include or included [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Jörg Immendorff]], [[A. R. Penck]], [[Markus Lüpertz]], [[Peter Robert Keil]] and [[Rainer Fetting]]. Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], and [[Neo Rauch]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Performance art]]ist, sculptor, and theorist [[Joseph Beuys]] was perhaps the most influential German artist of the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/306 Moma Focus], retrieved 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to theory was the expansion of the [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] to include the whole of society, as expressed by his famous expression "Everyone is an artist". This expanded concept of art, known as [[social sculpture]], defines everything that contributes creatively to society as artistic in nature. The form this took in his oeuvre  varied from richly metaphoric, almost shamanistic performances based on his personal mythology (''[[Joseph Beuys#.22How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare.22 .28performance.2C 1965.29|How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'', ''[[Joseph Beuys#.22I Like America and America Likes Me.22 .28performance.2C 1974.29|I Like America and America Likes Me]]'') to more direct and utilitarian expressions, such as [[7000 Oaks]] and his activities in the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green party]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The art group [[Gruppe SPUR]] included: [[Lothar Fischer]] (1933–2004), [[Heimrad Prem]] (1934–1978), [[Hans-Peter Zimmer]] (1936–1992) and [[Helmut Sturm]] (1932). The SPUR-artists met first at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and, before falling out with them, were associated with the [[Situationist International]]. Other groups include the [[Junge Wilde]] of the late 1970s to early 1980s. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''''Hairspray''''' is a 1988 American [[Dance in film|dance]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[John Waters]], and starring [[Ricki Lake]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Sonny Bono]], [[Jerry Stiller]], Leslie Ann Powers, [[Vitamin C (singer)|Colleen Fitzpatrick]], and [[Michael St. Gerard]]. ''Hairspray'' was a dramatic departure from Waters's earlier works, with a much broader intended audience. ''Hairspray''{{'}}s [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG]] is the mildest rating a Waters film has received; most of his previous films were rated [[X rating|X]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].&lt;!--The NC-17 rating did not exist until the 1990s. Waters' early films were rated X.--&gt; Set in 1962 [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the film revolves around self-proclaimed "pleasantly plump" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against [[racial segregation]].

''Hairspray'' was only a moderate success upon its initial theatrical release, earning a modest gross of $8 million. However, it managed to attract a larger audience on [[home video]] in the early 1990s and became a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hairspray.htm|title=Hairspray (1988)|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hairspray'' at [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1009096-hairspray/ Rotten Tomatoes]; last accessed May 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics praised the film, although some were displeased{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} with the overall [[Camp (style)|campiness]]. The film ranks #444 on [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]]'s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/11.asp |title=Empire Features The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |website=Empireonline.com |accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the film was adapted into a [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]], which won eight [[Tony Award]]s, including [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] in 2003. A [[Hairspray (2007 film)|second film version]] of ''Hairspray'', an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the stage musical, was also released by [[New Line Cinema]] in 2007, which included many changes of scripted items from the original.

==Plot==
In Baltimore, Maryland in the year 1962, Tracy Turnblad and her best friend, Penny Pingleton, audition for ''The Corny Collins Show'', a popular [[Baltimore]] teenage dance show (based on the real-life ''[[The Buddy Deane Show|Buddy Deane Show]]''). Penny is too nervous and stumbles over her answers, and another girl, Nadine, is cut for being black (the show has a "Negro Day" on the last Thursday of every month, she is told). However, despite being overweight, Tracy is a strong enough dancer to become a regular on the show, infuriating the show's reigning queen, Amber Von Tussle, a mean, privileged, beautiful high school classmate whose racist parents, Velma and Franklin Von Tussle, own Tilted Acres Amusement Park and have banned African Americans from going there. Tracy steals Amber's boyfriend, Link Larkin, and competes against her for the title of Miss Auto Show 1963, fueling Amber's hatred of her.

Tracy's growing confidence leads to her being hired as a plus-size model for the Hefty Hideaway clothing store owned by Mr. Pinky. She is also inspired to bleach, tease, and rat her [[big hair]] into styles popular in the 1960s. At school, a teacher brands her hairdo a "hair-don't" and sends her to the principal's office, from which Tracy is sent to [[special education]] classes, where she meets several black classmates who have been put there to hold them back academically. The students introduce Tracy to Motormouth Maybelle, an [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] record shop owner and host of the monthly "Negro Day" on ''The Corny Collins Show''. They teach Tracy, Penny, and Link dance moves and Penny begins an [[Interracial relationship|interracial romance]] with Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed. This horrifies Penny's parents, Prudence and Paddy, who imprison their daughter in her bedroom and try to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] her into dating white boys and oppose integration with the help of Dr. Frederickson, a [[quackery|quack]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. Seaweed later helps her break out of the house and run away. It is implied that she will never return, as she has finally broken free from her parents.

Undeterred, Tracy uses her newfound fame to champion the cause of [[racial integration]] with the help of Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, his assistant Tammy, and her own [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]], slightly overbearing, overweight mother, Edna. After a [[race riot]] at Tilted Acres results in Tracy's arrest, the Von Tussles grow more defiant in their opposition to racial integration. They plot to sabotage the Miss Auto Show 1963 pageant with a bomb hidden in Velma's towering bouffant wig. The plan literally blows up in Velma's face when the bomb detonates prematurely, and the Von Tussles are dragged away by the Baltimore police. Tracy, who had won the crown but was disqualified for being in reform school, dethrones Amber after the governor of Maryland pardons her; Tracy then shows up at the pageant, integrates the show, and encourages everyone to dance.

==Production==
[[John Waters]] wrote the screenplay under the title of ''White Lipstick'', with the story loosely based on real events. The ''Corny Collins Show'' is based on the real-life ''[[The Buddy Deane Show|Buddy Deane Show]]'', a local dance party program which pre-empted Dick Clark's ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in the Baltimore area during the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name="DVD Commentary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hairspray-Sonny-Bono/dp/B00006RZ9Y|title='Hairspray' DVD Commentary by: John Waters and Ricki Lake|author=[[John Waters]]; [[Ricki Lake]]|date=November 5, 2002|work=[[New Line Cinema|New Line Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters had previously written about ''The Buddy Deane Show'' in his 1983 book ''Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters.''

[[Principal photography]] took place in and around the Baltimore area during the summer of 1987.&lt;ref name="LBH"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Maier]]|date=2011|title=Low Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|url=|location=Davidson, North Carolina, U.S.A.|publisher=Full Page Publishing|pages=273–297|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school scenes were filmed at [[Perry Hall High School]] with set locations including the library, a first-floor English class, and the principal's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcpl.info/info/history/hist_pe_schools.html |title=Perry Hall's Schools: The Heart of the Community |author=David Marks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101004408/http://www.bcpl.info/info/history/hist_pe_schools.html |archivedate=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the scene set in the principal's office, the Harry Dorsey Gough (see [[Perry Hall Mansion]]) coat-of-arms that once hung in the main lobby can be seen through the doorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perryhallmaryland.org/funfacts|title=Fun Facts About Perry Hall|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709085526/http://www.perryhallmaryland.org/funfacts|archivedate=2009-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes set at Tilted Acres amusement park were filmed at [[Dorney Park]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

The film was [[Divine (performer)|Divine]]'s final film; he died three weeks after the film's release. ''Hairspray'' was his only film with Waters in which he didn't play the lead.  Originally, Divine was considered to play both Tracy Turnblad and her mother Edna.  Executives from New Line Cinema, the film's distributor, discouraged this concept, and it was eventually dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=James|title=John Waters: Interviews|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781617031823|pages=xxiii|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Divine played Edna Turnblad and Arvin Hodgepile, racist TV station owner.

===Deleted scenes===
A handful of [[Deleted scene|scenes were cut]] while in post-production, some of which explained certain elements seen in the film.

The first scene occurs before Tracy and Penny go the Parkville VFW record hop.  Tracy is required to start her first shift working in the Hardy-Har Joke Shop. But after managing to scare away all her customers she is excused to go to the hop. The joke shop customers are still listed in the end credits of the final cut.

Another involves Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes from the Etta Gown Shop, and breaking into the Von Tussles' home, using Amber's hair bleach to bleach her hair in  Amber's sink, thus explaining Tracy's change of hair color later in the film.&lt;ref name="DVD Commentary"/&gt;

Another deleted scene involved live roaches crawling out of Tracy's hair at Tilted Acres. The actual filmed scene of the cockroach crawling out of Tracy's hair is cut, but still included is Amber's horrified reaction.  However, she is presumed to be joking and/or lying. When discussing his decision to ultimately cut the scene, Waters explained "[[Robert Shaye|Bob Shaye]], the head of New Line, probably correctly, said, 'This doesn't work. What is this, a [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]] movie?' [...] And he was probably right."&lt;ref name="DVD Commentary"/&gt;

A further excised scene sees Penny and Seaweed trying to take refuge at Nadine's home after Penny's escape.

The final deleted scene was a musical number which involved the teens performing an obscure 1960s dance called "The Stupidity" at the auto show just prior to Tracy being released from reform school, but again, Waters ultimately decided it wasn't appropriate, stating, "[B]asically, I thought, you know, you don't want your leading man to look stupid right in the big finale."&lt;ref name="DVD Commentary"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Hairspray'' received three stars from critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hairspray-1988 | work=RogerEbert.com | title=Hairspray |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=February 26, 1988 |accessdate= April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Waters' second-highest-rated film (behind ''[[Multiple Maniacs]]'') on the website. The critical consensus states that "''Hairspray'' is perhaps John Waters' most accessible film, and as such, it's a gently subversive slice of retro hilarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|1009096-hairspray|Hairspray}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Waters wrote that his all-time favorite review of ''Hairspray'' was [[David Edelstein]]'s in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': "A family movie both the Bradys and the Mansons could adore".&lt;ref name="Waters2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Waters, John|title=Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tr7lYLTXmFYC|accessdate=27 September 2017|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-9124-5|chapter=Finally, Footlights on the Fat Girls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6821">'''Hera Gallery''' is a small, non-profit [[artist cooperative]] in [[Wakefield, Rhode Island]] USA. Created within the context of the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]], Hera Gallery was a pioneer in the genesis of [[artist-run space]]s. Its founding objective in 1974 was to provide a venue for [[women artists]], under-represented at the time in commercial galleries. As the cultural climate changed in the 1980s, the gallery broadened its scope to include visual artists of both genders. Concurrently, Hera curated more topical exhibitions with a broadened spectrum of social awareness and activism. To this day, the gallery provides contemporary artists with the opportunity to address cultural, social, and political issues and to  maintain creative control.

==History==
Hera Gallery was created in 1974, the year that the alternative gallery movement burst beyond major cities and into locations as remote as a village in rural southern Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="Broude 1994 112"&gt;{{cite book | last = Broude | first = Norma | authorlink = |author2=[[Mary D. Garrard]] | title = The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact | publisher = Henry N. Abrams | year = 1994 | location = New York | pages = 112 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8109-3732-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was conceived from a [[consciousness-raising]] group consisting mostly of artists, and often associated with the nearby [[University of Rhode Island]], that started meeting in 1969.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yow | first = Valerie R. |author2=[[Natalie Boymel Kampen]]  | title = The History of Hera: A Women's Art Cooperative, 1974-1989 | publisher = Hera Educational Foundation| year = 1989 | location = Rhode Island | pages = 1–2, 4, 6 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-9625352-0-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the common topics to discuss were the difficulties of balancing the domestic responsibilities of being wife and mother with a professional artistic career.&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History of Hera: A Woman's Art Cooperative, 1974-1989|journal=Woman's Art Journal|year=1991|first=Simpson|last=Pamela H. |volume=12|issue=2|pages=51–2|id= |format=|doi=10.2307/1358294|jstor=1358294|publisher=Woman's Art, Inc.|last2=Yow|first2=Valerie Raleigh|last3=Kampen|first3=Natalie Boymel }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-12-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The women discussed the difficulty in having their work represented in Manhattan galleries, where apparent sexism from gallery owners caused their work to be disregarded.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt; Hera Gallery was thus created in order to foster a professional community of women artists, in the vein of other recently established women-run artist cooperatives,&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"/&gt; such as New York City's [[A.I.R. Gallery]]. At the time, a Providence Journal writer commented that  "...a  women's art center named after a bitchy Greek goddess and housed in a barn that used to be a laundry is New England's only art gallery completely owned and controlled by women..." &lt;ref name="Broude 1994 112"/&gt; 
[[Image:Heragalleryexterior.JPG|thumb|right|Photograph of Hera Gallery's exterior]]

==Organizational structure==
Initially the organization of Hera Gallery consisted of non-hierarchical egalitarian committees, influenced by feminist ideals.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"/&gt; As the gallery grew, its board of directors, once only represented by artist-members, was appended with a community Advisory Board from 1986–2000, according to the gallery's unpublished “Addendum to the History of Hera”. Furthermore, when the Advisory Board was discontinued in 2000, the Board of Directors began including external community members (Addendum). Since 1992 (Addendum) there has also been a Gallery Director part-time paid position.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heragallery.org/pdf/heramembershipguidelines.pdf |title=membership guidelines |accessdate=2007-12-07 |date=May 2000 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018191913/http://www.heragallery.org/pdf/heramembershipguidelines.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hera Gallery offers its members an annual solo exhibition, inclusion in group exhibitions, curatorial opportunities, and positions on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"/&gt; It serves the surrounding community by “encouraging ethnic and cultural diversity in both audience and program development.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"/&gt; ”

==Developments==
Since its inception, Hera Gallery has resided in a building that was a garage in the 1920s, then a laundromat, and later a flea market, before finally being outfitted by the founding artists and their loved ones. Its landlord throughout this time was a sympathetic URI professor who kept the rent low for them.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt; After his recent demise, the family put the land on the market but waited for a buyer whose plan included preserving the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Schieldrop | title=Mixed use explored for Hera’s, Phil’s | date=2006-09-22 | publisher= | url =http://scindependent.com/articles/2006/09/22/local/astory.txt | work =The South County Independent | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2007 it was announced that a buyer plans on demolishing the existing building to create a [[mixed-use development]] including residential condominiums and inclusion of the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katie | last=Mulvaney | title=Condos slated to replace gallery, diner | date=2007-09-14 | publisher= | url =http://www.projo.com/ri/southkingstown/content/SC_SKHERA_09-14-07_D3746UH.355227d.html | work =The Providence Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Creationism2}}
[[Hinduism]] includes a range of viewpoints about the [[origin of life]], [[creationism]] and [[evolution]]. There is no single story of creation, due to dynamic diversity of Hinduism, and these are derived from various sources like [[Vedas]], some from the [[Brahmana]]s, some from [[Puranas]]; some are philosophical, based on concepts, and others are narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyo.in/variety/hindusim-world-creation-universe-brahma-vishu-shiva/story/1/19522.html|title=How did the world come into being according to Hinduism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda]] mentions the ''[[Hiranyagarbha]]'' ("golden embryo") as the source of the creation of the Universe, similar to the [[world egg]] motif found in the [[creation myth]]s of many other civilizations. It also contains a myth of  [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origin, in which the creation arises out of the [[dismemberment]] of a cosmic being (the [[Purusha]]) who is sacrificed by the gods.&lt;ref name="Jan2007"/&gt; As for the creation of the primordial gods themselves, the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of Rigveda takes a near-[[agnostic]] stand, stating that the Gods came into being after the world's creation, and nobody knows when the world first came into being.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Ralph T.H. (Transl.): [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10129.htm Rigveda Hymn CXXIX. Creation] in Hymns of the Rgveda, Vol. II, 1889-92. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the later [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts, the creator god [[Brahma]] is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe'. Some texts consider him equivalent to the Hiranyagarbha or the Purusha, while others state that he arose out of these. Brahma is a part of the [[trimurti|trinity]] of gods that also includes [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], who are responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively. 

Many Hindu texts mention the [[Hindu cosmology|cycle of creation and destruction]]. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] states that the current human generation descends from [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the only man who survived a [[flood myth|great deluge]] after being warned by the God. This legend is comparable to the other [[List of flood myths|flood legends]], such as the story of the [[Noah's Ark]] mentioned in the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="Sunil1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sunil Sehgal | title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism: C-G | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWG64bgtf3sC&amp;pg=PA401 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | year=1999 | publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons | isbn=978-81-7625-064-1 | page=401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of Victorian England opposed the idea of Darwinism. Hindus already had present notion of common ancestry between humans and animals.

== Hindu creationism ==

According to [[Hindu]] [[creationism]] all [[species]] on earth including [[humans]] have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]]. Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;Science &amp; Religion: A New Introduction, Alister E. McGrath, 2009, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;The creationists: from scientific creationism to intelligent design, Ronald L. Numbers, 2006, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of [[old earth creationism]]. According to Hindu creationists the [[universe]] may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]] which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the [[earth]].&lt;ref&gt;James C. Carper, Thomas C. Hunt, The Praeger Handbook of Religion and Education in the United States: A-L, 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1, Surendranath Dasgupta, 1992, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation myths ===

Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alone in Unity: Torments of an Iraqi God-Seeker in North America | first=Faris | last=Georgis | publisher=Dorrance Publishing | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFZrxLjtiI8C&amp;pg=PA62 | page=62 | isbn=1-4349-0951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Hindu texts]] do not provide a single canonical account of the creation; they mention a range of theories of the creation of the world, some of which are contradictory.&lt;ref name="Robert1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert M.

==== Rigveda ====

The [[Purusha Sukta]] of the earliest Hindu text [[Rigveda]] mentions [[Purusha]], primeval cosmic being.&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=S. N. Sadasivan | title=A Social History Of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be3PCvzf-BYC&amp;pg=PA227 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2000 | publisher=APH Publishing | isbn=978-81-7648-170-0 | pages=226–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purusha is described as all that has ever existed and will ever exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10090.htm|title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda, Book 10: HYMN XC. Puruṣa.|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This being's body was the origin of four different kinds of people: the [[Brahmin]], the [[Kshatriya|Rajanya]], the [[Vaishya]], and the [[Shudra]].&lt;ref name=Tignor2014&gt;"Worlds Together Worlds Apart", Fourth Edition, Beginnings Through the 15th century, Tignor, 2014, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Viraj, variously interpreted as the [[world egg|mundane egg]]&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"/&gt; (see [[Hiranyagarbha]]) or the twofold male-female energy, was born from Purusha, and the Purusha was born again from Viraj. The gods then performed a [[yajna]] with the Purusha, leading to the creation of the other things in the manifested world from his various body parts and his mind. These things included the animals, the Vedas, the [[Varna]]s, the celestial bodies, the air, the sky, the heavens, the earth, the directions, and the Gods [[Indra]] and [[Agni]]. It is likely that this myth has [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origins, as it is similar to other myths found in the Indo-European cultures, in which the creation arises out of the dismemberment of a divine being (cf. [[Ymir]] of the [[Norse mythology]]).&lt;ref name="Jan2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jan N.

The concept of Purusha is similar to the concept of [[Brahman]] described in the later texts.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"&gt;{{cite book | author=Roshen Dalal | title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA318 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=5 October 2011 | publisher=Penguin Books India | isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 | pages=318–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318}} As for the creation of the primordial beings (such as the gods who performed the sacrifice of the Purusha), the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] states:&lt;ref name="McNamaraWildman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick McNamara|author2=Wesley J.

}}

Rigveda (10.121) also mentions the [[Hiranyagarbha]] (literally, golden embryo/womb/[[world egg|egg]]) that existed before the creation. This metaphor has been interpreted differently by the various later texts. The [[Samkhya]] texts state that Purusha and the [[Prakṛti|Prakriti]] made the embryo, from which the world emerged. In another tradition, the creator god [[Brahma]] emerged from the egg and created the world, while in yet another tradition the Brahma himself is the Hiranyagarbha.&lt;ref name="Edward2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Edward Quinn | title=Critical Companion to George Orwell | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZET2sSUVsgC&amp;pg=PA188 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2009 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | isbn=978-1-4381-0873-5 | page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the Purusha, the creation of the gods and other details of the embryo creation myth have been described variously by the later Hindu texts.

The early hymns of Rigveda also mention [[Tvastar]] as the first born creator of the human world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/594460?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101565303097 The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda]" by W. Norman Brown. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 62, No. 2 (Jun., 1942), pp. 85-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting the creation of gods, the Rig Veda does seem to affirm ‘’creatio ex nihilo’’. Rig Veda 10.72 states:
{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

1. LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods,
That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.
2 These Brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith,
Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
3 Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 10.72 translation by R.T.H. Griffith (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] mentions a story of creation, in which the [[Prajapati]] performs [[tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] to reproduce himself. He releases the waters and enters them in the form of an egg that evolves into [[Brahmanda|the cosmos]].&lt;ref name="WhitePollak2010"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Merry I.

With further tapas, he created the devas. He also created the [[asura]]s, and the darkness came into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} It also contains a story similar to the other [[List of flood myths|great flood stories]]. After the great flood, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] the only surviving human, offers a sacrifice from which Ida is born. From her, the existing human race comes into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

==== Upanishads ====

The [[Aitareya Upanishad]] (3.4.1) mentions that only the "[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]" (the Self) existed in the beginning. The Self created the heaven (''Ambhas''), the sky (''Marikis''), the earth (''Mara'') and the underworld (''Ap''). He then formed the Purusha from the water. He also created the speech, the fire, the prana (breath of life), the air and the various senses, the directions, the trees, the mind, the moon and other things.&lt;ref name="MaxMuller2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=F. Max Muller | title=The Upanishads, Vol I | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6VFU0jK7UC&amp;pg=PA228 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=30 June 2004 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4191-8641-7 | pages=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (1.4) mentions that in the beginning, only the Atman existed as the Purusha. Feeling lonely, the Purusha divided itself into two parts: male ("pati") and female ("patni"). The men were born when the male embraced the female. The female thought "how can he embrace me, after having produced me from himself? I shall hide myself." She then became a cow to hide herself, but the male became a bull and embraced her. Thus the cows were born. Similarly, everything that exists in pairs, was created. Next, the Purusha created the fire, the [[soma (drink)|soma]] and the immortal gods (the [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]]) from his better part. He also created the various powers of the gods, the different [[varna in Hinduism|classes]], the [[dharma]] (law or duty) and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15055.htm Fourth Brâhmana] in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Fourth Brahmana. Translated by Max Müller as The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15) [1879].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] states that the being (''sat'') was created from the non-being. The Being later became the ''Atman'' (2.7.1), and then created the worlds (1.1.1).&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} The [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] states that the Brahma creates, sustains and destroys the world.&lt;ref name="ANPrasad2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=S.K.

==== Later texts ====
[[File:An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati.jpg|thumb|350px|left|An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati; a steel engraving from the 1850s]]
Belief in evolution is among the [[Samkhya]] philosophy. In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, evolution is symbolized by the Sanskrit term parinama. Many Hindu reformers compare this term and philosophy with Darwinism. The prominent Vivekananda, based most of his cosmological and biological ideas off of the [[Samkhya]].&lt;ref name="Gosling 345–347-348–353"/&gt;  The [[Samkhya]] texts state that there are two distinct fundamental eternal entities: the Purusha and the [[Prakriti]]. The Prakriti has three [[guṇa|qualities]]: ''[[sattva]]'' (purity or preservation), ''[[rajas]]'' (creation) and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'' (darkness or destruction). When the equilibrium between these qualities gets broken, the act of creation starts. ''Rajas'' quality leads to creation.&lt;ref name="Joshi2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dinkar Joshi | title=Glimpses Of Indian Culture | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fw-0iBvmMAC&amp;pg=PA32 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2005 | publisher=Star Publications | isbn=978-81-7650-190-3 | page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later texts such as the [[Puranas]] identify the Purusha with the [[God in Hinduism|God]]. In many Puranic notes, [[Brahma]] is the creator god.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} However, some Puranas also identify Vishnu, Shiva or Devi as the creator.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

In [[Garuda Purana]], there was nothing in the universe except the [[Brahman]]. The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his hair, sheep from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from feet). His body hair became the herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind, Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa. Kashypata married thirrteen of Daksha's daughter and all the devas and the createures were born through them.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} Other Puranas and the Manu Smriti mention several variations of this theory.

In [[Vishnu Purana]], the Purusha is same as the creator deity [[Brahma]], and is a part of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}} The [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] texts mention the Hiranyagarbha as a creation of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Edward2009"/&gt; According to the [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]] Purusha and Prakriti emerged together and formed the [[Brahman]], the supreme universal spirit that is the origin and support of the universe.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}}

The Advaita Vedanta states that the creation arises from Brahman, but it is illusory and has no reality. (Vivarta)&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{realmente p|103}}

===Hindu cosmological view===

Many Hindu philosophies mention that the [[Hindu cycle of the universe|creation is cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|104}} According to the [[Upanishad]]s, the universe and the Earth, along with humans and other creatures, undergo repeated cycles (''[[pralaya]]'') of creation and destruction. A variety of myths exist regarding the specifics of the process, but in general the Hindu view of the cosmos is as eternal and cyclic. The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. In Hindu cosmology, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 years (one [[day of Brahma]], the creator or ''kalpa'')&lt;ref&gt;A survey of Hinduism, [[Klaus K. Klostermaier]], 2007, pp. 495-496&lt;/ref&gt; and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day. This process, called ''pralaya'' (cataclysm), repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion, 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.

== Modern Interpretations of Scriptural archetypes ==

Most Hindus accept the theory of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; They either regard the scriptural creation theories as allegories and metaphors, or reconcile these legends with the modern theory of evolution.

===Dashavatara===
{{main|Dashavatara#Evolutionary interpretation}}

The order of the [[Dashavatara]] (ten principal [[avatar]]s of the god [[Vishnu]]) is interpreted to convey Darwin's evolution.&lt;ref name="Chandra1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suresh Chandra|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|year=1998|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-039-9|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishna2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nanditha Krishna|title=Sacred Animals of India|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306619-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] opined that they are a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of evolution. Like the evolutionary process itself, the first avatar of God is a fish - [[Matsya]], then comes the aquatic reptile turtle, [[Kurma]], then a mammal - the boar [[Varaha]], then [[Narasimha]], a man-lion being, [[Vamana]], the dwarf then the rest four are humans; Kalki is not yet born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cover Story: Haldane: Life Of A Prodigious Mind | journal=[[Science Reporter]] | year=1992 | volume=29 | pages=46 |publisher=Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various thinkers and authors like [[Helena Blavatsky]],  [[Monier Monier-Williams]], [[Nabinchandra Sen]], [[C. D. Deshmukh]] have associated the Dashavatara with evolution.

===Vanara===
[[File:Building of Rama's Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Hindu epics mention an ape-like humanoid species called the [[vanara]]s.]]

The [[Sanskrit]] epics of the Hindus mention several [[exotic tribes of ancient India|exotic creatures]] including ape-like humanoids.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Trikha, A study of the Ramayana of Valmiki, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindus see this as a proof of the historicity of their mythological characters and as support for the theory of evolution in their texts. The [[Ramayana]] speaks of the [[Vanaras]], an ape-like species with human intelligence, that existed millions of years ago. According to the Ramayana alongside these [[ape-men]] existed [[modern humans]]. Thus, according to these ancient writings, the status of such creatures was a state of coexistence rather than evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tribute to Hinduism: Thoughts and Wisdom Spanning Continents and Time about India and Her Culture|page=386|first=Sushama|last=Londhe|year=2008|quote= For example, the Ramayana speaks of the Vanaras, a species of apelike men that existed millions of years ago.|publisher=Pragun Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Crown of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Szent Korona}},&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-de|Stephanskrone}}, {{lang-hr|Kruna svetoga Stjepana}}, {{lang-la|Sacra Corona}}, {{lang-sk|Svätoštefanská koruna}})&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Crown of [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]]''') was the [[coronation crown]] used by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] for most of its existence; kings have been crowned with it since the twelfth century.
The Crown was bound to the [[Lands of the Hungarian Crown]] (sometimes the ''Sacra Corona'' meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the [[history of Hungary]], more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], in 1916 (the only kings who were not so crowned were [[John II Sigismund]], [[Gabriel Bethlen]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]).

The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in [[Constantinople]] in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] to King [[Géza I of Hungary]]; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier [[Monomachus Crown]], which is also in Budapest, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 214; Bàràny-Oberschall (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins.  The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;László, 425&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian coronation]] insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1310–1342).  In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King [[Stephen I of Hungary]], crowned in 1000/1001.

It was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard [[Péter Révay]]. He also depicts that "the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the [[Ark of the Covenant|Lost Ark]] is for the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]].

==Holiness doctrine==

[[File:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|thumb|The Crown, Sword, Sceptre and [[Globus Cruciger]] of Hungary, in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]
As is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by [[Divine right of kings|Divine Right]]. According to popular tradition, [[Stephen I of Hungary|St Stephen I]] held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the [[Virgin Mary]] to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as ''patrona'' (patron saint) for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] but also as ''regina'' (i.e. "queen"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called "Doctrine of the Holy Crown" ({{lang-hu|Szentkorona-tan}}).

[[Péter Révay]], a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works ''Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona'' (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in [[Augsburg]], 1613) and ''De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae'' (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, [[Frankfurt]], 1659).
At the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown".

According to the most accepted theory, which is represented in the publications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and also of the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference,&lt;ref name='Zombori'&gt;Zombori, I, Cséfalvay, P., Maria Antonietta De Angelis: A Thousand Years of Christianity in Hungary – Hungariae Christianae Millennium – Published by the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference, Budapest, 2001, for the exhibition in the Musea of Vatican, Vatican City, 10 October 2001 – 12 January 2002 – under the auspices of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&lt;/ref&gt; the Holy Crown of Hungary consists of two main parts: "abroncs" (rim, hoop) the ''corona graeca'', and "keresztpántok" (cross straps) the ''corona latina''. It was created during the reign of [[Béla III]] under [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence. (The Hungarian king Béla III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.)
The [[coronation|crowning]] of Stephen I, the first king of [[Hungary]], who was later [[canonization|canonized]] Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001.

One version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop [[Hartvik]] (between 1095–1116), in which the "Pope" has sent King Stephen I "his blessings and a crown". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100-1110 at the request of King [[Könyves Kálmán]]. According to "Hartvik’s legend", St Stephen sent Archbishop [[Astrik]] of [[Esztergom]] to [[Rome]] to ask for or require (both are possible from original [[Latin]] script) a crown from the "[[Pope]]", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the [[Poland|Polish]] prince, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]'s envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: "There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. "Hartvik’s legend" appeared in the [[liturgical book]]s and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Consequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard Péter Révay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the "Greater Legend" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that "in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord’s favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in [[Vatican City]] on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

There is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that [[Otto III]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact.

Beside the two main theories – donation by the pope and creation in the time of Béla III – there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia.

The question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out.

The differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one.

==Type==
The Crown is a [[coronation crown]], which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (koronaőr) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the ''[[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|nádorispán]]'' (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during coronation, and the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|Archbishop of Esztergom]] ([[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king.

==Structure of the crown and its icons==
[[File:SztKoronaEN.jpg|thumb|360px|Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image)]]
The Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel "pantokrator" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning "the master of the universe") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and [[almandine]]. It has three parts: "abroncs" (rim, hoop) (''corona graeca''),  "keresztpántok" (cross straps) (''corona latina''), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked.

There are four hanging pendants ([[pendilia]]) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back.

===Corona graeca===
The "abroncs" (rim, hoop) ''corona graeca'' ("Greek Crown") is 5.2&amp;nbsp;cm wide with a diameter of 20.5&amp;nbsp;cm.

The two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|King Matthias II]] (1608–1619). The enamel picture on the front depicts [[Christ Pantokrator]]. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], followed by half-length images of the Saints [[Saint George|George]] and [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], and [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]].

[[File:Géza I.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian King [[Géza I of Hungary|Géza I]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]

In the arched frame on the back of the diadem [[Michael VII Doukas|Emperor Michael VII Doukas]] (1071–1078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half-length picture of "Kon. Porphyrogennetos", this probably being either Emperor Michael’s brother and co-emperor [[Konstantios Doukas]] or of his son and heir [[Constantine Doukas]], both having been [[Porphyrogenitos|born in the purple]]. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[Géza I]] (1074–1077), with the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription: "ΓΕΩΒΙΤΖΑϹ ΠΙΣΤΟϹ ΚΡΑΛΗϹ ΤΟΥΡΚΙΑϹ" (''Geōbitzas pistós králēs Tourkías'', meaning "[[Géza I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]").&lt;ref name="constantine_vii"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3al15wpFWiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Constantine+VII+Porphyrogenitus+(Emperor+of+the+East)%22&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-eYdUs3tHcSihgfG6YHIAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=De Administrando Imperio by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus|last=Jenkins|first=Romilly James Heald|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|year=1967|isbn=0-88402-021-5|edition=New, revised|series=Corpus fontium historiae Byzantinae|location=Washington, D.C.|page=65|accessdate=28 August 2013}} According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 950 AD) ''"Patzinakia, the [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg realm]], stretches west as far as the [[Siret River]] (or even the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]]), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary)."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterfindley"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=ToAjDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67&amp;dq=khazar+hungary+tourkia&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikypjIuM7cAhXpNpoKHZ5BAfAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazar%20hungary%20tourkia&amp;f=false|title=The Turks in World History|author=Carter Vaughn Findley|page=51|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195177268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="istvanbaan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZDgivj7_RAC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Byzanz und Ostmitteleuropa 950–1453: Beiträge zu einer table-ronde des XIX.

The saints and the Greek rulers have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] while Géza does not. The inscriptions of the emperors’ names are in red, while the Hungarian king’s is in dark blue or black.

The enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.

The corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses&lt;ref&gt;missing&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words it was a woman’s crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King Géza’s wife, known only as [[Synadene]], around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor’s treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to [[Hungary]].&lt;br /&gt;
There is another view that the Géza depicted on the ''corona graeca'' is not King Géza I but [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|St Stephen's father]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gallus, "The structural aspect: towards a plural society", Quest for a new Central Europe, ed. J. Varsányi, 1976, pp. 130-176, at p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince Géza is depicted on the ''corona gracea'' without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre.&lt;ref name="Endrey"&gt;

===Corona Latina===
The "keresztpántok" (cross straps) ''corona latina'' ("Latin Crown") is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2*7.2&amp;nbsp;cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the ''Corona Græca'' and provide a dome-shaped top.

The inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to István I by the pope, or possibly the [[treasure binding]] of a book. It is also possible, although cannot be verified, that István I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his – historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000.

The intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that closes off the lower end of the bands and finishes off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ’s disciples,. (Acts 10.1).

The central panel is decorated with a square cloisonné enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13.

Éva Kovács and Zsuzsa Lovag&lt;ref name="Kovacs"&gt;''Magyar koronazasi jelvenyek'', Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; ''The Hungarian crown and other regalia'' translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the ''corona latina'' was originally a large Byzantine [[liturgical asterisk]] from a Greek monastery in Hungary.  In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the ''Autocrat'', the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit  (see '''Cross''').

===Cross===
[[File:Matthias II of Hungary.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II of Hungary]], showing the cross in vertical position]]

The cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have taken place during the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The cross was knocked crooked in the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.

Éva Kovács suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the [[True Cross]] and that it was this presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy.  She states that “Szabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown’s history which had completely escaped everybody’s attention. Before [[Isabella Jagiellon|Queen Isabella]] handed over the regalia to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown’s peak for her son, John Sigismund.  According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, “ ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it".{{citequote|date = June 2015}}

Later, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II.  This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.”  She also notes that “Several small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty.  As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen.  About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II’s campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king’s property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force.  We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns.  To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV’s crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.”&lt;ref name=Kovacs/&gt;

Later, it was the Crown itself, rather than St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen.  Éva Kovács further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms.  Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic.  This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===The crown as a whole===

The form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the [[kamelaukion]]-type crowns with closed tops introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The use of many pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the corona graeca during the rule of Béla III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the corona graeca was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine crowns.

===Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen===
Beside the using of the intersecting bands of the ''corona latina'', which probably came from the treasury of St. István, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, István.

The inscription embroidered onto the '''coronation mantle''' indicates with all certainty that István I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031.

The '''coronation sceptre''' with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St István. On the seals of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later.

==The regalia in modern times==
[[File:HUF 2000 2000 obverse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Holy Crown on the commemorative 2000 [[Hungarian forint|HUF]] banknote, issued in 2000, the millennium anniversary of the coronation of [[King Saint Stephen]]]]
The Holy Crown has had a lively history, having been stolen, hidden, lost, recovered, and taken abroad many times. During the [[Árpád dynasty]] (1000–1301), the coronation insignia were kept in the coronation city of [[Székesfehérvár]]. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: [[Visegrád]] (in [[Pest county]]); [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or [[Buda]]. In 1805–1806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the castle at [[Mukachevo|Munkács]] (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). [[Lajos Kossuth]] took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near [[Orşova]] in [[Transylvania]] (Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853.

At the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the [[crown jewels]] were recovered in [[Mattsee]], Austria, on 4&amp;nbsp;May 1945 by the [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 86th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/h/hungary.asc|title=Hungary: Recovery of Crown Jewels 1945|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the [[United States Army]] by the [[Hungarian Crown]] Guard for safekeeping from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/museum/crown.phtml|title=Jimmy Carter Library: The Crown of St. Stephen|accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the [[Cold War]] the crown was held at the [[United States Bullion Depository]] ([[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to Hungary by order of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] on 6&amp;nbsp;January 1978. Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels.&lt;ref name='The Gulya Pot'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node/148 |title=The Hungarian Crown |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123521/http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node%2F148 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St stephens crown mukachevo plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque at [[Mukacheve|Munkács]] Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805–1806]]After the fall of [[Communism]], the crown was reincorporated into the [[Coat of arms of Hungary|national coat of arms]] in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] arms of 1849.

==Other coronation regalia==
Uniquely in Europe, most of the medieval ensemble of [[coronation regalia]] has survived. On 1&amp;nbsp;January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] from the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The [[sceptre]], [[globus cruciger|orb]] and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament.

The very large [[coronation]] [[Mantle (royal garment)|mantle]] remains in a glass [[Inert gas#Applications|inert gas vault]] at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her [[sister]]s and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's [[chasuble]].

The sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid [[quartz|rock crystal]] ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century [[Fatimid]] caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments.

The ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product. However, what is said to be an original coronation sword of Stephen I has been in [[Prague]]'s [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] since 1368.&lt;ref&gt;The sword has a walrus-tooth hilt decorated in the [[Mammen style]], dated to the 10th century.

A [[lance]] claimed to have belonged to King Stephen I, and seen in the Mantle portrait, was reportedly obtained by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] circa 1100.

{{for|the film|I Was Monty's Double (film)}}
[[File:IWasMontysDouble.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Rider and Company)]]
'''''I Was Monty's Double''''' (released in the US as '''''The Counterfeit General Montgomery'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1789274884&amp;searchurl=an%3DJAMES%252C%2BM%2BE%2BCLIFTON%26sortby%3D3 AbeBooks: "The Counterfeit General Montgomery" - James, M. E. Clifton] Retrieved 2012-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book by [[M. E. Clifton James]], first published in London in 1954. It was made into [[I Was Monty's Double (film)|a film]] in 1958, directed by [[John Guillermin]], from a screenplay adapted by [[Bryan Forbes]].  It tells the story of [[Operation Copperhead]]: James had an uncanny resemblance to [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery]] in real life, and he was used to impersonate Montgomery to confuse the Germans during the [[Second World War]].

==Film vs book==
The film broadly follows the account by James in his book of the same name, but according to James, there was no attempt to kidnap him. The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place.

Gibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what "Monty" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non-existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously.

==Satires==
* ''[[The Goon Show]]'' broadcast a parody episode entitled [http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/ajwills/raw/series09/s09e02.html ''I Was Monty's Treble''] on 10 November 1958 (9th series, show 2).
* In 1959, [[Cecil Parker]] and [[Leslie Phillips]] appeared in a [[Parody|spoof]] version, ''[[The Night We Dropped a Clanger]]'' (known as ''Make Mine a Double'' in the U.S.), alongside [[Brian Rix]]. 
* The 1961 film ''[[On the Double (film)|On the Double]]'', starring [[Danny Kaye]], was also a take-off of ''I Was Monty's Double'', in which Kaye plays the twin roles of the General and the private who (comically but successfully) impersonates him.
* The 1989 [[Jason Connery]] film ''[[Casablanca Express]]'' freely borrows from the original tale, but with Churchill as the kidnap target. [[Glenn Ford]] appears briefly as a character resembling Gen. Williams.
* British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' carried a spoof version of the [[War Picture Library]] graphic novels entitled "Battle for Britain", a satire on then-current British political issues, most notably the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]].  The author was credited as "Monty Stubble", a [[pun]] on Monty's Double.

Since 2010, the name 'Monty's Double' has been adopted by the actor Colin Brooks-Williams as the identity for his popular Field-Marshal Montgomery lookalike and impersonation act, with which he tours 1940s-themed events nationwide ; as a tribute to the Field-Marshal himself and to M.E.Clifton James (the original war-time 'Monty's Double'). Colin has registered the name 'Monty's Double' as his professional stage name with the actor's union 'Equity' and carries the name on his Equity membership card.

'''''Il Frontespizio''''' (meaning ''The Frontispiece'' in English) was an [[Italian language|Italian]] art and [[literary magazine]], which had a [[Catholicism in Italy|Catholic]] perspective. The magazine existed between 1929 and 1940.

==History and profile==

'''Mary Parker''' (born 1930) is notable for being the first woman to appear on [[Melbourne]] television.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.cam.org.au/News-and-Events/Features/General-Features/Article/14780/Portrait-of-an-artist-Paul-Fitzgerald#.VSb_W_CK8y0 "Constant in Faith"], Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne bulletin, Vol. 24, Issue 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://televisionau.com/classic-tv-guides/tv041156|title=Sunday 4 November 1956 – MELBOURNE|work=televisionau.com|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of three persons to host [[HSV (TV station)|HSV]] Channel 7's test broadcasts prior to their official opening night; the other two test broadscasters being [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce (later Sir Eric Pearce)]] and Danny Webb. On HSV-7's opening night, 4 November 1956, Parker presented the news with Pearce.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Listener In-TV'', 1 November 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this she had worked in England, where she became a well-known stage, screen and television actress.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2440489/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Mary Parker Biography|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everybody in England knew Mary Parker", said her husband, [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]]. "In England she did several films with Sir Douglas Fairbanks Jr – I've seen her name in lights on Shaftsbury Avenue and then she worked on TV as an announcer. They also brought her out to Australia in 1956 to open the (television coverage of the) Olympic Games – she was the first woman on television in (Melbourne)."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary Parker was born on 31 October 1930 in [[Bitton, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; She grew up in Melbourne and attended [[Genazzano FCJ College|Genazzano Convent school]], returning to England to pursue her career until invited back to Melbourne by HSV-7 to be their initial female television personality.

==Family==
She married noted portrait artist [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]] in 1957. They have seven children: Fabian (born 1959), Marisa (born 1960), Patrick (born 1963; now  deceased), Emma (born 1964), Edward (born 1968), Maria (born 1970) and Frances (born 1973). She lives in [[Melbourne]].

==British film career==
* ''[[The Vise]]'' [TV series] (''Kill Me My Love'' 1957, ''The Deception'' 1955, ''Gabriel's Choice'' 1954) ... Irene / Dorothy / Marianne Anderson (opposite fellow Australian [[Ron Randell]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Honor Blackman]] and [[Patrick McGoohan]])
* ''[[The Hostage (1956 film)|The Hostage]]'' (1956) ... Rosa Gonzuelo (lead female role opposite [[Ron Randell]])
* ''[[Colonel March of Scotland Yard]]'' [TV series] (1956) (''Present Tense'' 1957 ... Emily [opposite [[Boris Karloff]]])
* ''[[You Lucky People]]'' (1955) ...  Pvt. Sally Briggs (lead female role, opposite [[Tommy Trinder]] and [[Dora Bryan]])
* ''[[Third Party Risk]]'' (1954) ... Nancy (opposite [[Lloyd Bridges]] and [[Finlay Currie]])
* ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents|Rheingold Theatre – Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]'' [TV series] (''The International Settlement'' 1954, ''The Trap'' 1954) ... Elizabeth / Peggy.

==Australian television career==
In the 1950s it was usual to have a host ''top and tail'' the various programs and Mary Parker had that role in the early days of HSV-7.

She also presented the following programs:
* ''[[Beauty is My Business]]'' 
* ''[[Eric and Mary]]'' (with [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce]])
* ''[[Guest of the Week]]''
* ''[[The Judy Jack Show]]'' (covered when the regular hostess was indisposed)

In an interview with Parker in May 2015, she explained that she was also one of the first pianists on HSV-7, playing as preludes to a couple of her regular series of interviews. She started an interview with Des Bradley (violinist) by accompanying him in a rendition of [[Saint Saëns]]'s The Swan. Another interview was with [[Freddy Cole]] and started with a piano duet between Cole and Parker; this must have looked interesting to viewers because of the black and white hands on the keyboard.

Parker shares the honour of being among the first women on Australian television with [[Babs McKinnon]] the first woman on Sydney television when [[Nine Network|TCN-9]] was opened on 16 September 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcnchannel9.com/197149937|title=THE EARLY DAYS - www.tcnchannel9.com|work=SimpleSite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne, on HSV-7's opening night, singer [[Toni Lamond]] appeared in a variety program.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">The '''Minneapolis Arts Commission''' is the [[arts council]] for the city of [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota in the United States. It was established in 1974. The 17 volunteer commissioners are appointed by the mayor and city council. The commission's role includes finding support for the arts from both public and private sources.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Minneapolis Arts Commission |url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/dca/mac/dca_art_commission_history |publisher=City of Minneapolis, MN |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the mid 1970s the Arts Commission looked for a project to provide space for arts activities in an area the city wanted to redevelop economically. They received a grant from the Design Arts program of [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to fund a feasibility study for converting the historic Masonic Temple into an arts center. The result was the opening of the [[Hennepin Center for the Arts]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="Gibans1982"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibans |first=Nina Freedlander |title=The Community Arts Council Movement: History, Opinions, Issues |date=1982 |publisher=Praeger |pages=141–142 |isbn=0-03-062052-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the commission became part of the new Office of Cultural Affairs, along with the Office of Film, Video and New Media.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In 2002 this new office was cut back significantly by the mayor as part of reducing the city debt.&lt;ref name=Combs2005&gt;{{cite news |last=Combs |first=Marianne |title=Minneapolis unveils new plan for the arts |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/22_combsm_mplsartsplan/?refid=0 |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s the Arts Commission developed the new Minneapolis 10-year plan for the arts. The ''Minneapolis Plan for Arts and Culture'' was made public in September 2005.&lt;ref name=Combs2005 /&gt;

'''National Ukrainian Academy of Arts''' ({{lang-ua|Академія мистецтв України (АМУ)}}) is a state scientific and artistic institution in the field of art, culture, and art history in [[Ukraine]]. The academy is one of the six state funded institutions along with the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] that was established in 1996 and obtained its National status in 2010. The membership to the academy is on an electoral basis for the distinguished specialists of professional artistry: theater and film directors, composers, painters, conductors, actors etc.

==History==
===Origin=== 
The work of [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy#Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv-Mohyla]] and [[Ostroh Academy|Ostroh Academies]] had a strong influence on the development of Ukrainian Arts in the 16th and 17th centuries. Theatrical performances, dramas, and music concerts performed by students with other important events have taken place in the aforementioned academies on the eve of holidays and festivals. In general, the foundation of academies in Ukraine is historically connected with the growth of the cultural level of Ukrainian society and with essential changes in the development of the education of artists. Increasing the possibilities for development of talented youth’s creativity and carrying out complex, scientific research lies at the base of academics.

===First academy (1918)===
On the 18th of December 1917, the Ukrainian State Academy of Arts (nowadays [[The National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture]]), was founded. The founding of the Academy, one of the highest level art education centers in Europe, and its further development in the history of Ukrainian culture was a remarkable event in the life of Ukrainian Art and is regarded as continuing glamorous Ukrainian traditions in Art and the realization of nation’s cultural needs and desires. In 1922 the Academy was reorganized and renamed the Institution of Plastic Arts. In 1924 it was renamed Kyiv Fine Arts Institute.

===After liquidation===
The creative potential of the outstanding masters of Ukrainian culture required further development. So the idea of founding an Academy of a scientific-creative type appeared in the 1920s. From 1927 to 1928, on behalf of the government, the presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Science formed a special committee headed by AS academician of Ukraine O. P. Novytskyy. The committee prepared special documents so that the Ukrainian Academy of Arts could be established. Afterwards, due to repressions of artistic intelligentsia, of which a number of art critics, for example F. L. Ernst, M. F. Bilyashyvskyy, D. M. Scherbakivskyy, M. O. Makarenko and others were subjected, the foundation of the Academy was postponed. In 1941 at the request of artistic intelligentsia the Ukrainian authorities resumed planning for the Academy’s foundation, but this time the [[Second World War]] was the obstacle.

Right after the war a range of scientific research institutions for building-architectural and artistic profile were opened in Ukraine within the Academy of Architecture (in 1956 it was reorganized into the URSS Academy of Architecture and Building and it was liquidated in 1964). The Institution on the Theory and History of Architecture, the Institution of Monumental Painting and Sculpture, and the Institution of Artistic Industry were among them. Scientific Research departments on the theory and history of Art, post graduate education, workshops for art critics, artists and architects were contained in the structure of these establishments. The masters of Art and Architecture P. O. Biletskyy, H. N. Lohvyn, V. H. Zabolotnyy, P. M. Zholtovskyy, O. S. Shovkunenko carried out theoretical and practical work there.

Numerous fundamental works on the History of Art and Architecture were published during those days, including “The History of the Ukrainian Art” in six volumes. In 1960 many of the scientific research institutions within the Academy of Architecture and Building were liquidated while others were distributed into different departments. Haphazard reorganization and eradication of the Ukrainian Art School in the years of repression destroyed a rich inheritance of traditions and ideas. From 1970s to 1980s, the art community brought up the question a number of times of founding the Academy and its corresponding institutions. At last the idea of organizing the State Scientific Research Institution was approved by the Ukrainian government and was fulfilled on December 14, 1996.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{:List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{expand section|with=Main storyline(s) of seasons 1-4|date=August 2018}}

The series begins revolving around [[Piper Chapman]] ([[Taylor Schilling]]), a woman in her thirties living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a [[Prison#Security|minimum-security]] women's [[federal prison]] in [[upstate New York]]. Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years prior to the start of the series and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fiancé, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest) and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the "Federal Department of Corrections" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management &amp; Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.

The fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues, during which some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement in the riot. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically shot by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally shot by a corrupt "strike team", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken hostage of the guard. All inmates are transported to other prisons.

The consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned. Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.

Throughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination, among other issues, affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being, the correctional officers, and the prison's basic ability to fulfill its fundamental responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=cite secondary source(s) for analyses}} One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities, Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down.

Show creator [[Jenji Kohan]] read [[Piper Kerman]]'s memoir after a friend sent it to her. She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she "screwed up" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation.&lt;ref name="Collidermay"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radish |first1=Christina |title=Creator Jenji Kohan Talks ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK, Her Research Into Prison Life, and Graphic Sex Scenes |url=http://collider.com/jenji-kohan-orange-is-the-new-black-interview/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, [[Piper Chapman]], as a "trojan horse" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Orange' Creator Jenji Kohan: 'Piper Was My Trojan Horse' |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/13/211639989/orange-creator-jenji-kohan-piper-was-my-trojan-horse |publisher=NPR |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, it was revealed that Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate for a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs with Kohan as creator.&lt;ref name="based"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/07/netflix-eyeing-second-original-series-comedy-from-weeds-creator-jenji-kohan/ |title=Netflix Eyeing Second Original Series – Comedy From ''Weeds'' Creator Jenji Kohan |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, negotiations were finalized and the series had been [[Green-light|greenlit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/netflix-lionsgate-tv-closing-deal-for-jenji-kohans-orange-is-the-new-black-comedy/ |title=Netflix, Lionsgate TV Closing Deal For Jenji Kohan's 'Orange Is The New Black' Comedy |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohan had initially wanted to cast [[Katie Holmes]] in the role of Piper Chapman, and met with the actress to discuss it, but Holmes had other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/06/katie-holmes-almost-starred-in-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=Katie Holmes almost starred in 'Orange is the New Black'|website=[[New York Post]]|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casting announcements began in August 2012 with [[Taylor Schilling]], the first to be cast, as Piper Chapman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/taylor-schilling-to-star-in-jenji-kohans-netflix-series-orange-is-the-new-black/ |title=Taylor Schilling To Star in Jenji Kohan's Netflix Series ''Orange Is The New Black'' |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=August 30, 2012 |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Jason Biggs]] as Piper's fiancé Larry Bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jason-biggs-netflix-orange-new-black-jenji-kohan-weeds-369610 |title=Jason Biggs to Co-Star in Netflix's 'Orange Is the New Black' (Exclusive) |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=September 12, 2012 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, it was reported that a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] had stolen the first ten episodes of the fifth season in a security breach of a post-production company. Netflix failed to respond to ransom demands, and the cybercriminal [[internet leak|leaked]] the episodes online.

'''''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather''''' is an 1896 painting by [[Camille Pissarro]] in the collection of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.net/agoid6668 Camille Pissarro, ''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen'', Art Gallery of Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a series of painting Pissarro did of [[Pont Boïeldieu]] and the industrial quays surrounding it. Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On his 1896 trip he stayed at the [[Hôtel de Paris]] in Rouen, from January to April 1896, and it is in this period that this painting was made. His room overlooked the [[Seine]], and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Eitner. ''19th century European painting: David to Cézanne.'' Westview Press, 2002 pg. 427&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orléans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, ''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather'' is a return to [[Impressionism]] after a decade of experimenting with [[Post-Impressionism]] and [[Pointalism]].  Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]].

In a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: "The theme is the bridge near the Placede la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Bernier. ''Monument, moment, and memory: Monet's cathedral in fin de siècle France'' Bucknell University Press, 2007. pg. 36 &lt;/ref&gt; He further wrote, "what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Gallery of Ontario: Selected Works.'' Art Gallery of Ontario, 1990 pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by [[Reuben Wells Leonard]] upon his death in 1937. It is one of six Pissarros on public display in Canada, with two others at the AGO, and the others being at the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Art Gallery of Hamilton]] and the [[Art Gallery of Greater Victoria]].

The '''Pug Awards''' are a [[Toronto]] architecture award that rates buildings based on popular votes. Each spring the Pug Awards website lists all buildings completed the previous year in [[Toronto]] that have more than 50,000 feet of floor space. As of 2009, buildings outside the Old City of Toronto (including North York and Etobicoke) are eligible for awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Roberts | first=Rob | author-link=Rob Roberts | title=Architecture of the inner suburbs to get Pug Awards scrutiny this year | newspaper=[[The National Post]] | location=Toronto | date=30 April 2009 | url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2009/04/30/architecture-of-the-inner-suburbs-to-get-pug-awards-scrutiny-this-year.aspx | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were created in 2004 by Gary Berman and Anna Simone . They were originally named the "Fugly Awards" and highlighted the ugliest buildings completed, but the name was then softened to the Puglies, and finally to the Pugs, with a [[Pug]] dog as the mascot. In 2008 the awards introduced the "Pug Cup," which will be carved each year with the winning building and displayed at [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]].

'''René Goscinny''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəne ɡosini|lang}}, {{IPA-pl|ɡɔɕˈtɕinnɨ|lang|Pl-gościnny.ogg}}; 14 August 1926 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1977) was a French comics editor and [[Comics writer|writer]] of [[Poles|Polish]] descent, who is best known internationally for the [[comic book]] ''[[Astérix]]'', which he created with illustrator [[Albert Uderzo]], and for his work on the comic series ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' with [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] (considered the series' golden age) and ''[[Iznogoud]]'' with [[Jean Tabary]]. He also authored a series of children's books known as "''[[Le Petit Nicolas]]''" series (Little Nicolas).

==Early life==
Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926, to a family of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="obs"&gt;{{cite web | last = Garcia|first= Laure|work =Le Nouvel Observateur | title = Uderzo, le dernier Gaulois | url = http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p2136/articles/a280131-uderzo__le_dernier_gaulois.html|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Stanisław Simkha Gościnny (the surname means ''hospitable'' in Polish; Simkha is his Jewish name meaning ''happiness''), a chemical engineer from [[Warsaw]], Poland, and Anna (Hanna) Bereśniak-Gościnna from Chodorków, a small village near [[Żytomierz]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (now part of [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;According to Yeruham Eniss the village had a soap factory that supplied the large Jewish community of nearby Chortkow with jobs selling and trading in soap. A census made in the late 1930s counted 3670 Jewish families in Khodorkov before WWII ([[ShtetLinks]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; Claude, René's older brother was born six years earlier, on 10 December 1920. Stanisław and Anna had met in Paris and married in 1919. The Gościnnys moved to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], two years after René's birth, because of a chemical engineer post Stanisław had obtained there. He spent a happy childhood in Buenos Aires, and studied in the French schools there. He had a habit of being the "class clown", probably to compensate for a natural shyness. He started drawing very early on, inspired by the illustrated stories which he enjoyed reading.

In December 1943, the year after he graduated from school, 17-year-old Goscinny lost his father to a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], forcing him to find a job. The next year, he got his first job, as an assistant accountant in a tire recovery factory, and when he was laid off the following year, he became a junior illustrator in an advertising agency.&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = René Goscinny | url =http://lambiek.net/artists/g/goscinny.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goscinny, along with his mother, left Argentina and went to New York in 1945, to join her brother Boris. To avoid service in the US military, he travelled to France to join the [[French Army]] in 1946. He served at [[Aubagne]], in the 141st Alpine Infantry Battalion. Promoted to senior [[corporal]], he became the appointed artist of the regiment and drew illustrations and posters for the army.

==First works==
The following year, he illustrated the book ''The Girl with The Eyes of Gold'' and returned to New York. On his arrival Goscinny went through the most difficult period of his life. For a while, he was jobless, alone and totally broke. By 1948, though, he recovered and started working in a small studio where he became friends with future ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' contributors [[Will Elder]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Harvey Kurtzman]].&lt;ref name="lambiek"/&gt; Goscinny then became art director at [[Kunen Publishers]] where he wrote four books for children. Around this time he met two Belgian comic artists, Joseph Gillain, better known as [[Jijé]], and Maurice de Bevere, aka [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], the [[cartoonist]] and author of the series ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' (which Goscinny would write from 1955 to his death in 1977).&lt;ref name="lambiek"/&gt;

[[Georges Troisfontaines]], chief of the [[World Press agency]], convinced Goscinny to return to Paris and work for his agency as the head of the Paris office in 1951. There he met [[Albert Uderzo]], with whom he started a longtime collaboration.&lt;ref name="lambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lagardere"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lagardère | title = Release of the 33rd Asterix volume | url =http://www.lagardere.com/us/actualites/detail_actu.cfm?idt=9&amp;idn=5994&amp;nav=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They started out with some work for ''[[Bonnes Soirées]]'', a women's magazine for which Goscinny wrote ''Sylvie''. Goscinny and Uderzo also launched the series ''Jehan Pistolet'' and ''Luc Junior'' in ''[[La Libre Junior]]''.

In 1955, Goscinny, together with Uderzo, [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], and [[Jean Hébrad]], founded the syndicate Edipress/Edifrance. The syndicate launched publications like ''Clairon'' for the factory union and ''Pistolin'' for a chocolate company. Goscinny and Uderzo cooperated on the series ''Bill Blanchart'' in ''Jeannot'', ''Pistolet'' in ''Pistolin'' and ''Benjamin et Benjamine'' in the magazine of the same name. Under the pseudonym Agostini, Goscinny wrote ''[[Le petit Nicolas|Le Petit Nicolas]]'' for [[Jean-Jacques Sempé]] in ''[[Le Moustique]]'' and later ''[[Sud-Ouest (magazine)|Sud-Ouest]]'' and ''[[Pilote]]'' magazines.

In 1956, Goscinny began a collaboration with ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine. He wrote some short stories for [[Jo Angenot]] and [[Albert Weinberg]], and worked on ''Signor Spaghetti'' with [[Dino Attanasio]], ''Monsieur Tric'' with [[Bob de Moor]], ''[[Prudence Petitpas]]'' with [[Maurice Maréchal (comics artist)|Maurice Maréchal]], ''Globul le Martien'' and ''Alphonse'' with [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]], ''Strapontin'' with [[Arthur Berckmans|Berck]] and ''[[Modeste et Pompon]]'' with [[André Franquin]]. An early creation with Uderzo, ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', was also adapted for serial publication in ''Tintin'' from 1958-1962.&lt;ref name="asterix int"&gt;{{cite web | last = Asterix International! | title = Albert Uderzo | url =http://www.asterix-international.de/asterix/uderzo.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Goscinny appeared in the magazines ''[[Paris-Flirt]]'' (''Lili Manequin'' with [[Will (comics)|Will]]) and ''[[Vaillant (magazine)|Vaillant]]'' (''Boniface et Anatole'' with Jordom, ''Pipsi'' with Godard).

==''Pilote'' and ''Astérix''==
In 1959, the Édifrance/Édipresse syndicate started the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]''.&lt;ref name="BDO-1959"&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1959|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1959.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goscinny became one of the most productive writers for the magazine. In the magazine's first issue, he launched his most famous creation, ''[[Asterix|Astérix]]'', with Uderzo. The series was an instant hit and remains popular worldwide. Goscinny also restarted the series ''Le Petit Nicolas'' and ''Jehan Pistolet'', now called ''Jehan Soupolet''. Goscinny also began ''Jacquot le Mousse'' and ''Tromblon et Bottaclou'' with Godard.

The magazine was bought by [[Georges Dargaud]] in 1960, and Goscinny became editor-in-chief. He also began new series like ''Les Divagations de Monsieur Sait-Tout'' (with Martial), ''La Potachologie Illustrée'' (with [[Cabu]]), ''Les Dingodossiers'' (with [[Marcel Gotlieb|Gotlib]]) and ''La Forêt de Chênebeau'' (with [[Mic Delinx]]). With [[Tabary]], he launched ''Calife Haroun El Poussah'' in ''Record'', a series that was later continued in ''Pilote'' as ''[[Iznogoud]]''. With [[Raymond Macherot]] he created ''Pantoufle'' for ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]''.

==Family==
Goscinny married Gilberte Pollaro-Millo in 1967. In 1968 their daughter [[Anne Goscinny]], who also became an author, was born.

==Death==
[[File:GoscinnyRenéGrabstein.JPG|thumb|René Goscinny's tombstone in Nice (F)]]

Goscinny died at 51, in Paris of [[cardiac arrest]] on 5 November 1977, during a routine [[cardiac stress test|stress test]] at his doctor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/20121108.OBS8681/le-gag-rate-de-goscinny-mourir-d-un-arret-du-c-ur-chez-son-cardiologue.html|title=Le gag raté de Goscinny : mourir d’un arrêt du cœur chez son cardiologue|work=Sciences et Avenir|language=French|access-date=2015-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115059/http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/20121108.OBS8681/le-gag-rate-de-goscinny-mourir-d-un-arret-du-c-ur-chez-son-cardiologue.html|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Nice. In accordance with his will, most of his money was transferred to the chief rabbinate of France.

After Goscinny's death, Uderzo began to write ''Asterix'' himself and continued the series, although at a much slower pace, until passing the series over in 2011 to [[Jean-Yves Ferri]] (script) and [[Didier Conrad]] (art).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/italy-beckons-for-gaul-comic-heros-asterix-and-obelix/&lt;/ref&gt; Tabary similarly began to write ''Iznogoud'' himself, whereas Morris continued ''Lucky Luke'' with various other writers.

In a tribute to Goscinny, Uderzo gave his likeness to one of the characters in ''L'Odyssée d'Astérix'' ("[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]").

The '''Royal Palace of Ugarit''' was the royal residence of the rulers of the ancient kingdom of [[Ugarit]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of [[Syria]]. The palace was excavated with the rest of the city from the 1930s by [[French people|French]] archaeologist [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]] and is considered one of the most important finds made at Ugarit.

==Overview==

===Layout===
The palace, located in the north-west corner of the city, spanned an area of {{convert|6500|m2}}. The palace area was surrounded by a fortified wall that dates back to the 15th-century BC. The palace's main gate was protected by an array of towers, dubbed the Fortress, with {{convert|5|m}} thick walls.&lt;ref name=Gates60&gt;Gates, 2003, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace consisted of ninety rooms divided between two floors. The rooms were built around four large courtyards and four smaller ones. The western end of the palace had a large garden. In the north side of the palace, three underground [[Chamber tomb|burial chambers]] were constructed. The ground floor was used for administrative purposes and included offices, archives, storage and staff dwellings. The second floor housed the family quarters, and was accessed through twelve staircases.&lt;ref name=Gates60/&gt; The palace had three entrances: the main gate on the northwest near the Fortress, and two smaller entrances in the northeast and the southwest.&lt;ref name=Gates61/&gt;

===Architecture===
The palace was built in four major stages between the 15th and 13th-century BC.&lt;ref name=Gates60/&gt; It was built out of [[ashlar]] stone blocks and wooden [[Joist|crossbeams]], with a thick coat of plain [[plaster]] covering the walls.&lt;ref name=Gates61&gt;Gates, 2003, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortified wall, which dates back to the 15th-century BC, was built with packed stones at the bottom and had an outward slope of 45 degrees.&lt;ref name=Gates60/&gt;

The layout is typical of palaces of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and the [[Ancient Near East]]. The irregular outline of the palace and the asymmetrical layout are evidence of constant additions and alterations. The burial chambers had [[Corbel arch|corbelled vaults]] which show a connection with [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Mycenaean Greece#Architecture|Mycenaean architecture]].&lt;ref name=Gates60/&gt;

==Excavation==
{{Ugarit}}
After the chance discovery of [[Ugarit]] by local peasants in 1929, French archaeologist, [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]] led ten excavation campaigns at the site which only covered the northwest corner. Excavations stopped with the advent of [[World War II]] and only resumed in 1948. Between 1950–1955 Schaeffer led concentrated excavations at the palace which unearthed a vast corpus of tablets and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Younger, 2007, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifacts===
Objects found at the site included [[ivory carving]]s, furniture, [[Stele|stone stelae]], and [[figurine]]s.&lt;ref name=Gates61/&gt; An [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]-made [[alabaster]] vase was found partially damaged. The ornamentation on the vase depicts the wedding of Ugarit King [[Niqmaddu II]] to an upper-class Egyptian woman.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ed., 1981, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Other vases of Egyptian origin found at the site include ones carrying the [[cartouche]]s of Egyptian Kings [[Ramesses II]] and [[Horemheb]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2006, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablets===
Eight archives of [[cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] were excavated in the palace complex. The corpus included more than a 1,000 tablets written mostly in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]]. A small corpus of [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] tablets were discovered as well.&lt;ref&gt;Schniedewind; Hunt, 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets were organized by subject in different wings. They included administrative reports about Ugarit's dependencies, judicial records, official correspondence with other rulers and even practice tablets that new [[scribe]]s used to learn writing.&lt;ref name=Gates62&gt;Gates, 2003, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets included about 36 [[hymn]]s, known as the [[Hurrian songs]].&lt;ref&gt;Stolba, 1995, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian Telegraph Agency''' ({{lang-ru|Российское телеграфное агентство}}, ''Rossiyskoye telegrafnoye agentstvo''), [[abbreviation|abbr.]] '''ROSTA''', was the [[State media|state]] [[news agency]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] (1918-35). After the creation of [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, it remained the news agency of Soviet Russia. Its name was associated with ''Rosta windows'' ({{lang-ru|Окна Роста}}, ''Okna Rosta'').

==Rosta windows==
Rosta windows or satirical Rosta windows ({{lang-ru|Окна сатиры Роста}}, ''Okna satiry Rosta'') were [[stencil]]-replicated [[propaganda]] [[poster]]s created by artists and poets within the Rosta system, under the supervision of the Chief Committee of Political Education during 1919-21. Inheriting the [[Russia]]n design traditions of [[lubok]] and [[rayok]], the main topics were current political events. They were usually displayed in windows, hence the name.

The first Rosta window was created in Moscow by Mikhail Cheremnykh (1890-1962). He was soon joined by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], a popular and prolific author, [[Dmitry Moor]] (1883-1946), [[Amshey Nurenberg]] (1887-1979), [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Mikhail Volpin]] and others. Similar projects were performed in other Soviet cities. Cheremnykh and Mayakovsky, for example, produced a poster in 1921 satirising a [[French people|French]] delegation led by [[Joseph Noulens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O74913/poster/ V&amp;A Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design featured graphical simplicity suitable for viewing from distance and often used [[lubok]]-styled sequences of pictures according to some plot, similar to modern [[comics]]. The posters were not printed but rather painted with cut-out stencils made from cardboard. Once the required number of posters was painted, the stencils were sent to another city and put in circulation throughout the Soviet Union.

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], this approach was reproduced in Tass windows by [[Kukryniksy]].

A '''simulacrum''' ([[plural]]: '''simulacra''' from {{lang-la|simulacrum}}, which means "likeness, similarity") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Word of the Day |date=1 May 2003 |publisher=dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217130815/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |archivedate=17 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.&lt;ref&gt;"simulacrum" ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] offers [[photorealism]] as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is sometimes created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"&gt;Massumi, Brian.

==Philosophy==
Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', [[Plato]] speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek statuary]], which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a [[metaphor]] for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plato |title=The Sophist |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |chapter=Reason in Philosophy |title=Twilight of the Idols |others=Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale |year=1888 |url=http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426104633/http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodernism/Philosophy|Postmodernist]] French [[social theorist]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Simulacra and Simulations"&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html Baudrillard Simulacra] retrieved 2 May 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=9 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, [[Gilles Deleuze]], takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or "privileged position" could be "challenged and overturned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deleuze |first=Gilles |title=Difference and Repetition |others=Translated by Paul Patton |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Columbia |year=1968 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze defines simulacra as "those systems in which different relates to different ''by means of'' difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no ''prior [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'', no ''internal resemblance''".&lt;ref&gt;p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]], in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Ethics - An Essay on the Understanding of Evil|others=Translated by Peter Hallward |publisher=Verso |location=London |year=2001 |pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')".

==Recreation==
Recreational simulacra include [[historical reenactment|reenactments of historical events]] or replicas of landmarks, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as [[Fantasyland]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that [[Walt Disney World Resort]] is a copy of a copy, "a simulacrum to the second power".&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ "Disneyworld Company."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152759/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ |date=27 May 2010 }} retrieved 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] argued that at Disney's parks, "we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''Travels in Hyperreality.'' Reproduced in relevant portion at
[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html "The City of Robots"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912200642/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html |date=12 September 2006 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of [[national park]]s, [[Disney's Wilderness Lodge]], environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and [[anthropologist]] Eric Higgs expressed worry that "the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value".&lt;ref&gt;Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html "Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704185846/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html |date=4 July 2007 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist [[Paul McCarthy]] has created entire installations based on ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.

==Caricature==
An interesting example of simulacrum is [[caricature]]. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.

==Iconography==
Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;11) employs the term "simulacrum" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether [[iconic]] or [[aniconic]], in the landscape or greater field of [[Thangka]] art and Tantric Buddhist [[iconography]]. For example, an iconographic [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a [[sacred mountain]] in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an "auspicious canopy" (Sanskrit: [[Chhatra]]) of the [[Ashtamangala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Robert |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-416-2 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] approach a [[cultural universal]] and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the [[human psychology]].

==Word usage==
The Latinised plural ''simulacra'' is interchangeable with the anglicised version ''simulacrums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |title=simulacrum |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712155454/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed in 1984 on a commission from the BBC Philharmonic, who gave the world premiere on 19 February 1985, at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, with [[Edward Downes]] conducting.

==Character and materials==
The form of the symphony, along with those of its predecessors, owes a great debt to the symphonies of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] {{harv|Warnaby|2001}}. A second influence came from Renaissance architecture, particularly the churches of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. Davies explains that his use of [[Fibonacci numbers]] to proportion the symphony was modelled directly on Brunelleschi's structures {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=2}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (second doubling alto flute, third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. Unlike the preceding two symphonies, the only percussion instruments employed in the Third are the timpani. Here they often assume a soloistic role (even more than in the [[Symphony No. 2 (Davies)|Second Symphony]]) in order to emphasize the focal [[pitch class]]es {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=43}}.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in four movements:
# Lento – Adagio – Andante – Moderato – Allegretto – Allegro moderato – Allegro – Allegro alla breve
# Scherzo I: Allegro
# Scherzo II: Allegro vivace: scorrevole e bisbigliando
# Lento – Adagio flessibile
Each of these movements is based on the same architectural outline, but expresses it with a different constructional technique. In addition, this same outline informs the construction of the symphony as a whole, and is also used as the basis of subdividing sections of each movement {{harv|Davies|1985}}. 

The symphony begins with a movement approximating the traditional [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]] {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=425}}. It begins in slow tempo in the tonality of D, quoting in the flutes a [[plainsong]] addressed to the [[Archangel Michael]], "Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in praelio", and the movement becomes progressively faster until the opening material and tonality returns and "the music is blown right away, as if it were on scurrying air-currents" {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=2}}. The pitches of the chant are first "sieved" by to retain only the first occurrence of pitch classes. This results in a seven-note sequence, which is expanded to an eight-note set by the arbitrary addition of D. This set is then arranged in an 8 x 8 transposition square (where the row is transposed successively to begin on each of its eight pitches), and this square is manipulated according to the 64-element [[Magic square#Europe|Magic Square of Mercury]] {{harv|Jones|1998|loc=18–20}}. At the same time, durations are built according to Fibonacci numbers descending from 21 downwards, with each number representing a multiple of a [[breve]] unit {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=415}}. Within this process of acceleration the pitch material converges onto a centre of F which, together with B and A-flat, forms an alternative tonal centre to the tonic D throughout the symphony {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=413}}.

The second and third movements are a pair of scherzos. The composer likens the second movement to the visual experience of contemplating a Brunelleschi church nave from a fixed central point. In addition, there was a “physical inspiration”, of nesting seabirds wheeling around a towering cliff face {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}. 

The second of the pair of scherzos distorts the perspective of the first, as if the same nave were being seen from one side. In this movement, the composer consciously borrows a device from the "Burlesque" movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Ninth Symphony]], "where the tumult stops and the composer lets in 'windows'", through which slow passages of the adagio finale are glimpsed {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}. 

The form of the third movement affects the finale in three ways. First, the "windows" disrupt the musical continuity of the previous two movements, and thereby "reducing, but not totally avoiding, the likelihood of an archetypal formal design being used in the finale" {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=425}}. Second, the windows' tonality of C{{Music|sharp}}, the modal dominants G{{Music|sharp}} and F, and the diatonic dominant A (all established by the timpani), anticipate the finale. Thirdly, the windows sections, characterised by texture rather than by motif, recur twice in the finale ({{harvnb|Jones|2000|loc=426}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2002|loc=40}}).  

The finale then returns to the material of the first movement, and develops it more amply {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}.

On the largest scale, the four movements of the symphony combine into a single, overarching “meta-sonata form” {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=431–32}}. All four movements, however, resist structural closure by denying the tonic's usual function of asserting its superiority at the end, and an important aspect of the formal unfolding of the entire work is the oscillation between sections having tonal focus on the one hand with others of a tonally ambiguous polyphony {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=40–41}}.

[[File:Charles Robert Leslie - Sir Walter Scott - Ravenswood and Lucy at the Mermaiden's Well - Bride of Lammermoor.jpg|thumb|200px|A scene from ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'']]
'''Tales of my Landlord''' is a series of novels by Sir [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) that form a subset of the so-called [[Waverley Novels]]. There are four series:

{| class="wikitable"
! Title !! Published !! Main setting !! Period
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of My Landlord'', 1st series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Black Dwarf (novel)|The Black Dwarf]]'' || 1816 || [[Scottish Borders]] || 1707
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Tale of Old Mortality]]'' || 1816 || Southern Scotland || 1679–89
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 2nd series:

|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' || 1818 || [[Edinburgh]], [[Richmond, London]], || 1736
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 3rd series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' || 1819 || [[East Lothian]] || 1709–11
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[A Legend of Montrose]]'' || 1819 || [[Scottish Highlands]] || 1644–5
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 4th series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' || 1832 || [[Constantinople]], [[Shkodër|Scutari]] || 1097
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Castle Dangerous]]'' || 1832 || [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] || 1307
|}

Of these, ''The Heart of Midlothian'' and ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' have been the most successful, and ''Old Mortality'' is considered by modern critics to be among Scott's best work. The fourth were the least successful.

They were so called because they were supposed to be tales collected from the (fictional) landlord of the Wallace Inn at Gandercleugh, compiled by a "Peter Pattieson", and edited and sent to the publisher by [[Jedediah Cleishbotham]]. This is gone into in great depth in the introduction to ''The Black Dwarf''.

The first series was planned to comprise four volumes, each containing a separate novel, but Scott — by his own admission — botched ''The Black Dwarf'', and ''Old Mortality'' came to be three volumes in its own right. [http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/dwarf.html]. The other three series thus consisted of two volumes each, or just one, in the case of the second.

They were supposed to reflect aspects of Scottish regional life.

'''''The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam''''' (1998) is a book by Vietnam veteran and Sociology professor Jerry Lembcke. The book is an analysis of the widely believed, but historically inaccurate, [[urban legend]] that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by [[Anti-war movement|antiwar protesters]] upon returning home from the [[Vietnam War]]. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the "spat-upon image" through Hollywood movies and fiction literature, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and antiwar movement has come to be represented.

Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by antiwar activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and antiwar forces.  The book documents the efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military servicemen and the antiwar movement by portraying democratic dissent as betrayal of the troops, effectively redirecting blame for failure in Vietnam onto protesters.  Coupled with American society's exaggeration of medical conditions like [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and drug abuse among veterans to the point of broadly vilifying the Vietnam veteran as mentally unfit, emotionally volatile and a "loser" and "victim", the collective memory about Vietnam has been refocused onto the veteran and away from the war. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the antiwar movement and veterans with the similar [[Stab-in-the-back myth|'stab in the back' myths]] propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/06/0081080 Stabbed in the back! The Past and Future of a Right-wing Myth] Kevin Baker; ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''; June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke details the resurrection of this myth of the spat-upon veteran by later administrations during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way of silencing public dissent.

==Origins==
A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|those who protested]] the United States's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] is that protesters spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them "baby-killers", etc. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the war in Vietnam ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the antiwar movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period's antiwar movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular collective memory. Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist [[Bob Greene]] noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning.  It was the leaders of government, and the top generals—at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, "Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home." You heard that at every peace rally in America. "Bring the boys home." That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable.  So-called "hippies," no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport.  Now think of a "hippie" crossing his path.  Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier?  And if the hippie did, would the soldier—fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam—just stand there and take it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]] listed the spitting myth as one of the "Top Six Myths" from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth "derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GI's were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Texts/Scholarly/Baky_White_Cong_01.html The Ambient Truth of Vietnam War Legendry]; John Baky, March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, "to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie", and noted that myths like that of antiwar activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or "erased history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=--FmCtmAO2QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Generation+at+the+Crossroads:+Apathy+and+Action+on+the+American+Campus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=odh0VNMT2OegBLDLgpgP&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spitting&amp;f=false Generation at the Crossroads: Apathy and Action on the American Campus]; Paul Rogat Loeb; Rutgers University Press; 1995; pgs. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as "anti-troop".&lt;ref&gt;Beamish, Thomas D., Harvey Molotch, and Richard Flacks. 1995. "Who Supports the Troops? Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the Making of Collective Memory." Social Problems Journal 42 (3):344-60&lt;/ref&gt; As observed by [[Clarence Page]] after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, "the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn't happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did."&lt;ref name="JWR"&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/page090298.html Whose history?]; [[Jewish World Review]]; September 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the antiwar movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==

At the time he wrote ''The Spitting Image'', Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported "spitting on soldiers" scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt "spat upon" by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the "baby-killer" and "murderer" components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]], like "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"

''The Spitting Image'' asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by antiwar demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend's growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', in which a "spat-upon veteran" image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President [[George H. W. Bush]] as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the [[Gulf War]] to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the [[yellow ribbon#United States|yellow ribbon]] ''Support our Troops'' campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of antiwar sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common antiwar chant being "Support the Troops: Bring them Home!"

The "spat-upon veteran" meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene's book ''[[Homecoming: When the Soldiers Returned from Vietnam|Homecoming]]'' reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon.&lt;ref name="JWR"/&gt; Greene's book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn't validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, "There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact." Greene concluded, "I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told."&lt;ref&gt;''Homecoming; When the Soldier Returned from Vietnam''; Bob Greene; G. P. Putnam's Sons; 1989; Pgs. 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; "Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief", says Lembcke, who cited Greene's book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lembke said, "These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn't surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on antiwar demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans.&lt;ref name="RLG"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051014023306/http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=95 1999 Annual Membership Meeting]; Research Libraries Group; 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a "friendly" welcome.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pgs. 68, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] vowed in its founding principle: Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another.&lt;ref name="Mazur"&gt;''A More Perfect Military: How the Constitution Can Make Our Military Stronger''; Diane H. Mazur; Oxford University Press, 2010; Pgs. 98-101&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Spitting Image'' Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative—that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on—saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "I cannot, of course, prove to anyone's satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

==Reception and influence==
{{quote|The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. [...] It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military. For that reason alone the conventional wisdom is important, because it explains much about our civil-military dynamic today. It is also important, however, to understand why that accepted memory is untrue, and who benefits most from keeping it alive. The myth of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran is a difficult one to challenge. [...] One intrepid soul, Professor Jerry Lembcke, both a Vietnam veteran and an academic researcher from Holy Cross University, stepped into the fray [...] Every time he discusses his findings in a public forum, a hail of angry responses follows, but his explanations and conclusions are compelling and unsettling.| Diane H.

Shafer's ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' online articles on the matter, which frequently cited Lembcke's research, generated enormous feedback; the May 2000 article alone received nearly 300 postings on the subject in just a few days, one of its largest-ever responses.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"&gt;''[[Humanity and Society]]''; Volume 26, Number 1; February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shafer, the myth persists primarily because: 

{{quote box|width=50%|align=left|1) Those who didn't go to Vietnam—that being most of us—don't dare contradict the "experience" of those who did;

2) The story helps maintain the perfect sense of shame many of us feel about the way we ignored our Vietvets;

3) The press keeps the story in play by uncritically repeating it, as the Times and U.S. News did;

4) Because any fool with 33 cents and the gumption to repeat the myth in his letter to the editor can keep it in circulation. Most recent mentions of the spitting protester in Nexis are of this variety.}}

Shafer acknowledges that it's possible that a Vietnam veteran somewhere might have been spat upon during the war years, and notes that Lembcke concedes as much because nobody can prove something never happened.  Shafer announced a challenge to his readers, "Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. Or the e-mail writer claims it happened to a brother or a friend at the airport or bus station. I expect similar e-mails this time, and I will share with readers any account that comes with some sort of evidence—such as a contemporaneous newspaper story or an arrest report—that documents the sordid event.  If you can point me to a documented case of a returning Viet vet getting spat upon, please drop a line to slate.pressbox@gmail.com. E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise."

Likewise, Lembcke joined the discussion and also commented on it in the ''[[Humanity &amp; Society]]'' journal, saying the stories just keep getting better, and asking for any evidence to be raised. The discussions spawned yet another round of more than 60 stories, yet only one was credible.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"/&gt;

Northwestern Law School professor [[James Lindgren]] also joined the discussions and, after a review of contemporary news sources, initially claimed to have found news accounts that discussed spitting incidents.  Lembcke provided an 18-point response to Lindgren's research, refuting each of his claims but expressing interest in one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/02/more_spit_takes.html]; Slate Magazine; 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A December 27, 1971 CBS Evening News report on veteran Delmar Pickett who said he was spat at in Seattle appeared, according to Lembcke, to have some validity as a claim, but still not as evidence that the incident reported actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBS Evening News]], ([[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] reporting) [http://www.slate.com/id/2161038/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=214568 Vietnam Veteran CBS News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some second-hand news accounts that mention spitting do actually exist, although there has been no evidence to support the narrative that antiwar demonstrators were responsible. Documented accounts exist where the antiwar demonstrators were actually the victims, not the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;  Other commentators have since addressed the myth to various degrees, even referencing the debate spawned by the Slate files.

In his 2009 book, ''War Stories'', historian and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to the myth of "Spit-upon veterans".  He closely examined Greene's book of letters and the Slate files, as well as the research by Lindgren and Lembcke.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"&gt;''War Stories: False Atrocity Tales, Swift Boaters, and Winter Soldiers - What Really Happened in Vietnam; Gary Kulik; [[Potomac Books]], Inc., 2009; Pgs. 79-96&lt;/ref&gt;  Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene's book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the "surprising number" of veterans who "refuse to believe" the spitting stories, and wrote, "Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible."  Kulik also criticized Lindgren's research, writing, "Lindgren's evidence includes only one single first-person ("I was spit upon") account—the stories that are at the heart of Lembcke's book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed."  Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the antiwar movement. "The image of 'hippie' men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false."&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;
   
Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: "There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. [...] The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. [...] It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military. For that reason alone the conventional wisdom is important, because it explains much about our civil-military dynamic today. It is also important, however, to understand why that accepted memory is untrue, and who benefits most from keeping it alive. The myth of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran is a difficult one to challenge. [...] One intrepid soul, Professor Jerry Lembcke, both a Vietnam veteran and an academic researcher from Holy Cross University, stepped into the fray ... Every time he discusses his findings in a public forum, a hail of angry responses follows, but his explanations and conclusions are compelling and unsettling.&lt;ref name="Mazur"/&gt;

===Reviews===
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an [[angry mob]] of antiwar protesters yelling, 'Murderer!' and 'Baby killer!' Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran's face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of [[urban legend|urban myth]] that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"&gt;[http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=5151 The Spitting Image]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}; New York University Press; 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Berkshire Eagle]]'' review:
:"Well-argued and documented."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Karl Helicher, [[Library Journal]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Images of long-haired antiwar protesters, almost always women, spitting on returning Vietnam veterans have become a shameful part of America's collective memory. Lembcke (sociology, Holy Cross Univ.), a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, here presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America's loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke's most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation?a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged?as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as The Deer Hunter and Coming Home. This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Spitting-Image-Memory-Vietnam/dp/product-description/0814751474/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books Editorial reviews - The Spitting Image]; Amazon Books - Product Overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Isserman]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The myth of the spat-upon veteran is not only bad history, but it has been instrumental in selling the American public on bad policy.&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian G. Appy]], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke's debunking of the spitting stories is quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as "empathetic and mutually supporting." It is certainly true that a remarkable number of veterans opposed the war, and that the antiwar movement did forge alliances with veterans. It is also true that American culture has given too little in-depth attention to antiwar veterans. But Lembcke insists on a strict either/or argument: Veterans and peaceniks were either enemies or comrades. "Antiwar activists could not have been spitting on veterans while at the same time befriending them in off-base coffeehouses," he writes. [...] My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. [...] I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.&lt;ref name="Appy"&gt;[http://www.wright.edu/~tdung/vn.htm The Muffling of Public Memory in Post-Vietnam America]; ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''; February 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\

[[David Dellinger]] review:
:"The best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Mary Carroll, [[Booklist]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Holy Cross College sociology professor Lembcke can't prove a negative, but he makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. Lembcke, a Nam vet who was active in Vietnam Veterans Against the War, opens with Persian Gulf War politicians' use of "the spitting image" and then traces Nixon and Agnew's agitated response to antiwar activism by GIs and veterans. He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; "the spitting image" epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war. With development of a new psychiatric diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, a good vet/bad vet split was complete, and Hollywood films shifted attention from the war itself to its GI victims.&lt;ref name="Amazon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Sufis''''' is one of the best known books on [[Sufism]] by the writer [[Idries Shah]]. First published in 1964 with an introduction by [[Robert Graves]], it introduced Sufi ideas to the West in a format acceptable to non-specialists at a time when the study of Sufism had largely become the reserve of Orientalists.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''The Sufis'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
Eschewing a purely academic approach, Shah gave an overview of Sufi concepts, with potted biographies of some of the most important Sufis over the ages, including [[Rumi]] and [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-Arabi]], while simultaneously presenting the reader with Sufi teaching materials, such as traditional stories or the jokes from the [[Nasreddin|Mullah Nasrudin]] corpus. The book also gave details of previously unsuspected Sufic influences on Western culture. According to Shah, the [[Freemasons]], [[Cervantes]], Western [[chivalry]], [[alchemy]] and Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], amongst others, were all influenced directly or indirectly by Sufis and Sufi ideas, often as a result of contact between East and West in the Middle Ages in places such as Spain or [[Sicily]].

==Reception==
The book had a powerful impact on many thinkers and artists when it appeared, including the [[Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Doris Lessing]], the poet [[Ted Hughes]] and the writer [[Geoffrey Grigson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Lessing described it as "the best introduction to the body of Shah's work", adding that by reading it one was "forced to use one's mind in a new way". Award-winning author [[Doris Lessing]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described it as "a seminal book of the century, even a watershed."&lt;ref name="Washington-Post-Lessing"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Smoley and [[Jay Kinney]], writing in ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'' (2006), pronounced ''The Sufis'' an "extremely readable and wide-ranging introduction to Sufism", adding that "Shah's own slant is evident throughout, and some historical assertions are debatable (none are footnoted), but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in Sufism for the general reader."&lt;ref name="HW250-251"&gt;{{cite book

Richard C. Munn, reviewing the book in the ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', concluded that "One cannot approach this book either in the role of scholar or in the role of seeker (nut), for the author has cleverly blocked both these 'postural' approaches, much in the same way, one suspects, as a Sufi shaikh would. If the Sufi essence is untranslatable into book form, it naturally remains so, but Idries Shah, by 'playing' with the reader, and 'scattering' his points of information, has perhaps given the reader an inkling of Sufi 'experience'."&lt;ref name="Munn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munn|first=Richard C.|date=January–March 1969|title=Reviewed work(s): The Sufis by Idries Shah|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|publisher=American Oriental Society|volume=89|issue=1|pages=279–281|jstor=598339|doi=10.2307/598339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiftieth anniversary (1964–2014)==
2014 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of ''The Sufis''. New paperback and ebook editions of the work were published that year by the newly-formed ISF Publishing, in association with [[The Idries Shah Foundation]], to coincide with that event.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera50"&gt;{{cite web

Part of a wider initiative, The Idries Shah Foundation had begun to make available new paperback and ebook editions of Shah's many books in English, along with translations into other Western languages, and also into Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Turkish.&lt;ref name="TISF-1"&gt;{{cite web

In an article on the [[Al Jazeera]] web site, John Bell and John Zada write about the wave of intolerant militance and extremism in the East and in Africa and about the destruction of many cultural resources such as libraries and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] shrines and mosques in places like [[Timbuktu]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera50" /&gt;

Explaining the historical, rich and diverse background of the tolerant Sufi tradition, the authors suggest that the material in Shah's book provides a useful and most-timely counterpoint and antidote to such extremism in the East; to consumerism in the West; and to intolerance, dogmatism and closed thinking, which they and Shah see as material, mental and emotional "prisons".&lt;ref name="AlJazeera50"/&gt;

In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Jason Webster is also of the opinion that the Sufi Way, as it is known, is a natural antidote to fanaticism.&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;

Webster states that classical Islamic Sufis include (amongst many others) the poet and Persian polymath [[Omar Khayyám]], the Andalusian polymath [[Averroes|Avërroes]], the Persian poet and hagiographer [[Attar of Nishapur|Fariduddin Attar]], and the Persian poet and theologian [[Rumi|Jalāl ad-Dīn Rumi]].&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;  The reviewer also notes that when ''The Sufis'' first appeared, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared the book "a seminal book of the century", and that the work attracted writers such as [[Doris Lessing]], [[J. D. Salinger]] and [[Geoffrey Grigson]]. The poet [[Ted Hughes]] also described it as "astonishing" and wrote that "The Sufis must be the biggest society of sensible men on Earth." According to the reviewer, others in the West drawn to or influenced by Sufism include [[St Francis of Assisi]], the novelist, poet and playwright [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the poet and diplomat [[Sir Richard Burton]], the leading British politician [[Winston Churchill]], and the diplomat and economist [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;

"'''Thematic elements'''", or "'''thematic material'''", is a term used by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and other film ratings boards to highlight elements of a film that do not fit into the traditional categories such as violence, sex, drug use and language, but may involve some degree of objectionable content.  This rating reason raises a warning to parents and guardians to learn more about a film before they allow their children to view it.&lt;ref name=MPAA/&gt; 

These thematic elements may include [[autism]], [[death]], [[disease]], [[discrimination]], [[self-harm]], [[wikt:defiance|defiance]], [[child abuse]], [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]], [[driving under the influence]], [[sexually transmitted infection|STDs]], [[hatred|hate]], [[coming of age|coming-of-age issues]], [[crime]], [[corruption]], [[verbal abuse]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[addiction]], [[disability]], [[hazing]], [[infidelity]], [[politics]], [[social issue]]s, [[abortion]], [[religion]], and other serious subjects or mature discussions that some parents and guardians feel may not be appropriate for their young children.&lt;ref name=MPAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) FAQ|url=http://filmratings.org/filmRatings_Cara/#/ratings/faq/|work=|publisher=MPAA|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
Films with strong thematic elements include ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', ''[[Zootopia]]'', ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'', ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'', ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'', ''[[Hop (film)|Hop]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Warrior (2011 film)|Warrior]]'', ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', ''[[White Oleander (film)|White Oleander]]'', ''[[42 (film)|42]]'',''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film) | Only Yesterday]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]'', ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'', ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', ''[[The Secret Life of Pets 2]]'' and ''[[Wonder Park]]''. Mild thematic elements appear in many other PG and PG-13-rated drama and, primarily, documentary films.

==Concealed or defaced==
* In March 2007 one of Banksy's early pieces, a 25&amp;nbsp;ft-long artwork featuring a collection of blue shapes with the artist's trademark tag, on the side of garages in Albion Road, [[Easton, Bristol]], was mistakenly painted over by graffiti-removal contractors Nordic. They had been asked by Bristol City Council to tackle graffiti adjacent to the Banksy work, but wrongly targeted the piece itself. Within days someone sprayed the words "''Wot no Banksy?''" over the contractors' plain paintwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6444501.stm|title=Banksy work painted over in error|publisher=BBC|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007 Banksy's famous 2002 piece depicting [[John Travolta]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' characters pointing bananas instead of guns, on a wall near Old Street tube station in London, was painted over by London Transport workmen despite having an estimated value of more than £300,000 at the time. Asked to comment on the mural's destruction, a Transport for London spokesman said "Our graffiti removal teams are staffed by professional cleaners not professional art critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6575345.stm|title=Iconic Banksy image painted over|publisher=BBC|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007 a four-year-old wall mural 25&amp;nbsp;ft long in Cato Street, Easton, Bristol, marketed for sale with its attached house (at 21 Milvart Street) thrown in for free via [http://www.redpropeller.co.uk/ Red Propeller gallery] and was subsequently defaced with red paint. Celebrities had previously expressed interest in buying the work, and the gallery owner contacted  Banksy for permission to  [[Conservation-restoration|restore]] the work. Banksy however declined the offer, stating that overwriting and defacement was an inevitable reality of street art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/46984-banksy-house-art-destroyed |title=Bansky house art destroyed |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2007 a mural of a policeman stopping and searching a young girl in [[Glastonbury]], created in connection with the [[Glastonbury Festival]], was whitewashed over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/somerset/content/image_galleries/banksy_gallery.shtml?1 |title=Banksy destroyed |publisher=BBC |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008 ''The Little Diver'' or ''Diving Bell'', previously [[Conservation-restoration#Caring for cultural heritage|protected]] with a perspex sheet by [[Melbourne City Council]] in Australia, incensing many street artists, was covered with silver paint poured behind the sheet and later tagged with the slogan "Banksy woz ere". The image was almost completely obliterated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-painter-painted-melbourne-loses-its-treasured-banksy-20081213-6xzy.html |title=The painted painted: Melbourne loses its treasured Bansky |author=Houghton, Janae |work=[[The Age]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/guerillas-with-the-mist-breed-banksy-rats-20100428-ts54.html |title=Guerillas with the mist breed Banksy rats |author=Levy, Megan |author2=Hunter, Thomas |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=11 March 2011 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In April 2009 ''[[One Nation Under CCTV]]'', an April 2008 mural, was removed (painted over) after London's [[Westminster City Council]] had stated in October 2008 that it would remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that Banksy "has no more right to paint graffiti than a child." Robert Davis, chairman of the council planning committee told [[The Times]] newspaper: "If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art."&lt;ref name="SMHOct2008"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/banksy-art-is-graffiti-rules-council/2008/10/24/1224351528852.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Banksy art is graffiti, rules town hall |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banksy MIld Mild West and poster.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Mild Mild West]]'' in 2007]]

* One of Banksy's earliest, best known and most prominent works, ''[[The Mild Mild West]]'', featuring a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail containing a bunch of flowers at police, located on the side of a building in Cheltenham Road, Bristol, was twice defaced with paint during 2009. It was cleaned up both times, but was damaged in the process; the paint used to attack it is still visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_7985000/7985625.stm |title=Banksy art vandalism is 'stupid' |work=[[BBC]] |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2009 a mural of the [[British Royal Family]], featured on the cover of a single by [[Blur (band)|Blur]], was accidentally painted over by workmen employed by [[Hackney Council]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8238896.stm |title=Blur Banksy ruined by mistake |work=[[BBC]] |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Parachuting Rat]]'', one of the last surviving example of Banksy's [[Melbourne]] street art, accidentally painted over by council contractors in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2887629.htm |title=Melbourne debates street art |author=Fitzsimmons, Hamish |date=30 April 2010 |work=[[ABC Online]] |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/asia/australia/2010/04/29/254488/Australian-officials.htm |title=Australian officials apologise over Banksy blunder |work=[[The China Post]] |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2011 a mural behind Westwood Village Urban Outfitters in [[Westwood Village, Los Angeles]], depicting a child holding a machine gun loaded with coloured crayons, was defaced with black paint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/02/banksy_art_vandalized.php |title=Banksy Boy-With-Gun Art in Westwood Vandalized |author=Romero, Dennis |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; just days before the [[83rd Academy Awards]] for which his documentary film ''[[Exit Through The Gift Shop]]'' had been nominated.
* In May 2011 a Banksy piece drawn in October 2010 around an extractor fan on the Grosvenor Hotel in [[Torquay]] was destroyed. It depicted a child drawing a robot. Within a week of its appearance the owners announced plans to cover it with protective perspex amid newspaper speculation that it had increased the value of the property by £150,000.&lt;ref name=GrafPropPrices /&gt; Vandals smashed the perspex screen on 31 May 2011 to attack the mural with paint stripper, removing the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-13600013 |title=Banksy art destroyed |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2011 |date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 6 July 2010, ''[[Gorilla in a Pink Mask]]'' (also known as ''Gorilla with Pink Face Mask'') in Fishponds Road, Eastville, Bristol, was painted over by new owners of the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sociorobotics.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/banksy-gorilla-in-eastville-bristol-painted-over/ |title=Banksy 'Gorilla with Pink Face Mask' painted over |author=Meadows, Dean |work=[[Sociorobotics]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – by sheer coincidence on the same day that Bristol Zoo Gardens celebrated its 175th anniversary with "''Wow!

* In August 2013 the Banksy which was defaced in 2012 depicting a child drawing a robot at the Grosvenor Hotel in [[Torquay]] was covered up by the hotel owners as an attempt to stop vandals doing more damage. In 2012 the image of the boy was damaged by vandals throwing acid on it, all that remained was the robot. The robot has now been boarded up and preserved underneath, the hotel owners claim.
* Several other Banksy works in New York City were defaced in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2460471/Banksy-sees-street-artworks-vandalized-New-York.html|title=Two more Banksy pieces damaged|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 15 October 2015, the artwork painted by Banksy in Harringay, London depicting the Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] and his son [[Necmettin Bilal Erdoğan]] portrayed as thieves running off with a big sack full of money, was partially painted over covering both of their faces.
* On January 2016, the Banksy mural at the entrance to the former [[Calais Jungle]] refugee camp, which depicted [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] founder, [[Steve Jobs]], as a refugee, was defaced with the words "LONDON CALLiNG", with Jobs' body taking the place of the ''i''; the body of the ''i'' was not painted but the dot was, partially, covering Jobs' head; further defacement has followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/28/banksy-steve-jobs-mural-calais-jungle-defaced_n_9097626.html|date=29 January 2016|accessdate=12 July 2017|title=Banksy’s Steve Jobs Mural In Calais ‘Jungle’ Defaced With ‘London Calling’ Graffiti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 2 October 2013, on [[Allen Street]] in New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], one of Banksy's works that was part of ''Better Out Than In'' was painted over, the day after Banksy unveiled the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/photos_banksys_lower_east_side_piec.php#photo-1|title=Welcome To New York: Banksy's New PIece Colossally Dissed|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021093418/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/photos_banksys_lower_east_side_piec.php#photo-1|archivedate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 7 October 2013, at the intersection of New York City's [[Bowery]] and [[Delancey Street|Delancey streets]] on the [[Lower East Side]], a stencil by Banksy was tagged over by three vandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/graffiti-artists-deface-banksy-artwork-east-side-article-1.1476932|title=Music - NY Daily News|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the continued defacement, fans have been rushing to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced.&lt;ref name=nytimes_race&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=Racing to See Banksy Graffiti, While It Can Still Be See|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/nyregion/racing-to-see-banksy-graffiti-while-it-can-still-be-seen.html?_r=0|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in [[East New York]], charging money for people to take photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson |first=Cord |title=These Men Are Now Charging People to Look at Banksy's Latest Stencil |url=http://gawker.com/these-men-are-now-charging-people-to-look-at-banksys-l-1443562694 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019141644/http://gawker.com/these-men-are-now-charging-people-to-look-at-banksys-l-1443562694 |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued defacement has prompted some to take matters into their own hands by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caulfield|first=Philip|title=Banksy fans restore Williamsburg ‘geishas’ after tussle with tagger|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-fans-restore-williamsburg-geishas-tussle-tagger-article-1.1488985|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property owners have also gone to some measures to protect the art, including hiring 24-hour guards and installing roll down gates that cover the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYC building owner installs gate, hires guards to save work by elusive graffiti artist Banksy|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lMkzIr_JBfIJ:www.sunjournal.com/news/0001/11/30/nyc-building-owner-installs-gate-hires-guards-save/1439976+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]] (Maine)|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Girl with Balloon'' transformed into ''Love is in the Bin''==
''[[Girl with Balloon]]'', a framed art piece, was sold for $1.4 million at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in London on 5 October 2018. Immediately after the auction ended, a mechanism hidden in the frame was triggered by [[remote control]] and partially shredded the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/arts/design/uk-banksy-painting-sothebys.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage|title=Banksy Painting Self-Destructs After Fetching $1.4 Million at Sotheby’s|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy later explained that he had built the shredder into the painting several years before it went up for auction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-explains-prank-shredded-girl-with-balloon-sothebys-auction-a8572956.html|title=Banksy explains why and how he destroyed artwork that had just been sold for £1m|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named the new artwork created by the shredding ''[[Love is in the Bin]]''.
