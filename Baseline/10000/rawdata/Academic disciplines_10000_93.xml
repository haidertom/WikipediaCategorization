'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R.

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Daniel McCarthy ===
Daniel McCarthy is the editor of ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]],'' director of the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Program at [[The Fund for American Studies]], and former editor of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (2010 – 2016).&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism and anarchism share some historical background, as reactions against liberalism, and they share some critiques of liberalism.&amp;nbsp; It’s not that liberalism — broadly construed to include the “classical” variety in practice as well as the modern version — is the worst socio-political system imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The various totalitarianisms of the 20th century were far worse, and anarchists and conservatives alike have to be careful that in making a deep critique of liberalism they’re not opening the door to something far deadlier. But liberalism is not the end of history, and it’s not the final picture of justice.&amp;nbsp;Under the guise of democracy and markets, and human rights, various kinds of powers and interests are able to run quite unchecked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Alexander Salter ===
Alexander Salter is Assistant Professor of Economics in the [[Rawls College of Business]], and the Comparative Economics Research Fellow at [[Texas Tech University]]'s Free Market Institute.&lt;blockquote&gt;Embracing anarchy does not require conservatives to embrace violent revolution, or even civil disobedience. But for their own sake, as well as the sake of the civilization which they love, conservatives can and should deny the state’s legitimacy, on the grounds that it is destructive of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Affirming sovereignty in the hopes it may someday fall within conservative hands is a siren song that must be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/10/conservatism-seek-destroy-state-alexander-salter.html|title=Should Conservatism Seek to Destroy the State? ~ The Imaginative Conservative|date=2017-10-17|work=The Imaginative Conservative|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Architectural Association of [[Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]] ({{lang-ms| Persatuan Senibina Universiti Teknologi Malaysia}} or PSUTM), more commonly known as '''Architech''', is the official association for students of architecture in UTM. It was formed in the 70s during the Kuala Lumpur days, and one of the earliest students association to be registered under Office of Students' Affair (HEMA, previously HEP), and is acknowledged as one of the most active students association in UTM. It resides within the [[Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]], under the Faculty of Built Environment.

==Role==
The main role of Architech is to manage the welfare of the UTM architecture students, organize events of various forms for the benefits of its members, to become the voice of the students in the school, and ultimately to ensure the advancement of non-academic qualities amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mat Yasir|first=Azari|title=Workbase Booklet 2011/12|year=2011|publisher=Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia|location=Johor, Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
The Architech logo was a result of a design competition held by the association in 1992, initiated by the president at the time, Zulhisham and Che Wan Ahmad Faizal. At the time, the name Architech have not come into being, and the logo competition was actually for PSUTM. The prize advertised was RM200, however the participations were poor and uninspiring (less than 20 entries), hence no winner was picked. Instead, Che Wan Ahmad Faizal then approached Fauzee Nasir to design a logo worthy for the association.

Using Aldus Freehand 2.0. on a classic Mac, Fauzee designed the logo, incorporating the name Architech for the first time. This was the first instance of the name in use. The logo and the name Architech was accepted by the general population, and remains in use until now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nasir|first=Fauzee|title=Asal Usul Logo Architech|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=566.0|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo utilizes simple and straightforward [[typography]], using [[Times New Roman]], beginning with a capital A and with italic type applied to the last four letters. The letters "Archi" will normally be black on white/light background, or white on black/dark background. The letters "tech" will normally be red, or gray in monochrome print.

===Rights and Ownership===
The Architech logo was designed and still owned by [[Fauzee Nasir]] until today. In a deal struck with the association, the association agreed not to pay the RM200 prize money to Fauzee Nasir as the design was not part of the competition. Hence, the designer retains ownership and rights to the logo. However, in a mutual agreement the designer gave right to use and reproduce the logo as long as it is not for commercial use. Any commercial use must have written permission from the designer.

==Student Composition==
Architech members consist of the entire population of architecture students in UTM, as students enrolled in the programme are automatically registered under it unless otherwise requested. Previously it also included students of landscape architecture until they formed their own students society in the late 1990s. When the diploma programme was shifted to UTM KL campus under the [[Razak School]], the diploma students formed their own society called ARCO, which was intended as a sister society to Architech. However, due to logistics problem, especially since both are now under two different schools, ARCO became an independent body, but maintained close relations with Architech.

===Sub-communities===
Below is the list of students batches and name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?board=40.0 List of Subcommunities in Tanggam&lt;/ref&gt; (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, it made more sense to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year).
* 1993 - UTM87/88
* 1994 - Batch88/89
* 1995 - Archi890
* 1996 - HUHA901

Beyond this the programme has been restructured into a 3-year (instead of 5 year) programme. It has not been decided on how or what convention to use for the 2-year M.Arch programme at this moment, particularly since it has two intakes per year (effectively two graduating batches annually as well).

Architech is led by its president, democratically elected amongst its members for a term of one year. The president is assisted by the vice president, secretary and treasurer, all of which are democratically elected as well. Together, they will form their government, electing individuals of various skills into official positions where their skills could be harnessed for the benefit of the society. These positions evolve and vary throughout the years to meet any needs.

* Technical - in charge of management of technical aspects, such as asset, equipment and facilities management.
* Graphics - in charge of spearheading the graphical movement and activities.
* Sports - in charge of sporting events, be it competitive or recreational.

==Publications==
===Architext===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Architext frontpage August1997.jpg|thumb|right|The front page of 'Architext' dated August 1997.]]  --&gt;Architext was initiated as a periodical newsletter for Architech. It started around 1997, led by Roshida Majid and advised by Dr. Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi. Copies of the first two issues were lost; #3 was the earliest remaining copy today. It was distributed free bilingually in Bahasa Malaysia and English, featured several articles relating to architectural studies, listed events and activities, as well as a cartoon sketch.

Architext was never resumed and was presumably forgotten, until recently some of its original members began discussing of bringing it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Johnson|title=Architext|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=4168.0|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Folio===
The Design Folio is a publication collecting selected students' thesis works from a particular year. It is published with the notion of showcasing works based on specific theme for each publication. Students works are then selected based on the theme, ideally spanning between three and five years of thesis works. However, in its two innumeration, the selection is limited within a group of students in a particular year.

The publication is intended for commercial publications. The editorial consists of entirely students from the thesis group, advised and consulted by the Thesis Coordinators. To date, there have been two successful publications: the first in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamaruddin]|first=[editor, Syahril Nizam|title=Alternative : a design folio 2005|year=2005|publisher=Skywriting studio|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|isbn=983-42507-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the second in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ariffin|first=consultant editor, Syed Ahmad Iskandar Syed|title="A" for architecture an alternative book : design thesis folio 2007|year=2008|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Press|location=Skudai, Johor Darul Ta'zim|isbn=978-983-52-0480-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was another manuscript managed to be completed in 2008, however due to funding limitations, it did not get published.

==Anthem==
The association have adopted a song written by one of the students in the late 80s, Zuhairi Harun. The song was titled 'Warisan', touching on the struggle of heritage and identity of architecture in Malaysia. The song have gone through a number of renditions, including quickening of tempo and change of melody, however the spirit of the song remains.

==Activities==
===Architectural Workshop===
The architectural workshop is an annual national gatherings of architectural students in Malaysia. It began in 1987 in UTM, using the format of a jamboree, organised by Persatuan Arkitek (Architech) in Kuala Lumpur. Concurrently during the workshop, the PAM-Education Liaison Meeting would also take place to take advantage of the gatherings of students from various schools in one location.

Architech was the pioneer of the architectural workshop, which exists until today. The last architectural workshop hosted by Architech was in June 2011 using the theme "Terang". It was the biggest architectural workshop ever hosted by Architech, involving over 24 schools of architecture from all over Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=400 penuntut 'terangi' Johor Bahru|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0622&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Johor&amp;pg=wj_01.htm|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officiated by PAM Vice President Ar.

At the moment, it is undecided on when the next hosting by Architech will be, but it is estimated around 2016.

An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]]. [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]] in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to [[late modernism]]&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to that period after the "modern" period called contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', – 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern period began during [[late modernism]] (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"&gt;William R. Everdell, [[The First Moderns|''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'']], University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of time corresponding to "modern art" each consecutive movement was often considered a new [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution. Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-Gardes" introduction, Martin Puchner] Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml "Looking at Artists' Manifestos, 1945–1965", Stephen B. Petersen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927185416/http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml |date=September 27, 2011 }} Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes from [[art critic]]s and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980). His final essay on modernism Retrieved October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern art|Postmodernist]] theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'' by Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or just a passing fad.&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/The_Death_of_Postmodernism_And_Beyond Alan Kirby, ''The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

== Manifesto ==
The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments was produced by the participants of the First International Congress 
of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments organized by the International Museums Office and held in Athens in 1931.
The seven points of the manifesto were:

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism 
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored. 
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

Under acidic conditions, [[aluminium]] becomes more soluble and [[phosphate]] less. As a consequence, calcicoles grown on acidic soils often develop the symptoms of aluminium [[toxicity]], i.e. [[necrosis]], and phosphate deficiency, i.e. [[anthocyanosis]] (reddening of the leaves) and stunting.

A plant that thrives in acid soils is known as a [[calcifuge]].

A plant thriving on sand (which may be acidic or calcic) is termed psammophilic or arenaceous (see also [[arenite]]).

==Examples of calcicole plants==
* Ash trees (''[[Fraxinus]]'' spp.) 
* Honeysuckle (''[[Lonicera]]'') 
* ''[[Buddleja]]'' 
* Lilac (''[[Syringa]]'')
* [[Beet]]
* ''[[Clematis]]''
* ''[[Sanguisorba minor]]''
* Some European [[orchid]]s
* Some [[succulent plant]]s genera ''[[Sansevieria]]'' and ''[[Titanopsis]]'' or [[cactaceae|cacti]] genus ''[[Thelocactus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''CITBOK''') is the project sponsored and undertaken by [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS) to define and outline the [[body of knowledge]] that defines a Canadian [[Information Systems Professional]] (ISP).

CIPS recognizes that in order to strengthen the criteria of the ISP designation successfully while still maintaining high standards, the association needs to develop a Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge (CITBOK) that will set standards for knowledge.  The CITBOK is an outline of the knowledge bases that form the intellectual basis for the IT profession.  CIPS has identified a core CITBOK that all professionals would be expected to master and specialty bodies of knowledge that would depend on your area of practice.  When setting this Canadian standard for Information Technology (IT) knowledge, CIPS looked to other organizations and internationally for standards and bodies of knowledge that CIPS could adopt or adapt, especially for the specialty areas.  For example, in 2004, CIPS adopted the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) Professional Examination Study Guide Syllabus Diploma level (Core and 11 specialist modules) as the initial Body of Knowledge for CIPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |title=Moving towards a Canadian IT Body of Knowledge |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230307/http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITBOK aims to:

* be an industry structure model that can be used to define the set of performance, training and development standards for all IT practitioners (CIPS members and non-members) in [[Canada]];
* create alternate paths to certification based on concepts of CITBOK;
* establish guidelines for accreditation criteria based on concepts of CITBOK; and
* create a professional development model that sets the standards criteria for the knowledge base including knowledge, skills, and professional activities for IT practitioners.

== Career ==
She first thought of becoming a sex surrogate partner after reading ''Surrogate Wife: The Story of a Masters &amp; Johnson Sexual Therapist and the Nine Cases She Treated'' by Valerie Scott. In 1973 she took San Francisco Sex Information's (SFSI) training, and was a member of their training staff for 20 years. She studied the work of [[Masters and Johnson]], and works with many of the San Francisco Bay Area's premiere [[sex therapist]]s.

Cohen Greene is a certified Clinical Sexologist and a sex surrogate partner. Her official title is Surrogate Partner Therapist. She is a  member of IPSA (International Professional Surrogates Association). In October 2004 she received her 'Doctorate in Human Sexuality' from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. She has stated about her profession: "People have asked me over the years, 'How do you work with people who are differently abled?' I always say, it's not hard for me. I just have to learn what their special needs are."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31366">A '''Collections Management System''' ('''CMS'''), sometimes called a '''Collections Information System''', is [[software]] used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts.  Collecting institutions are primarily [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies.  Secondarily, [[libraries]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are also collecting institutions.   Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Sully | first=Perian | date=8 July 2006 | url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf | title=Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software | publisher=[[John F. Kennedy University]] | page=8 | accessdate=19 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In larger institutions, the CMS may be used by collections staff such as [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and [[curators]] to record information such as object locations, [[provenance]], curatorial information, conservation reports, professional appraisals, and exhibition histories. All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010).

==Development and history of collections management systems==
Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1967, the [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[IBM]] conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, pp. 23-24. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,"&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this time some of today’s popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio] for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s [[Monticello]] — before being released as commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 19. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, with computers becoming faster and cheaper and with the rise of the Internet, collections management software became much more sophisticated, able to “present images, sort information in any one of a myriad of configurations, record exhibition information, track locations, and interface with a museum Website."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 40. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the goal during the 1960s was to use computers for collections record-keeping for purposes of accountability, MCN Executive Director [[Everett Ellin]] warned that museum professionals should include public access as a goal because it would “not be worth the effort if museums only create a glorified record-keeping system."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 26. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems have become crucial tools in increasing public access to collections information, expanding the types of information that are recorded. What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects," including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “[[Content management system|Content Management System]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

==Information managed in collections management systems==
In 1997, art historian and museum information studies consultant Robert A. Baron outlined the requirements for Collections Management Systems, not as a list of the kinds of collections object information that should be recorded, but rather as a list of collections activities such as administration, loan, exhibition, preservation, and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;Swank, Annamaria Poma (September 2008).

Retrieved 15 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN) Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist (CMSCC), which aims to be a comprehensive list of the kinds of information that a museum may want to record in a CMS, organizes that list by processes and actions rather than type of information. The checklist “outlines a number of features commonly included in a commercial CMS, which can assist a museum in determining which features have priority.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

===Object entry===
Managing and documenting information and tasks related to objects entering the museum, including acquisition or loan records, receipts, record of the reason for the deposit of the object, and record of the object’s return to its owner.

===Acquisition===
The management and documentation of objects added to the institution’s collection, including [[Accession number (library science)|accession numbers]], catalog numbers, object name or title, acquisition date, acquisition method, and transfer of title. There are many different accession numbering systems, and a CMS should allow an institution to use its existing numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory control===
Identification of objects for which the institution has a legal responsibility, including loaned objects and objects that have not been accessioned. Information recorded includes object location and status.

===Location and movement control===
Records of an object’s current and past locations within the institution's premises so that it can be located, including dates of movement and authorizations for movement.

===Catalog description===
Information that describes and identifies objects, including creator/maker/artist, date(s) of creation, place of creation, provenance, object history, research on the object, and connections to other objects.

===Conservation management===
The management of information about an object’s conservation “from a curatorial and [[Collections management (museum)|collections management]] perspective," including conservation requests, examination records, condition reports, records of preventative actions, and treatment histories.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk management===

Management of information about potential threats to collections objects, including documentation of specific threats, records of preventative measures, disaster plans and procedures, and emergency contacts.

===Insurance management and valuation control===

Documentation of insurance needs for objects for which the institution is responsible (included loaned objects) as well as the monetary value of objects for insurance purposes. This may include the names and contact information of appraisers as well as appraisal history.

===Exhibition management===
Management of an object’s exhibition or display, including exhibition history and documentation of research done on an object for an exhibition. More advanced Collections Management Systems may have the ability to present information from the system on a museum’s website or in an online exhibit.

===Dispatch/shipping/transport===
Management of objects leaving the institution’s premises and being transferred to a different location, including location information, packing notes, crate dimensions, authorizations, customs information and documenting the means of transportation (including courier information).&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loaning and borrowing===

Managing the temporary transfer of responsibility of an object from the museum to another institution or vice versa, including loan agreements, loan history, records of costs and payments, packing lists, and records of overdue loans.

===Deaccessioning and disposal===
Management and documentation of objects being [[Deaccessioning|deaccessioned]] and leaving the institution’s collection, either by transfer, sale, exchange, or destruction/loss, including transfer of title, records of approval, and reason for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of collections management systems==

===Functionality===

A Collections Management System should be able to store data, edit data, delete data, access data through queries, sort data, and output data in the form of reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), pp. 117-118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Data is stored in the form of tables and is entered into the system (and sometimes edited) using forms. Queries are searches that help retrieve specific data from the system, and reports “are the means by which the results of a query are displayed or printed."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file’s location recorded in the CMS.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed.

===Backup and redundancy===
A CMS should have "a built in backup and recovery process" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data standards===
Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and [[metadata standards]] should be applied in a Collections Management System.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise [[information retrieval]] and for easier exchange of data between different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value:

* Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DC), [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), the [[MARC standards|MARC]] formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA ([[Visual Resources Association]]) Core Categories.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]] (DACS).
* Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of [[authority lists]], lexicons, [[Data Dictionaries|data dictionaries]], and thesauri. Examples include the Getty’s [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) and [[Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and [[Iconclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the [[Darwin Core]] standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.&lt;ref&gt;Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin Core]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘[[CIDOC]]’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”&lt;ref&gt;Adlib Software. [http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software Adlib Museum]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and access===
A Collections Management System should have security measures that “ensure that only authorized persons are able to enter, edit, or view” information contained in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The system should allow the public to be able to make and refine searches of publicly accessible information in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and reproductions===

A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or [[Creative Commons license]]), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when selecting a system==
Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a [[needs assessment]] before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), [https://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?] ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/select-museum-cms-start-with-needs-assessment/|title=Start Your Museum CMS Selection Process with a Needs Assessment |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation information management systems==
Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

Many Collections Management System developers have responded to this need by adding requested conservation features to their products. For example, in 2009, Gallery Systems, the developer of The Museum System (TMS), formed a consortium of stakeholders called the Conservation Working Group, to create a set of features to add to the conservation module of TMS.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems (2015). [http://www.gallerysystems.com/a-brief-history-of-conservation-studio/ A Brief History of Conservation Studio]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservators and institutions have taken a different approach, customizing existing software so that the system can manage conservation workflows. For example, at the [[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]] in 2012, former collections database administrator Kate Collen modified The Museum Systems’ conservation module so that it could manage object treatment processes, including assigning roles and responsibilities to multiple staff, ordering and prioritizing conservation tasks and treatments, separating treatment images from object images, automating registrar and lender approvals for treatments, and even tracking staff hours. This was achieved by renaming and remapping fields in the existing system, in some cases using fields for different purposes than originally intended by the software developer.&lt;ref&gt;Collen, Kate (2012). [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vsnd3jf5g7rssr/Collen%2C%20Kate%20%282012%29.%20Making%20Conservation%20Work.pdf?dl=0 Making Conservation Work: Configuring the Conservation Module for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum]. Retrieved 14, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software developers have been developing standalone systems specifically for the purpose of managing conservation information and tasks. Since 2000, Inventive Software Solutions has been developing the Conservation Tracker System for the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to be “a comprehensive digital management tool for art conservation documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Inventive Software Solutions. [http://www.inventivesoftware.net/Products/ConservationTracker.aspx Conservation Tracker System Overview]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed since 2009 as a program of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], ConservationSpace is a project “to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared solution to the problem of documentation management.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationspace.org/Home.html ConservationSpace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219041630/http://conservationspace.org/Home.html |date=2014-12-19 }}. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gallery Systems decided that adding incremental conservation features to The Museum System was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of conservators and began to develop a standalone web-based system to manage conservation processes called TMS Conservation Studio, which was released in summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems.

{{Anarchism sidebar}}
'''Collectivist anarchism''' (also known as '''anarcho-collectivism''') is a [[revolutionary]]&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"&gt;Bakunin Mikail. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Thus notwithstanding the title, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "collectivist anarchism" is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: ''The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12–15}} Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First National.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: {{quote|[W]e must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

These ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as [[Marxism|Marxists]] were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a "rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=marxists.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent" and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people".&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]], adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s [[class analysis]] and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx’s genius", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government", in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm No profile created for this contactAnarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One |]. Black Rose Books. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full [[communism]]. The anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892.

Bakunin's socialism was known as "collectivist anarchism", where "socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm ''Revolutionary Catechism''], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"/&gt;

=== Critique of Marxism ===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{quote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society [[Classless society|without social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]]; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: {{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader".&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'&lt;/ref&gt; Marx wrote to [[Friedrich Engels]] of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine".

Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[proletariat]]. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|title="Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict – Part Two" by Ann Robertson.|website=workerscompass.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statism and Anarchy.jpg|thumb|''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'' by Bakunin, Russian first print (1873)]]

=== Comparison with anarcho-communism ===
The difference between collectivist anarchism and [[anarcho-communism]] is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of "to each according to his labor", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim "to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Guess, Raymond; Skinner, Quentin. The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings. Cambridge University Press. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of [[labour voucher]]s or "personal credit" (such as [[Participatory economics|participatory economists]]). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would "guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue for [[workplace autonomy]] and self-management "the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Performance ==
Application of many collectivist anarchists projects have been successful&lt;ref name="libcom.org"&gt;"Workers Power and the Spanish Revolution," by Tom Wetzel, http://libcom.org/library/workers-power-and-the-spanish-revolution-tom-wetzel&lt;/ref&gt; as sources during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] noted in the Catalan region: {{quote|In distribution the collectives' co-operatives eliminated middlemen, small merchants, wholesalers, and profiteers, thus greatly reducing consumer prices. The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tom Wetzel describes another collectivization: {{quote|Another industry that was totally re-organized was hair-cutting. Before July 19th, there had been 1,100 hairdressing parlors in Barcelona, most of them extremely marginal. The 5,000 assistant hairdressers were among the lowest-paid workers in Barcelona. The Generalitat had decreed a 40-hour week and 15 percent wage increase after July 19th—one of the Esquerra’s attempts to woo worker support. This spelled ruin for many hairdressing shops. A general assembly was held and it was agreed to shut down all the unprofitable shops. The 1,100 shops were replaced by a network of 235 neighborhood haircutting centers, with better equipment and lighting than the old shops. Due to the efficiencies gained, it was possible to raise wages by 40 percent. The entire network was run through assemblies of the CNT barber’s union. The former owners became members of the union.&lt;ref name="libcom.org"/&gt;}}

'''Contact guidance''' refers to a phenomenon for which the orientation of cells and [[stress fiber]]s is influenced by geometrical patterns such as nano/microgrooves on substrates, or collagen fibers in gels and soft tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=J.

Nevertheless, the biological processes underlying contact guidance are still unclear.

==Contact guidance on two-dimensional substrates==
When cells are seeded onto flat substrates, they generally exhibit a random orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LOESBERG|first1=W|last2=TERIET|first2=J|last3=VANDELFT|first3=F|last4=SCHON|first4=P|last5=FIGDOR|first5=C|last6=SPELLER|first6=S|last7=VANLOON|first7=J|last8=WALBOOMERS|first8=X|last9=JANSEN|first9=J|title=The threshold at which substrate nanogroove dimensions may influence fibroblast alignment and adhesion|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=27|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.030|pmid=17576010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when substrates have topographical patterns, the orientation of cells cultured on these surfaces is influenced by these geometrical cues. For example, if a substrate has nano/microgrooves running parallel to each other, cells orient along the direction of these topographical patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=den Braber|first1=E.T.|last2=de Ruijter|first2=J.E.|last3=Smits|first3=H.T.J.|last4=Ginsel|first4=L.A.|last5=von Recum|first5=A.F.|last6=Jansen|first6=J.A.|title=Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation and orientation on substrata with uniform parallel surface micro-grooves|journal=Biomaterials|date=June 1996|volume=17|issue=11|pages=1093–1099|doi=10.1016/0142-9612(96)85910-2|pmid=8718969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walboomers|first1=X.

A similar effect can be obtained when cells are cultured on flat surfaces with lines of proteins printed on top (to which cells can adhere), interspersed by repellent lines; also in that case, cells align along the patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimerman|first1=B.|last2=Arnold|first2=M.|last3=Ulmer|first3=J.|last4=Blümmel|first4=J.|last5=Besser|first5=A.|last6=Spatz|first6=J.P.|last7=Geiger|first7=B.|title=Formation of focal adhesion-stress fibre complexes coordinated by adhesive and non-adhesive surface domains|journal=IEE Proceedings - Nanobiotechnology|date=2004|volume=151|issue=2|pages=62|doi=10.1049/ip-nbt:20040474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alford|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Nesmith|first2=Alexander P.|last3=Seywerd|first3=Johannes N.|last4=Grosberg|first4=Anna|last5=Parker|first5=Kevin Kit|title=Vascular smooth muscle contractility depends on cell shape|journal=Integrative Biology|date=2011|volume=3|issue=11|pages=1063|doi=10.1039/c1ib00061f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been observed that the phenomenon of contact guidance on microgrooved surfaces is influenced by the groove width. For instance, osteoblast-like cells align along the nanogrooves only for grooves wider than 75&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar behavior has been observed with other cell types, such as fibroblasts, which align along these topographical patterns when the grooves are wider than 150&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LOESBERG|first1=W|last2=TERIET|first2=J|last3=VANDELFT|first3=F|last4=SCHON|first4=P|last5=FIGDOR|first5=C|last6=SPELLER|first6=S|last7=VANLOON|first7=J|last8=WALBOOMERS|first8=X|last9=JANSEN|first9=J|title=The threshold at which substrate nanogroove dimensions may influence fibroblast alignment and adhesion|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=27|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.030|pmid=17576010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too large values of groove widths can also decrease the effects of contact guidance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charest|first1=Joseph L.|last2=García|first2=Andrés J.|last3=King|first3=William P.|title=Myoblast alignment and differentiation on cell culture substrates with microscale topography and model chemistries|journal=Biomaterials|volume=28|issue=13|pages=2202–2210|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.020|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.020|pmid=17267031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact guidance in three-dimensional structures==
Cells can orient in response to contact guidance also when located inside three-dimensional structures, such as collagen gels, scaffolds, and soft tissues. For those conditions, it has been demonstrated that the geometrical cues provided by collagen or scaffold fibers are able to influence the orientation of cells. For example, it has been observed that endothelial colony forming cells align along the direction of the fibers present in electrospun scaffolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fioretta|first1=Emanuela S.|last2=Simonet|first2=Marc|last3=Smits|first3=Anthal I.

==Potential of contact guidance for tissue engineering==
Recent research has highlighted the importance of cellular alignment for the mechanical properties and functionality of the prostheses developed using the principles of tissue engineering. Currently, scientists are investigating the mechanisms and potential of contact guidance to control cellular alignment, which would ultimately lead to the control of their cellular forces and certain aspects of collagen remodeling.

==Biological mechanisms determining contact guidance==
Many researchers have formulated hypotheses on the biological mechanisms determining contact guidance. In general, cellular contraction, stress fibers and focal adhesions seem to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barocas|first1=V. H.|last2=Tranquillo|first2=R. T.|title=An Anisotropic Biphasic Theory of Tissue-Equivalent Mechanics: The Interplay Among Cell Traction, Fibrillar Network Deformation, Fibril Alignment, and Cell Contact Guidance|journal=Journal of Biomechanical Engineering|date=1997|volume=119|issue=2|pages=137|doi=10.1115/1.2796072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vigliotti|first1=A.|last2=McMeeking|first2=R. M.|last3=Deshpande|first3=V. S.|title=Simulation of the cytoskeletal response of cells on grooved or patterned substrates|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=11 March 2015|volume=12|issue=105|pages=20141320–20141320|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.1320|pmc=4387521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Feng|last2=Yuan|first2=Lin|last3=Huang|first3=He|last4=Chen|first4=Hong|title=Phenomenon of "contact guidance" on the surface with nano-micro-groove-like pattern and cell physiological effects|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|date=13 September 2009|volume=54|issue=18|pages=3200–3205|doi=10.1007/s11434-009-0366-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a computational model has been developed that is able to simulate the re-alignment of cells and stress fibers on top of grooved surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vigliotti|first1=A.|last2=McMeeking|first2=R. M.|last3=Deshpande|first3=V. S.|title=Simulation of the cytoskeletal response of cells on grooved or patterned substrates|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=11 March 2015|volume=12|issue=105|pages=20141320–20141320|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.1320|pmc=4387521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, it has been supposed that cells, once seeded, form focal adhesions on top of the ridges and not above the grooves. Once formed, the focal adhesions produce a signal that starts to diffuse into the cell inducing stress fiber assembly. At this point, there are two different possibilities, depending on the groove size. On the one hand, when the groove size is small, the intracellular signal produced by focal adhesions on the ridges can homogenously reach all locations in the cell. In that case, the stress fiber assembly is isotropic, and these fibers can pull on their surroundings in an isotropic fashion, and consequently the resulting cell shape is isotropic (without a preferred alignment). On the other hand, when the groove size is relatively large, the intracellular signal cannot reach the locations of the cell situated on top of the grooves, as diffusion is limited. As a result, stress fibers form only close to the ridges, and these acto-myosin bundles pull on their surroundings anisotropically. Due to the anisotropic cellular contraction, stress fibers and cells align along the direction of the microgrooves. Further experiments are necessary to validate this theory.

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Transcendental+theology+aims+either+at+inferring+the+existence+of+a+Supreme+Being+from+a+general+experience,+without+any+closer+reference+to+the+world+to+which+this+experience+belongs,+and+in+this+case%22%22it+is+called+cosmotheology;+or+it+endeavours+to+cognize+the+existence+of+such+a+being,+through+mere+conceptions,+without+the+aid+of+experience,+and+is+then+termed+Ontotheology%22 Section VII: Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6428">The '''County Herb Committees''' were a nationwide medicinal plant collecting scheme, established by the British [[Ministry of Health]] during World War II. 
They were set up at a time when the German occupation of France and the disruption of shipping lanes interfered with drug supplies. As in WWI, the British found that the Germans still largely dominated the pharmaceutical industry and consequently by the early 1940s there were critical shortages of essential medicines in hospitals and homes across Britain.

First the Vegetable Drugs Committee or VDC was established at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], including two Kew experts, Dr Metcalfe and Dr Ronald Melville, botanist and pharmacist. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's Green Allies: Medicinal Plants in Wartime|last1=Ayres|first1=Peter|chapter=6 The Home Front|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NvZBCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=britain's+green+allies,+Supply+of+Vegetable+Drugs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7w9OHyurSAhXlL8AKHewFBXkQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=britain's%20green%20allies%2C%20Supply%20of%20Vegetable%20Drugs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee found that a number of imported drugs were derived from plants that were also native to Britain. By 1941, they were publishing guides for herb collectors in the rural British communities. Various groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Women's Institutes and the elderly, were enlisted as collectors by Sir Arthur Hill, Director of Kew.

In 1941, the wholesale pharmaceutical company Brome and Schimmer published a booklet called ''Herb Gardening'', describing the many roots, flowers and herbs needed by the Ministry of Health, and how to collect and dry them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Green and Pleasant Land: How England's Gardeners Fought the Second World War|chapter=Women and Children Go To It|last1=Buchan|first1=Ursula|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oWxGhBUPQB0C&amp;pg=PT265&amp;lpg=PT265&amp;dq=green+and+pleasant+land+vegetable+drugs+committee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=85wUmsJ8FJ&amp;sig=SASWATbEWFd7sh4i2lhldbK8x-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_-n0yOrSAhUoCcAKHRUPDKAQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20and%20pleasant%20land%20vegetable%20drugs%20committee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Supply]] issued monthly bulletins for rural herb committees that provided information for collecting herbs in different areas. The first bulletin in 1942 described how in Derbyshire "The Hathersage Women's Institutes dried fifty pounds of materials chiefly nettles in the attic of a house, and the Clifton and Mayfield Boy Scouts dried seventy-six pounds of Foxglove at their headquarters. They hope to do much more this year and the county committee is looking around for drying depots." (The cardiac glycosides in Foxglove degrade if the plants are not dried carefully. A leaflet from Kew advised that collectors spread the plants on racks to dry in a coke-heated shed at 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=the Herbal Academy|title=Medicinal Plant Use in World War II|last1=Sumner|first1=Judith|url=https://theherbalacademy.com/medicinal-plant-use-in-world-war-ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A pamphlet that the Vegetable Drugs Committee published in 1941 stated that the most essential medicinal plants needed were belladonna, colchicum, digitalis, hyoscyamus, stramonium and valerian - and that he countries of origin for these plants had previously been Hungary, Italy, Germany and Yugoslavia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's Green Allies: Medicinal Plants in Wartime|last1=Ayres|first1=Peter|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NvZBCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=britain's+green+allies,+Supply+of+Vegetable+Drugs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7w9OHyurSAhXlL8AKHewFBXkQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=britain's%20green%20allies%2C%20Supply%20of%20Vegetable%20Drugs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 70 Committees were set up across England, Scotland and Wales, and grants of a total of £1,191 were made available to set up drying centres that could deal directly with trading companies. By the end of the war, there were 250 drying centres across country. Horticulturist Elizabeth Hess was the Agricultural Organiser for the Women's Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Horwood|title=Gardening Women: Their Stories From 1600 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKqMMceJjukC&amp;pg=PT297|date=6 May 2010|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1833-5|pages=297–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first drying centre in Oxfordshire was in the home of Dr WO James and his wife Gladys in the village of Islip, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The WI|title=Countrywomen in War Time |last1=Stamper|first1=Anne|page=10|url=https://www.thewi.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/11111/countrywomen-in-war-time-womens-institutes-1938-1945-.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|The growth rings of a tree at [[Bristol Zoo]], England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest.]]
'''Dendrochronology'''  (or '''tree-ring dating''') is the [[scientific method]] of [[chronological dating|dating]] tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history.

Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old [[panel painting]]s on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in [[radiocarbon dating]] to calibrate radiocarbon ages.&lt;ref name=Grissino&gt;{{cite|title=The Science of Tree Rings: Principles of Dendrochronology|first=Henri D.|last=Grissino-Mayer|publisher=Department of Geography, The University of Tennessee|date=n.d.|url=http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|accessdate=October 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104042215/http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New growth in [[tree]]s occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.&lt;ref name=Grissino /&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimer |first1=Paula J. |year=2013 |title=IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0–50,000 years cal BP |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=55 |pages=1869–1887 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16947 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516010345/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrochronology derives from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:δένδρον|δένδρον]]}} (''{{lang|la|dendron}}''), meaning "tree", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}} (''{{lang|la|khronos}}''), meaning "time", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''({{lang|la|[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]}}''), "the study of".

== History ==
The Greek botanist [[Theophrastus]] (ca. 371 – ca. 287 BC) first mentioned that the wood of trees has rings.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus with Arthur Hort, trans., ''Enquiry into Plants'', volume 1 (London, England: William Heinemann, 1916), Book V, [https://archive.org/stream/enquiryintoplant01theouoft#page/422/mode/2up p. 423.] From p. 423: "Moreover, the wood of the silver-fir has many layers, like an onion; there is always another beneath that which is visible, and the wood is composed of such layers throughout." Although many sources claim that Theophrastus recognized that trees form growth rings annually, this is not true.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the history of dendrochronology, see:

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the scientific study of tree rings and the application of dendrochronology began. In 1859, the German-American [[Jacob Kuechler]] (1823–1893) used crossdating to examine [[oak]]s (''[[Quercus stellata]]'') in order to study the record of climate in western Texas.&lt;ref&gt;See:

(Both branches that are presented in plate 42, fig. 6 (with the cross-section in fig. 7) and fig. 1 (with the cross-section in fig. 2) had produced, in the defoliation year of 1862, a growth ring that was twice as strong as in the preceding one, and so was the ring of the year-old shoot (not illustrated here) stronger in the case of the defoliated tree than one that was not defoliated.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1882, this observation was already appearing in forestry textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franklin B.

Kapteyn]] (1851–1922) was using crossdating to reconstruct the climates of the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kapteyn, J. C.

During the first half of the 20th century, the astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] founded the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]] at the [[University of Arizona]]. Douglass sought to better understand cycles of sunspot activity and reasoned that changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth, which would subsequently be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns (''i.e.'', sunspots → climate → tree rings).

[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of [[wood]] is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots, to form a growth ring.]]
Horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] cut through the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] can reveal growth rings, also referred to as ''tree rings'' or ''annual rings''. Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the [[season]]s of the year; thus, critical for the title method, one ring generally marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Removal of the bark of the tree in a particular area may cause deformation of the rings as the plant overgrows the scar.

The rings are more visible in trees which have grown in [[temperate zone]]s, where the seasons differ more markedly. The inner portion of a growth ring forms early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as "early wood" (or "spring wood", or "late-spring wood"&lt;ref&gt;"Early wood" is used in preference to "spring wood", as the latter term may not correspond to that time of year in climates where early wood is formed in the early summer (e.g. [[Canada]]) or in autumn, as in some [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] species.&lt;/ref&gt;); the outer portion is the "late wood" (sometimes termed "summer wood", often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is denser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv |last= Capon |first= Brian|title= Botany for Gardeners |year= 2005 |pages= 66–67 |edition= 2nd |isbn= 0-88192-655-8 |publisher= Timber Publishing|location= Portland, OR}} {{better source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pinus taeda crossx7358.JPG|thumb|right|240px|''[[Pinus taeda]]'' Cross section showing annual rings, [[Cheraw, South Carolina]].]]
Many trees in temperate zones produce one growth-ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring, while a drought year may result in a very narrow one.

Direct reading of tree ring chronologies is a complex science, for several reasons. First, contrary to the single-ring-per-year paradigm, alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid-summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. In addition, particular tree-species may present "missing rings", and this influences the selection of trees for study of long time-spans. For instance, missing rings are rare in oak and [[elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;The only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".{{cite web | url = http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | title= Useful Tree Species for Tree-Ring Dating | author= Lori Martinez | year= 1996 | publisher= | location= | accessdate= 2008-11-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108094321/http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | archivedate= 2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical to the science, trees from the same region tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period of chronological study. Researchers can compare and match these patterns  ring-for-ring with patterns from trees which have grown at the same time in the same geographical zone (and therefore under similar climatic conditions). When one can match these tree-ring patterns across successive trees in the same locale, in overlapping fashion, chronologies can be built up—both for entire geographical regions and for sub-regions. Moreover, wood from ancient structures with known chronologies can be matched to the tree-ring data (a technique called ''cross-dating''), and the age of the wood can thereby be determined precisely. Dendrochronologists originally carried out cross-dating by visual inspection; more recently, they have harnessed computers to do the task, applying statistical techniques to assess the matching. To eliminate individual variations in tree-ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree-ring widths of multiple tree-samples to build up a '''ring history''', a process termed replication. A tree-ring history whose beginning- and end-dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching a section against another chronology (tree-ring history) whose dates are known.

[[File:Annual growth of the wood (second typical form of the growth function).jpg|thumb|A typical form of the function of the wood ring (in accordance with the dendrochronological equation)  with an increase in the width of wood ring at initial stage.]]

Dendrochronological equation defines the law of growth of tree rings.
The equation was proposed by Russian biophysicist Alexandr N. Tetearing in his work "Theory of populations" &lt;ref name=Tetearing2012&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Alexandr N. Tetearing
 |title=Theory of populations |year=2012 |page=583 |isbn=978-1-365-56080-4 |publisher=SSO Foundation |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{k_v\, \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} \, \frac{d\big(M^{\tfrac{1}{3}}(t)\big)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; is width of annual ring, &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time (in years), &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density of wood, &lt;math&gt; k_v &lt;/math&gt; is some coefficient, &lt;math&gt; M(t) &lt;/math&gt; is function of mass growth of the tree.

With the neglection of natural sinusoidal oscillations in tree mass,
the formula of the changes in the annual ring width is:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = -\dfrac{ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t} }{3 k_v \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}} (c_4+ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t})^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

There &lt;math&gt; c_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c_4 &lt;/math&gt; are some coefficients, &lt;math&gt; a_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2 &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

The formula is useful for correct approximation of samples data before data normalization procedure.

The typical forms of the function &lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) &lt;/math&gt; of annual growth of wood ring are  shown in the figures.

== Sampling and dating ==
Dendrochronology makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfrew Colin |author2=Bahn Paul |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=144–5 |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are often represented as estimated calendar years [[before present|B.P.]], for before present, where "present" refers to 1 January 1950.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

Timber core samples are sampled and used to measure the width of annual growth rings; by taking samples from different sites within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence. The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent). In addition, some genera of trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. For instance, the [[bristlecone pine]] is exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, and has been used extensively for chronologies; still-living and dead specimens of this species provide tree-ring patterns going back thousands of years, in some regions more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |title=Bibliography of Dendrochronology |publisher=ETH Forest Snow and Landscape Research |location=Switzerland |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804005355/http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}{{specify|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the maximum span for fully anchored chronology is a little over 11,000 years B.P.

In 2004 a new [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon calibration curve]], INTCAL04, was internationally ratified to provide calibrated dates back to 26,000 [[Before Present|B.P.]] For the period back to 12,400 B.P., the radiocarbon dates are calibrated against dendrochronological dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |title=INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon age calibration, 0–26 cal kyr BP |author1=Reimer Paula J |author2=Baillie Mike GL |author3=Bard Edouard |author4=Bayliss Alex |author5=Beck J Warren |author6=Bertrand Chanda JH |author7=Blackwell Paul G |author8=Buck Caitlin E |author9=Burr George S |author10=Cutler Kirsten B |author11=Damon Paul E |author12=Edwards R Lawrence |author13=Fairbanks Richard G |author14=Friedrich Michael |author15=Guilderson Thomas P |author16=Hogg Alan G |author17=Hughen Konrad |author18=Kromer Bernd |author19=McCormac Gerry |author20=Manning Sturt |author21=Ramsey Christopher Bronk |author22=Reimer Ron W |author23=Remmele Sabine |author24=Southon John R |author25=Stuiver Minze |author26=Talamo Sahra |author27=Taylor FW |author28=van der Plicht Johannes |author29=Weyhenmeyer Constanze E |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=1029–58 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630151251/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fairbanks |first=Richard |title=Current Research: Radiocarbon Calibration |url=http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |work=Columbia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825132650/http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendrochronology practice faces many obstacles, including the existence of [[species]] of [[ant]]s that inhabit [[tree]]s and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

== Reference sequences ==
European chronologies derived from wooden structures initially found it difficult to bridge the gap in the 14th century when there was a building hiatus, which coincided with the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=A Slice Through Time

 |page=124

 |isbn=978-0-7134-7654-5

 |location=London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there do exist unbroken chronologies dating back to prehistoric times, for example the Danish chronology dating back to 352 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |website=skalk.dk |title=WM Trædatering |language=da |trans-title=WM Tree dating |accessdate=15 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221121805/http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a sample of wood, the variation of the tree-ring growths provides not only a match by year, it can also match location because the climate across a continent is not consistent. This makes it possible to determine the source of ships as well as smaller artifacts made from wood but which were transported long distances, such as panels for paintings and ship timbers.

== Applications ==

=== Radiocarbon dating calibration ===
Dates from dendrochronology can be used as a [[calibration]] and check of [[radiocarbon dating]]&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

=== Climatology ===
{{Main|dendroclimatology}}

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s primarily from the properties of the annual tree rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/~sheppard/Raul/DendroclimatologyReview.pdf |title=Dendroclimatology: extracting climate from trees |first=Paul R. |last=Sheppard |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.]] |journal=WIREs Clim Change  |year=May-June 2010 |volume=1 |page=343-352 |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

=== Art history ===
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, determined to date from the 16th century by dendrochronology.]]

Dendrochronology has become important to art historians in the dating of [[panel painting]]s. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf English Heritage Guide to Dendrochronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063338/http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s have turned out to be painted on panels of "Baltic oak" shipped from the [[Vistula]] region via ports of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk, Ron, ''More than Meets the Eye: An Introduction to Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Paintings at the Fogg Art Museum'', Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 1, Autumn, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of seasoned wood were used, an uncertain number of years has to be allowed for seasoning when estimating dates.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ian Kuniholm, [http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf ''Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230735/http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }} Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; Panels were trimmed of the outer rings, and often each panel only uses a small part of the [[radius]] of the trunk. Consequently, dating studies usually result in a "[[terminus post quem]]" (earliest possible) date, and a tentative date for the actual arrival of a seasoned raw panel using assumptions as to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. Stanley |last1=Taft |first2=James W. |last2=Mayer |first3=Richard |last3=Newman |first4=Peter Ian |last4=Kuniholm |first5=Dusan |last5=Stulik |title=The Science of Paintings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98722-4 |chapter=Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings |chapterurl=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/painttex.html |pages=206–215 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422142755/https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |archivedate=2017-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of establishing numerous sequences, it was possible to date 85–90% of the 250 paintings from the 14th to 17th century analysed between 1971 and 1982;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, John, ''Panel Examination and Dendrochronology'' The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; by now a much greater number have been analysed.

A portrait of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] was believed to be an 18th-century copy. However, dendrochronology revealed that the wood dated from the second half of the 16th century. It is now regarded as an original 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots#dendro National Portrait gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017160354/http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dendrochronology was applied to four paintings depicting the same subject, that of [[Cleansing of the Temple|Christ expelling the money-lenders from the Temple]]. The results showed that the age of the wood was too late for any of them to have been painted by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 Tree Rings, the barcodes of Nature illuminate art history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043013/http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 |date=2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many panel paintings were transferred onto canvas or other supports during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Building history ===
The dating of buildings with wooden structures and components has also been done by using dendrochronology. While archaeologists can date wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure in which the wood was used; the wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood. The dating of building via dendrochronology thus requires knowledge of the history of building technology.&lt;ref name=sawyer1993&gt;{{cite book |title= Medieval Scandinavia: from conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500 |first1= Peter |last1= Sawyer |authorlink1= Peter Sawyer (historian) |first2= Birgit |last2= Sawyer |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |series= The Nordic Series |volume= 17 |year= 1993 |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-8166-1739-5 |oclc= 489584487 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518110748/https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate= 2015-05-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Similar seasonal patterns also occur in [[ice core]]s and in [[varve]]s (layers of [[sediment]] deposition in a lake, river, or sea bed). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake, and with the fineness of the sediment.

Some columnar [[cactus]] also exhibit similar seasonal patterns in the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in their spines ([[acanthochronology]]). These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the range of the seasonal data available to archaeologists and [[paleoclimatologist]]s.

A similar technique is used to [[Estimating the age of fish|estimate the age of fish]] stocks through the analysis of growth rings in the [[otolith]] bones.

The Fund for Peace works towards sustainable security and development in [[failed state]]s by focusing on conflict assessment and early warning, transnational threats, [[peacekeeping]], and security and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=435&amp;Itemid=598 "Mission"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund for Peace maintains programs in [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Liberia]], and works with private business in conflict zones to better secure the interests of businesses, local populations, and their governments.

FFP publishes the annual [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]], used by researchers, educators, and governments across the world.

==History==
The Fund for Peace was founded in 1957 by Randolph Compton. The organization was created in the memory of Randolph Compton's youngest son, John Parker Compton, who was killed in [[World War II]]. At a young age, John Parker wrote an essay, discussing the effects of war and the need for human civilization to embrace other methods of conflict resolution. After John Parker's death, Compton created the Fund for Peace, an organization based on the ideals of justice, environment, peace, and population.&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=96 "History"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant programs==

===The Fragile States Index===
The [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]] assesses the pressures experienced by nations based on social, economic, and political indicators such as demographic pressures, refugee flows, uneven economic development or severe economic decline, and human rights, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fundforpeace/docs/cr-10-97-ca-conflictassessmentindicators-1105c/2 |title=Conflict Assessment Indicators Pocket Guide |publisher=Issuu.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Failed States Index" debuted in 2005 with a limited assessment of approximately 75 countries; this was expanded to 146 countries in 2006, and then to 177 countries the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/faq-01-how-many-countries-in-fsi|title=How Many Countries are Included in the Fragile States Index?|website=fsi.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan was added to the assessment in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/fsi12-southsudan|title=An Inauspicious Welcome to South Sudan|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, The Fund for Peace announced that the ranking would be renamed "''Fragile'' States Index", claiming that the controversial term 'failed' had "[become] a distraction away from the point of the Index, which is to encourage discussions that support an increase in human security and improved livelihoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/blog-20140528-fsirenamed|title=Renaming the Failed States Index|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index uses color-coded maps, tables, and a four level-ranking system ("Alert," "Warning," "Moderate," "Sustainable") to determine the current conditions and negative potential in the future. All four nations on high "Alert" are a part of the African continent: [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the "Warning" level were many Latin American or former Soviet nations, including [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]]. At "Moderate" were the [[United States]] and several European states, such as [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]]. Only a few nations, such as the Scandinavian countries, [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were rated as "Sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=fsi-grid2011 |title=The Failed States Index 2011 Interactive Grid |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index is subject to criticism, in part, because it takes institutions and data to draw its conclusions, as opposed to the Human Development Index or other more telling signs. The FSI is checked against human analysis.

===UNLocK===
UNLocK  links global information technologies with local social networks for the benefits of stakeholders.  FFP conducts workshops in the conflict-affected countries of [[Liberia]], [[Uganda]], and [[Nigeria]], training local participants in the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST).  They train others at the community level.  Data collected from field reports by the participants are analyzed for signs of early-warning conflict.  The aggregate data is privately disseminated back to the participants and used to resolve disputes, identify priority issues at the community level, and as a way to obtain more immediate early warning and conflict prevention information.

While the recent elections in [[Nigeria]] were widely recognized as a major step forward in the difficult journey toward democracy, UNLocK Nigeria provided a ground-level view of challenges that remained, including incidents of ballot box snatching, vote-buying, abductions, and violence.  This report focuses on the [[Niger Delta|Niger Delta Region]], with a particular emphasis on the [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom]] and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/library/cr-11-18-ul-unlocknigeria-1106a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTC performs ground research in the [[Black Sea]]/[[South Caucasus|South Caucasus region]], the [[Triple Frontier|Tri-border area of Latin American]], [[East Africa|East]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Southeast Asia]].  It partners with regional and sub regional organizations like [[NATO]], the [[European Union|EU]], and [[african union|the African Union]].

The Center for the Study of Threat Convergence is funded by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[Ploughshares Fund]].

===Business and FFP===
Created in 1997, the '''Human Rights and Business Roundtable''' brings together businesses and human rights organizations to ensure compliance with international standards, particularly in regard to the conduct of security forces in and around industrial operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=program-hrbrt |title=Human Rights and Business Roundtable |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the challenges faced, particularly in the extractive industries, in balancing human rights and security.  FFP works with various private companies in the oil, mining, agribusiness, renewable energy, and infrastructure sectors in both stable and conflict zones around the world. The '''Sustainable Development &amp; Security''' program supports companies in their development of human rights and security policies, conflict and human rights assessments, community relations and stakeholder engagement, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sds.fundforpeace.org/sds|title=Sustainable Development &amp; Security {{!}} The Fund for Peace|website=sds.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFP is a long-standing civil society participant of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles on Security &amp; Human Rights]] initiative, and currently serves on the initiative's Steering Committee and Board of Directors.

===CAST===
For [[Conflict analysis|conflict assessment]], the Fund for Peace utilizes the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST). CAST was created in 1996 as a system of locating and analyzing potential conflicts in [[failed states]]. It works by incorporating "theoretical rationale, a conceptual framework, quantitative and qualitative indicators...and a rating system for trend analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/cast/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Conflict Assessment System Tool - About CAST |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "  However, CAST may be criticized for putting too much emphasis on technology and equations, and not enough on the human analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jennifer [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=241795 "From Nation State to Failed State"], Columbia Human Rights Law Review, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CAST is a tool that remains static, despite the specific conflict at hand. Each case is unique, and CAST does not have the mathematical ability to assess the uniqueness and specific needs of varying failed states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=145], The Fund for Peace, CAST.&lt;/ref&gt;

FFP maintains relationships with the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[South Korea]]n government, among others.

==Past programs==

===Genocide prevention===
As the Fund for Peace works in regions prone to genocide, the organization developed a relationship with the [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml "Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Mission Statement"] UN Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Adviser played a role in researching and delivering information to aid the Special Adviser in his responsibilities. The Special Adviser and the Fund for Peace were involved in researching human rights violations, sharing information and giving warnings to the Secretary General and the Security Council on matters of genocide, and making recommendations on courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=444&amp;Itemid=892], The Fund for Peace, Genocide Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace and Stability Operations Project===
Originally called the Regional Responses to Internal War Project, the program looks to shed light on regional organizations and their "political will" to maintain peaceful relations. The Peace and Stability Operations Project also serves to form relationships with actors in other sectors, such as scholars, research institutions, journalists, and experts. The Fund for Peace believes that, through these extended relationships, the international community can work together to maintain peace in typically violent areas. The Fund for Peace has been successful in advancing the international dialogue on peacekeeping by holding public meetings with international representatives, performing research missions in over thirty-five countries, and holding workshops. By collaborating with actors in other sectors, the Fund for Peace is able to gather the ideas and opinions of other experts and publish them in their issues of [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=125&amp;Itemid=173 Reality Check: Diverse Voices on Internal Conflict].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=208&amp;Itemid=257], The Fund for Peace, Peace and Stability Operations Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States foreign policy===
The second initiative is the Use and Purpose of American Power. The goal of this initiative is to promote ongoing dialogue and debate on the role of the United States in the international arena. It does so by asking four questions:
* What are our interests and values as we act in the world?
* What are the specific goals we should set and the things we should do?
* What tools do we use to achieve these?
* How as Americans do we influence events as they so obviously affect us?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=566], the Fund for Peace, Use and Purpose of American Power.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Use and Purpose of American Power also has three main components. The first is the National Dialogue forums. In 2008 and 2009, the Fund for Peace partnered up with local organizations, such as chambers of commerce and universities, across the country and organized "'traveling town halls.'" The purpose of these were to discuss topics relating to the presidential election, and the condition of the United States and its population. The format of the forums were designed to encourage participation and dialogue on behalf of Americans to actively and critically think about their role, their country's condition, and the government's responsibility. Throughout two years, the National Dialogue forums took place in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico, Alabama, Idaho, Florida, and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=328&amp;Itemid=563], The Fund for Peace, National Dialogue Forums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second component is the American Conversation. While the National Dialogue forums were designed to spark interest and discussion, the purpose of the American Conversation is an online discussion hosted by [https://groups.google.com/group/american-conversation?hl=en Google Groups] to continue conversations that began at the National Dialogue forums. The American Conversation is an effort by the Fund for Peace to encourage ongoing critical thinking in the minds of Americans and their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=331&amp;Itemid=879], The Fund for Peace, American Conversation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third component of the Use and Purpose of American Power is the Final Report. The Final Report is a summary of the National Dialogue forums and the ideas and concepts presented at the forums. The Final Report, titled [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/use_and_purpose_of_american_power_final_report.pdf The Use and Purpose of American Power in the 21st Century] highlights five main points:
* "Economic security is vital to American national security; but America’s structural economic problems prevent it from operating from a position of strength in the world."
* "National leaders should first ‘take care of their own’ because of the gravity of the economic challenges; however, America’s welfare is also closely tied to the world economy."
* "Nation-building and democracy-building projects are a mission impossible; still, the U.S. should promote good governance, human rights, and equitable development."
* "Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are lesser threats than America’s economic problems."
* "U.S. leaders’ inability to adapt to new global realities poses the greatest challenge to America’s standing in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace's efforts in United States foreign policy is based on the fear of "spillover" and the influence and multiplication of failed states.&lt;ref&gt;Mallaby, Sebastian [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57800/sebastian-mallaby/the-reluctant-imperialist-terrorism-failed-states-and-the-case-f "The Reluctant Imperialist"], Foreign Affairs, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Dialogue forums were sponsored by the Fund for Peace. The Final Report was funded by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Funding.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
Another initiative to promote human rights is the Globalization and Human Rights Series. This consists of publications dedicated to discussing pertinent topics relating to human rights, the impact of failing states, and corruption. Four issues have been published since 2005 in an effort to continue to educate the industries and the public on the harmful effects of failing governments, and the need for the recognition of, and commitment to, human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=156], The Fund for Peace, Globalization and Human Rights Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Fund for Peace is a supporter of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights]], which guides businesses who voluntarily participate on how to align their security practices with human rights considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/ "Voluntary Principles"] The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles]] are important because of the potentially harmful impacts security practices can have when operating in a failed state or conflict zone, but also because the international community is putting increasing emphasis on the rights of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=601], The Fund for Peace, Civil Society and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other collaboration==
The Fund for Peace does not limit its partnerships to select sectors. The organization has collaborated with [[Georgetown University]]'s Center for Peace and Security Studies and the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]. Together, the three institutions developed a [http://www.press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/peace-operations thesis on the increased participation of regional organizations] and their member states in promoting peacekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=209&amp;Itemid=248], The Fund for Peace, ''Peace Operations: Trends, Progress, and Prospects''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace partnered with the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] in 2007. From September 4–6, thirty participants from varying Middle Eastern countries, as well as Australia, the United States, and Canada, met in Istanbul, Turkey. The participants came from academia, international organizations, the Arab League, the United Nations, governments, and human rights organizations. The representatives were faced with the task of determining what steps should be taken to efficiently protect civilians. The conference promoted a sense of international unity by asking the representatives to leave aside their political ideologies and keep the welfare of human beings as their priority. The conference ended with the unanimous support of [[International Humanitarian Law]] and the [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/the%20bosphorous%20consensus%20final%2011.07.07.pdf Bosphorous Consensus].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=252], The Fund for Peace, the Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace has also partnered with Logos Technologies, the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[PKSOI|United States Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute]], the [[Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization|U.S. State Department Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to create a metrics framework for peacekeeping. The project includes concepts from the book ''The Quest for Viable Peace'' with the theoretical approach of the Fund for Peace's CAST methodology. The organizations involved are interested in helping governments determine the outcome of Stabilization and Reconstruction Operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=253], The Fund for Peace, Metrics for Stability.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew out of the Statistical Laboratory set up by [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] in [[Presidency College, Kolkata]]. Established in 1931, this [[public university]] of India is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions focused on statistics, and its early reputation led it to being adopted as a model for the first US institute of Statistics set up at the [[Research Triangle]], [[North Carolina]] by [[Gertrude Mary Cox]].&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was deeply influenced by wisdom and guidance of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Brajendranath Seal]]. Under his leadership, the institute initiated and promoted the interaction of Statistics with natural and social sciences to advance the role of Statistics as a key technology by explicating the twin aspects{{spaced ndash}}its general applicability and its dependence on other disciplines for its own development. The institute is now considered as one of the foremost centres in the world for training and research in Computer science, Statistics, Quantitative Economics and related sciences.

ISI has its headquarters in [[Baranagar]], [[Kolkata, West Bengal]]. It has four subsidiary centres focused in academics at [[Delhi]], [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]] and [[Tezpur]], and a branch at [[Giridih]]. In addition, the Institute has a network of units of [[Statistical Process Control|Statistical Quality Control]] and [[Operations Research]] at [[Vadodara]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] engaged in guiding the industries, within and outside India, in developing the most up–to–date quality management systems and solving critical problems of quality, reliability and productivity.

Primary activities of ISI are research and training of Statistics, development of theoretical Statistics and its applications in various natural and social sciences. Originally affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]], the institute was declared an institute of national importance in 1959, through an act of Indian parliament, Indian Statistical Institute act, 1959. ISI functions under the [[Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (India)|Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation]] (MOSPI) of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name=mospi&gt;{{cite web

Key areas of expertise of ISI are  [[Computer science]], Statistics, [[Mathematics]], [[Mathematical economics]], [[Operations Research]] and [[Information Science]] and it is one of the few research oriented Indian schools offering courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

== History ==
ISI's origin can be traced back to the Statistical Laboratory in [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] set up by Mahalanobis, who worked in the Physics Department of the college in the 1920s. During 1913–15, he did his [[Tripos]] in Mathematics and Physics at [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=hist1013&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he came across ''[[Biometrika]]'', a journal of Statistics founded by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref name=hist1019&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1915, he taught Physics at Presidency College,&lt;ref name=hist1013/&gt; but his interest in Statistics grew under the guidance of [[polymath]] [[Brajendranath Seal]].&lt;ref name=hist1019/&gt; Many colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in Statistics and the group grew in the Statistical Laboratory. Considering the extensive application of Statistics in solving various problems in real life such as analyzing multivariate anthropometric data, applying sample surveys as a method of data collection, analyzing meteorological data, estimating crop yield etc., this group, particularly, Mahalanobis and his younger colleagues [[Subhendu Sekhar Bose|S. S. Bose]] and [[Harish Chandra Sinha|H. C. Sinha]] felt the necessity of forming a specialized institute to facilitate research and learning of Statistics.&lt;ref name=evoln22&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Rao|Sinha|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 1931, Mahalonobis held a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir [[R. N. Mukherji]].&lt;ref name=evoln22/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite book | first = C.

In 1931, Mahalanobis was the only person working at ISI, and he managed it with an annual expenditure of Rs.250. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues including S. S. Bose, [[Samarendra Kumar Mitra]] (Head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory and designer of India's first computer), [[J. M. Sengupta]], [[Raj Chandra Bose]], [[Samarendra Nath Roy]], [[K. R. Nair]], [[R. R. Bahadur]], [[Gopinath Kallianpur]], [[D. B. Lahiri]], and [[Anil Kumar Gain]]. [[Pitamber Pant]], who had received training in Statistics at the institute, went on to become a secretary to the first Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and was a great source of help and support to the institute.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The institute started a training section in 1938. In due course, many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the USA or for positions in public/private sector in India. By the 1940s, the ISI was internationally known and was taken as a model when the first institute of Statistics was set up in the United States by Gertrude Cox{{spaced ndash}}perhaps the only time an institute in a developing country was used as a model in a developed country.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt;

As asked by the Government of India, in 1950, ISI designed and planned a comprehensive socio–economic national sample survey covering rural India. The organisation named National Sample Survey (NSS) was founded in 1950 for conducting this survey.&lt;ref name=evoln1718&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Rao|Sinha|1999|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field work was performed by the Directorate of NSS,  functioning under the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], whereas the other tasks such as planning of the survey, training of field workers, review, data processing and tabulation were executed by ISI.&lt;ref name=evoln1718/&gt; In 1961, the Directorate of NSS started functioning under the [[Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (India)#Department of Statistics|Department of Statistics]] of Government of India, and later in 1971, the design and analysis wing of NSS was shifted from ISI to the Department of Statistics forming the [[National Sample Survey Organisation]] (NSSO).&lt;ref name=evoln1718/&gt;

[[J. B. S. Haldane]] joined the ISI as a research professor from August 1957, and stayed on until February 1961, when he had a falling out with ISI Director P.C. Mahalanobis over Haldane's going on a much-publicized hunger strike to protest the United States pressuring U.S. National Science Fair winners [[Gary Botting]] and Susan Brown from attending an ISI banquet to which many prominent Indian scientists had been invited.&lt;ref&gt;"Haldane on Fast: Insult by USIS Alleged," ''Times of India'', 19 January 1961; "Protest Fast by Haldane: USIS’s Anti-Indian Activities," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Situation was Misunderstood, Scholars Explain," ''Times of India'', 20 January 1961;  "USIS Explanation does not satisfy Haldane: Protest fast continues," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1960; "USIS Claim Rejected by Haldane: Protest Fast to Continue," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane Not Satisfied with USIS Apology: Fast to Continue," Free Press Journal, 18 January 1961; "Haldane Goes on Fast In Protest Against U.S. Attitude," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane to continue fast: USIS explanation unsatisfactory," ''Times of India'', 19 January 1961; "Local boy in hunger strike row," ''Toronto Star'', 20 January 1961; "Haldane, Still on Fast, Loses Weight: U.S.I.S.

Until 1959, ISI was associated with the [[University of Calcutta]]. By 'The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959' of the Parliament of India, amended in 1995, ISI was declared an institute of national importance,&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt; and was authorised to hold examinations and to grant degrees and diplomas in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Economics, and in any other subject related to Statistics as identified by the Institute from time to time.&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt; ISI is a [[public university]], as the same act also states that ISI would be funded by the Central Government of India.&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt;

ISI had by the 1960s started establishing special service units in New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad to provide consultancy services to business, industry and governmental public service organisations in the areas of Statistical Process Control, Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. Additionally, Bangalore had a [[Documentation Research and Training Centre]] (DRTC). In the early 1970s, the Delhi and Bangalore units were converted to teaching centres. In 2008, ISI Chennai was upgraded to a teaching centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Traditionally, ISI offers fewer programs (and admits fewer students) than most other degree granting academic institutions. Following the empowerment for granting degrees in the subject of Statistics as per the ISI Act 1959, in 1960, ISI initiated bachelor level degree program Bachelor of Statistics and master level degree course Master of Statistics, and also began awarding research level degrees such as PhD and DSc.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; Later, ISI started offering Master of Technology (MTech) courses in Computer Science and in Quality, Reliability &amp; Operations Research (QR&amp;OR); these courses got recognition from [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE).&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; As ISI Act of 1959 was amended by the Parliament of India in 1995, ISI was empowered to confer degrees and diplomas in subjects such as Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science, and other subjects related to Statistics and Operations Research as determined by ISI from time to time.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; Apart from the degree courses, ISI offers few diploma and certificate courses, special diploma courses for international students via ISEC, and special courses in collaboration with [[Central Statistical Organisation|CSO]] for training probationary officers of [[Indian Statistical Service]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=isiprospectus&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~deanweb/GENPRSP2K12.pdf | format = PDF | title = Prospectus, 2012–13 | publisher = Indian Statistical Institute | accessdate = 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degree courses ===
ISI offers two undergraduate programs, viz. Bachelor of Statistics (Honours) (B.Stat) and Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours) (B. Math),&lt;ref name=prog&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/academicprogramme.php |title = Academic Programme |publisher = Indian Statistical Institute |accessdate = 2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven graduate programs, viz. Master of Statistics (M. Stat), Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (MSQE), Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLIS), Master of Science in Quality Management Science (MSQMS), Master of Technology in Computer Science (MTech–CS) and Master of Technology in Quality, Reliability and Operations Research (MTech–QROR),&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; three PG Diploma programs, viz Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA)&lt;ref name=pgdca&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~placement/assets/docs/PGDCASyllabus.pdf |title = PGDCA Programme |publisher = Indian Statistical Institute |accessdate = 2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and P.G. Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics and  research fellowships towards obtaining a PhD degree.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; The third PG diploma program being in collaboration with [[IIM Calcutta]] and [[IIT Kharagpur]] -  Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA)&lt;ref name=pgdba&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an aim to nurture and develop highly skilled business analytical professionals.

Undergraduate courses are of 3 years duration, whereas the graduate level courses of 2 years of duration. For all undergraduate and graduate level courses, the academic year is divided in two semesters.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Except for sponsored candidates of MTech courses, ISI students are not required to pay any tuition fees.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Conditional to performance beyond a threshold, all students and research fellows receive stipends, fellowships and contingency/book grants.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Students demonstrating outstanding performances are rewarded at the end of the semesters.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; ISI campuses provide hostel accommodations with recreational facilities and limited medical facilities available free of cost.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt;

=== Admissions ===
Applicants of all degree courses are required to go through written admission tests and interviews.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; ISI conducts the written tests at various examination centres across India.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Only in few cases, candidates may get called for the interview directly, viz. applicants of MTech Computer Science course having a [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]] score above a threshold.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Also, candidates of research fellowship programmes having already qualified for a fellowship from [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] or [[National Board for Higher Mathematics|NBHM]], can directly appear in an interview.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt;

=== International Statistical Education Centre ===
In 1950, ISI, in collaboration with [[International Statistical Institute]], [[UNESCO]] and Government of India, had set up International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC) to impart knowledge of theoretical and applied statistics to participants from Middle East, East and South-East Asia, the Far East and Commonwealth countries of Africa.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; The main training course offered by ISEC is meant for international students, preferably graduates with proficiency in English and Mathematics.&lt;ref name=itec&gt;{{cite web

== Achievements ==
Over the years, researchers of ISI made fundamental contributions in various fields of Statistics such as [[Design of Experiments]], Sample Survey, [[Multivariate statistics]] and [[Computer Science]]. Mahalanobis introduced the measure [[Mahalanobis distance]] which is used in multivariate statistics and other related fields.&lt;ref name=hist1023&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raj Chandra Bose]], who is known for his contributions in [[coding theory]], worked on Design of Experiments during his tenure at ISI, and was one of the three mathematicians, who disproved [[Leonard Euler|Euler]]'s conjecture on [[Graeco-Latin square|orthogonal Latin squares]].&lt;ref name=hist1020/&gt; [[Anil Kumar Bhattacharya]] is credited with introduction of the measures [[Bhattacharyya distance]] and [[Bhattacharyya distance#Bhattacharyya coefficient|Bhattacharya coefficient]]. Samarendra Nath Roy is known for his pioneering contributions in multivariate statistics.&lt;ref name=mardiasnroy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/statistics/research/reports/2007/STAT07-07.pdf | format = PDF | title = On S.N. Roy's Legacy to Multivariate Analysis | author = Kanti V. Mardia | publisher = Department of Statistics, [[University of Leeds]] | date = 23 January 2008 | accessdate = 10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among colleagues of Mahalanobis, other notable contributors were [[K. R. Nair]] in Design of experiments, [[J. M. Sengupta|Jitendra Mohan Sengupta]] in Sample Survey, Ajit Dasgupta in Demography and Ramkrishna Mukherjea in Quantitative Sociology.&lt;ref name=hist1020/&gt; C. R. Rao's contributions during his association with ISI include two theorems of [[Statistical Inference]] known as [[Cramér–Rao bound|Cramér–Rao inequality]] and [[Rao-Blackwell Theorem]], and introduction of [[orthogonal array]]s in Design of Experiments. [[Anil Kumar Gain]] is known for his contributions to the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] with his colleague Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=hist1023/&gt;

In 1953, India's first indigenous computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra who headed the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI Calcutta. The Indian Statistical Institute was also hosted the first two digital computers in South Asia; the HEC-2M from England in 1956, and the URAL from the Soviet Union in 1959. These were also among the earliest digital computers in Asia (outside Japan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menon|first=Nikhil|date=2018|title=‘Fancy Calculating Machine’: Computers and planning in independent India|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/fancy-calculating-machine-computers-and-planning-in-independent-india/AE97E3E18914EDF1378E29CAE1579BB2|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=52|pages=421–457|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1953 - 1956 distinguished scientists, like [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Yuri Linnik]] visited ISI. [[Norbert Wiener]] collaborated with [[Gopinath Kallianpur]] on topics including [[ergodic theory]], [[prediction theory]] and generalized [[harmonic analysis]].&lt;ref name="Norbert Wiener"&gt;{{cite web|title=Norbert Wiener and Probability Theory|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Jan1999/pdf/Jan1999p32-34.pdf|publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, during his month-long visit to ISI, Soviet mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] wrote his notable paper on [[Kolmogorov complexity]], which was published in Sankhya, 1963.&lt;ref name=hist103132&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|pp=1031–1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other distinguished scientists including [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Walter A. Shewhart]], [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Abraham Wald]] have visited ISI during the tenure of [[P. C. Mahalanobis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarma|title=Statistics Made Simple Do It Yourself On Pc 2Nd Ed|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning Commission ===
The [[Five-Year plans of India#Second Five-Year Plan .(1956.–.1961)|second five-year plan of India]] was a brainchild of Mahalanobis. The plan followed the [[Mahalanobis model]], an [[economic development]] model developed by Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth . It used the prevalent state of art techniques of operations research and optimisation as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at ISI. This second five-year plan shifted the focus from agriculture to industrialisation, with an objective of attaining self-reliance by economy of India. Domestic production of industrial products was encouraged in this plan, particularly in the development of the [[public sector]].&lt;ref name=Das88&gt;{{cite book

=== Social sciences ===
R. L. Brahmachari, known for his work in many fields like agricultural sciences, zoology, botany, biometrics, did much of his work at ISI.

The institute has done some pioneering work and research in anthropology and palaeontology. A trove of dinosaur fossils was discovered by a team led by ISI researchers in the early 1960s. The scattered fossils were recovered and the partial skeleton was reconstructed at ISI's Baranagar campus. It turned out to be a unique species and was named the ''[[Barapasaurus tagorei (Dinosauria: Sauropoda)]]'', after Rabindranath Tagore and was mounted in the Geology Museum at the Kolkata Campus of the Institute.

The Linguistic Research Unit (LRU) of ISI was involved in the study of speech pathology. [[Đorđe Kostić]] of this laboratory was a distinguished scientist. He invented a unique hearing aid, called SAFA (Selective Auditory Frequency Amplifier) that simulates frequency-range according to the need of the particular hearing impaired person.&lt;ref name=kostic&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.serbian-corpus.edu.rs/ns/history/djk2/djko.htm | title = Đorđe Kostić | publisher = Institute for Experimental Phonetics and Speech Pathology, Belgrade | accessdate = 30 November 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140928220142/http://www.serbian-corpus.edu.rs/ns/history/djk2/djko.htm | archivedate = 28 September 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since mid-forties, ISI pioneered in research and application of [[Statistical process control|Statistical Quality Control]] (SQC) in India.&lt;ref name=evoln24&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Rao|Sinha|1999|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter A. Shewhart]], the statistician known as ''the father of SQC'', and other experts of this field visited ISI over the years.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; The first Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC &amp; OR) unit of ISI was set up in Mumbai in 1953, followed by Bangalore and Kolkata units in 1954.&lt;ref name=evoln24/&gt; In 1976, this unit was transformed into the SQC &amp; OR Division,&lt;ref name=hist1032&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; which now operates eight units, located at various industrial centres in India{{spaced ndash}}Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Coimbatore and Vadodara.&lt;ref name=isidivs&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isical.ac.in/departments.php | title = Division and Units | publisher = Indian Statistical Institute | accessdate = 26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These units partake in technical consultancy with public and private organisations, in addition with performing research and training activities.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt;

The branch at [[Giridih]] was set up in 1931 and it has two operational units, viz. the Sociological Research Unit and the Agricultural Research Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120630/jsp/jharkhand/story_15673895.jsp | title = ISI Giridih a sorry statistic&amp;nbsp;– Research roadblock in cradle | author = Vishvendu Jaipuriar | publisher = [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]] | date = 30 June 2012 | accessdate = 26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kolkata campus ===
[[File:Isical01.jpg|thumb|300 px|Main Building of Indian Statistical Institute, [[Kolkata]]]]
ISI Kolkata has a campus consisting of six addresses at 201 through 206 [[Barrackpore Trunk Road]], [[Baranagar]]. These include a house, which was an erstwhile office of the [[National Sample Survey Organisation]] (NSSO) of India.

ISI Kolkata campus is eco-friendly, as conceived by Mahalanobis. Hollow bricks that protect from heat and noise were used with minimum use of reinforced concrete, to avoid radiation. There was no use of bitumen-basalt combination at the roads inside ISI campuses. This helps in reduction of radiation and preservation of rain water to maintain equilibrium in ground-water level.

The Kolkata campus offers bachelors level degree course in Statistics (B. Stat), master's degree course in Statistics (M.Stat), Mathematics (M.Math), Computer Science (MTech), Quality Reliability and Operations Research (MTech) and Quantitative Economics (M.S.).&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; Major divisions and units are: Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU), Human Genetics Unit (HGU), Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit (PAMU), Geological Studies Unit (GSU), Advanced Computation and MicroElectronics Unit (ACMU), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit (CVPRU), Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU), Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit (ECSU), Applied Statistics Unit (ASU), Economic Research Unit (ERU), Linguistic Research Unit (LRU), Sociology Research Unit (SRU), Psychometry Research Unit (PRU) and Population Studies Unit (PSU).

The Kolkata campus houses the International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC), which opened in 1950. This Centre provides training in statistics to sponsored students mainly from the Middle East, South and South East Asia, the Far East and the Commonwealth Countries of Africa. The Centre also offers various short-term courses in statistics and related subjects.

The Center for Soft Computing Research: A National Facility, an associate institute of Indian Statistical Institute and established in Kolkata in 2005, is unique in the country. Apart from conducting basic research, it offers a 3-month course and promotes less endowed institutes by providing fellowships and research grants.

The Central Library of ISI is located at Kolkata with branches at the other facilities. The library has over 200,000 volumes of books and journals with a special emphasis on the field of statistics and related studies. The main branch also has a collection of official reports, reprints, maps, and microfilms. The library receives over a thousand new technical and scientific journals every year. The Library has databases on CD-ROM and is working on further digitization of the collection. The library has a separate collection of works on the topics of mathematics and statistics called the Eastern Regional Centre of [[National Board for Higher Mathematics|NBHM]] collection, funded by grants from the [[National Board for Higher Mathematics]].

The Bangalore Centre of ISI started with a Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC&amp;OR) unit in 1954.&lt;ref name=evoln24/&gt; The Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC) here became operational from 1962 with honorary professor [[S. R. Ranganathan]] as the head.&lt;ref name=docencyclo&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA697&amp;dq=indian+statistical+institute+ranganathan#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20statistical%20institute%20ranganathan&amp;f=false | page = 697 | last = Wedeworth | first = Robert | publisher = American Library Association | year = 1993 | title = World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services | edition = 3 | accessdate = 23 December 2012| isbn = 9780838906095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Mahalanobis planned of starting a full-fledged centre of ISI here around the mid-sixties. In 1966, the then [[Government of Karnataka]] granted ISI 30 acres of forest land full of [[eucalyptus]] trees, next to the upcoming campus of the [[Bangalore University]], located on the [[State Highway 17 (Karnataka)|Mysore Road]] on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=isibhome&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.isibang.ac.in
|title = Home page, Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre
|accessdate = 18 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after death of Prof. Mahalanobis in 1972, the project of establishing Bangalore centre got temporarily shelved. The project was again revived during 1976–78. Concrete proposals were made to the Government of India to get grants for the development of the land already in possession of ISI, along with the construction of an academic block with a library and offices.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

In the meantime, a building was rented on [[Church Street (Bangalore)|Church Street]], in Bangalore downtown, and various activities of the Bangalore Centre started in September 1978. The Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) and the Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) were established. The SQC&amp;OR Unit and the DRTC unit, which were functioning from other rented buildings at that time, joined this new Centre.

As construction of the administrative block at the new campus got completed, the various units moved to the new campus in May 1985. The sprawling green wooded Campus has Residential Facility for students, faculty and staff.

The Bangalore centre was formally declared as a centre of ISI in September 1996.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Systems Science and Informatics Unit (SSIU) was established in 2009&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Bangalore centre has by now became an institution well known for its academic activities in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, SQC and Operations Research, Library and Information Science, and Quantitative Economics.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Bangalore campus offers bachelor level course Bachelor of Mathematics (B. Math), master level courses Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science (M. S.) in Library and Information Science and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quality Management Science, and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4610">'''The "Simion Stoilow" Institute of [[Mathematics]] of the Romanian Academy''' is a [[research institute]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. 

== History ==

On December 29th, 1945, a group of twenty Romanian mathematicians from various institutions in Bucharest led by [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] held a meeting at the [[University of Bucharest]] to establish ''The Institute of Mathematical Sciences'' with the aim of "promoting scientific research in mathematical sciences, through communications, talks, publications, congresses, and other means proper to this aim". In January 1946 they registered the Institute as a [[legal person]], specifically an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], with the [[Ilfov County]] Court. On June 9th, 1948 the new [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist regime]] revamped the [[Romanian Academy]] to an institution modeled on the [[Russian_Academy_of_Sciences#The_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_USSR|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], increasing by 1966 the number of its member research centers and institutes from 7 to 56. Among the newly created institutes was ''The Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy'', established in 1949 on the basis of the previous NGO with the contribution of [[Simion Stoilow]], one of the twenty founding members in 1945. 

In 1974, [[Zoia Ceauşescu]], a graduate of the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Bucharest, and the daughter of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], the communist head of state, was hired by the institute. Her parents were not happy with her choice in studying Mathematics. Provoked by a verbal disagreement with [[Miron Nicolescu]], in April 1975, Ceauşescu issued a decree to close down the Institute. The ensued disruption of normal scientific life led to eventual departure from Romania of a number of leading mathematicians, including [[Ciprian Foias]] and [[Dan-Virgil Voiculescu]]. In 1978, with contribution from Zoia Ceauşescu some of the former members of the Institute were hired into a newly established Mathematical section of the National Institute Scientific and Technical Creation (''Institutul National pentru Creatie Stiintifica si Tehnica'', INCREST), previously known as the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerospace Research (''Institutul de Mecanica Fluidelor si Cercetari Aerospatiale'', IMFCA), currently a private company (''INAV S.A.''), owned by [[:ro:Serviciile Comerciale Române|Grupul S.C.R.]].

After the [[1989 Romanian Revolution]], the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy (abbreviated IMAR) was re-established on March 8th, 1990 by a decree of the post-Communist Romanian government. It was placed under the Romanian Academy, itself partially reorganized by a decree of the same government on January 5th, 1990.

==Current situation==

Currently, IMAR is the leading Romanian institution in Mathematics research, with about 100 full- and part-time researchers. In 2000-2004, the Institute was a Centre of Excellence in Research of the [[European Commission]]. Since 2008, IMAR has a ''Laboratoire Européen Associé'' collaboration with [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. The Institute publishes two scientific journals (''Mathematical Reports'' and ''Revue roumaine de Mathématiques pures et appliquées''), and organizes many specialized conferences and congresses. Some of its members are well-known mathematicians.

IMAR also hosts the Theta Foundation, a not-for-profit independent publisher of scientific mathematical literature, and SNS-B, an independent postgraduate-level teaching initiative to guide towards research the best Romanian students. 

The Institute is located on Calea Griviţei street in downtown Bucharest in the same building it had before 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3262">''This page is about the concept in [[mathematical logic]]. For the concept in [[sociology]], see [[Institutional logic]]''.

'''Institutional model theory''' generalizes a large portion of [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[model theory]] to an arbitrary [[logical system]].

== Overview ==
The notion of "logical system" here is formalized as an [[Institution (computer science)|institution]]. Institutions constitute a model-oriented meta-theory on logical systems similar to how the theory of [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s constitute a meta-theory for classical [[linear algebra]]. Another analogy can be made with [[universal algebra]] versus [[Group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s etc. By abstracting away from the realities of the actual conventional logics, it can be noticed that institution theory comes in fact closer to the realities of non-conventional logics.

Institutional model theory analyzes and generalizes classical model-theoretic notions and results, like

* Elementary diagrams
* [[Elementary embedding]]s
* [[Ultraproduct]]s, [[Los' theorem]]
* [[Saturated model]]s
* [[Axiomatizable class|axiomatizability]]
* [[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]], [[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] axiomatizability
* [[Craig interpolation]]
* [[Robinson's joint consistency theorem|Robinson consistency]]
* [[Evert Willem Beth|Beth]] definability
* [[Gödel]]'s [[completeness theorem]]

For each concept and theorem, the infrastructure and properties required are analyzed and formulated as conditions on institutions, thus providing a detailed insight on which properties of first-order logic they rely and how much they can be generalized to other logics.

The earpiece itself may also be referred to as an IFB. Sometimes IFB is accomplished by the director talking to off-camera personnel who visually cue the on-camera talent.

The IFB is a special [[intercom]] [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]] that consists of a [[mix-minus]] program feed sent to an [[earpiece]] worn by talent via a wire, telephone, or radio receiver (audio that is being "fed back" to talent) that can be interrupted and replaced by a [[television producer]]'s or director's intercom [[microphone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Jonathan|title=Satellite newsgathering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raTNwAU-MUkC&amp;pg=PA122|edition=2|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-51973-6|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[television]] [[news program]] for example, a producer can talk to the [[news anchor]]s, to tell them when they are live on the air and when to begin reading off the [[script (recorded media)|script]] on the [[teleprompter]] or [[cue card]]s. In [[live television]], some news anchors are seen listening to IFBs in order to report [[breaking news]] and announcements.

In [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG), the IFB can be sent through a [[telephone hybrid]], or some other [[return link]] in a [[broadcast auxiliary service]]. The physics and design of electronics cause [[propagation delay|time delay]]s in signals as they travel through wire, fiber optics, or space and when they are converted back and forth from physical sound, electronic signals, radio waves, and from analogue to digital. The latter process and other audio processing can introduce unacceptable delays or echos into the sound. To achieve the mix-minus program to the IFB, certain audio elements that originate remotely from the mix point will be eliminated from the mix that is sent back to the IFB at the remote site to avoid those undesirable effects.

Wired or wireless [[in-ear monitor]]s (IEMs) may be used to carry the IFB audio to the on-air talent.

'''Ivanovka''' ({{lang-ru|Ивановка}}) is an estate near [[Tambov]], [[Russia]], which used to be the summer residence of the Russian composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in the period between 1890 and 1917 (until his emigration). It was the family home of his aristocratic relatives, the Satins. Many of Rachmaninoff's earlier masterpieces [[List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff|were created]] in its bucolic atmosphere. A museum commemorating the life and works of the composer was opened there in 1982.

The estate of Rachmaninoff is actually located due east of the Russian town called Mozdek, and can be found at latitude 51°57'14.24"N and longitude 42° 0'7.85"E.1  This estate is now a museum dedicated to the beloved Russian composer, whose professional life was marked with dismissive criticism,2 although his music continues to fill concert halls around the world.  Although located in the Tambov Oblast, the house of his inheritance is some 12 miles due west from Uvaravo,3 and this was likely his community. A trip to Moscow would be some 300 miles and was likely taken by Train from Tambov.4

The '''Kyoto school''' (京都派 ''-ha'') was a collection of several styles and schools of [[Japanese painting]] of the late [[Edo period]]. Though there are many broad similarities between the styles within the school, these styles display key differences that separate them. Many were in fact reactions to one another, an artist or group of artists seeking to express themselves differently from those around them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideals of the East: The Spirit of Japanese Art|last=Okakura|first=Kakuzo|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-486-44024-8|location=Mineola, New York|pages=87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those subscribers of the Kyoto school found themselves at odds with the state sanctioned Kanō school, thus contributing to the vague nature of the former. 

[[Okakura Kakuzō|Kakuzo Okakura]], predominant Japanese art historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, traced the origins of the Kyoto school to the schools of both [[Qing dynasty|Manchu-shin]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties in China. The two latter schools focused on the power of the artist as a lay person or scholar, as opposed to a professional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Okakura is swift with a critique of the Kyoto school's attempts to repurpose the Japanese tradition of copying works from other (predominantly Chinese) cultures, a technique known as ''[[utsushi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kameda-Madar|first=Kazuko|date=2014-09-01|title=Copying and Theory in Edo-Period Japan (1615–1868)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.12111/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=708–727|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.12111|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more prominent schools under the Kyoto school umbrella was the [[Shijo school|Shijō school]], named after the street where many of the artists had their studios. ''Shijō'' (四条) literally translates to 'fourth avenue.' This school sought to produce a synthesis of the more realistic style of [[Maruyama Okyo|Maruyama Ōkyo]] with that of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' or Southern School styles. [[Mori Sosen]] was one of the more prominent painters in the Shijō school.

The ''nanga'' or Southern School, meanwhile, rebelled against the realism of Ōkyo and the Shijō artists, seeking to return to the inspiration and style of [[Chinese painting|China's]] [[Southern School]].

'''Landscape limnology''' is the spatially explicit study of [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s as they interact with freshwater, terrestrial, and human [[landscape]]s to determine the effects of pattern on [[ecosystem]] processes across temporal and spatial scales. [[Limnology]] is the study of inland water bodies inclusive of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; landscape limnology seeks to integrate all of these ecosystem types.

The [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] component represents spatial hierarchies of landscape features that influence which materials, whether solutes or organisms, are transported to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems; aquatic connections represent how these materials are transported; and human activities reflect features that influence how these materials are transported as well as their quantity and temporal dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.E. Webster, K.S. Cheruvelil and M.T. Bremigan. 2009. The lake landscape-context framework: linking aquatic connections, terrestrial features and human effects at multiple spatial scales. Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie. 30:695-700&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The core principles or themes of [[landscape ecology]] provide the foundation for landscape limnology. These ideas can be synthesized into a set of four landscape ecology themes that are broadly applicable to any aquatic ecosystem type, and that consider the unique features of such ecosystems. 

'''A landscape limnology framework begins with the premise of Thienemann (1925). Wiens (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 2002. Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water. Freshwater Biology 47:501-515&lt;/ref&gt; freshwater ecosystems can be considered patches.''' As such, the location of these patches and their placement relative to other elements of the landscape is important to the ecosystems and their processes. Therefore, the four main themes of landscape limnology are:

'''(1) Patch characteristics:''' The characteristics of a freshwater ecosystem include its physical morphometry, chemical, and biological features, as well as its boundaries. These boundaries are often more easily defined for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., shoreline, [[riparian zone]]s, and emergent vegetation zone) and are often a focal-point for important ecosystem processes linking terrestrial and aquatic components.

'''(2) Patch context:''' The freshwater ecosystem is embedded in a complex terrestrial mosaic (e.g., soils, geology, and land use/cover) that has been shown to drive many within-ecosystem features and processes such as water chemistry, species richness, and primary and secondary productivity. 

'''(3) Patch connectivity and directionality:''' The complex freshwater mosaic is connected to the particular patch of interest and defines the degree to which materials and organisms move across the landscape through freshwater connections. For freshwater ecosystems, these connections often display a strong directionality component that must be explicitly considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, G.W., G.W. Kipphut, M.M. Miller, and J. O’Briens. 2000. Integration of lakes and streams in a landscape perspective: the importance of material processing on spatial patterns and temporal coherence. Freshwater Biology 43: 477-497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcarelli, A.M. and W.A. Wurtsbaugh. 2007. Effects of upstream lakes and nutrient limitation on periphytic biomass and nitrogen fixation in Oligotrophic, subalpine streams. Freshwater Biology 52:2211-2225&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a specific wetland can be connected through groundwater to other wetlands or lakes, or through surface water connections directly to lakes and rivers, or both, and the directionality of those connections will strongly impact the movement of nutrients and biota.

'''(4) Spatial scale and hierarchy:''' Interactions among terrestrial and freshwater elements occur at multiple spatial scales that must be considered hierarchically. The explicit integration of hierarchy into landscape limnology is important because (a) many freshwater ecosystems are hierarchically organized and controlled by processes that are hierarchically organized,&lt;ref&gt;Frissell, C.A., W.J. Liss, C.E. Warren &amp; M.D. Hurley. 1986. A hierarchical framework for stream habitat classification: viewing streams in a watershed context. Environmental Management 10: 199–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"&gt;Tonn, W.M. 1990. Climate change and fish communities: A conceptual framework. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:337-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poff, N.L. 1997. Landscape filters and species traits: towards mechanistic understanding and prediction in stream ecology. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 16: 391–409&lt;/ref&gt; (b) most freshwater ecosystems are managed at multiple spatial scales, from policy set at the national level, to land management conducted at local scales, and (c) the degree of homogeneity among freshwater ecosystems can change in relation to the scale of observation.

==Contributions to other fields==

Findings from landscape limnology research are contributing to many facets of aquatic ecosystem research, management, and conservation.  Landscape limnology is especially relevant for geographical areas with thousands of ecosystems (i.e. lake-rich regions of the world), in situations with a range of human disturbances, or when considering lakes, streams, and wetlands that are connected to other such ecosystems. For example, landscape limnology perspectives have contributed to the development of nutrient criteria for lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.S. Cheruvelil, R.J. Stevenson, S.L. Rollins, S.W. Holden, S. Heaton, and E.K. Torng. 2008. A framework for developing ecosystem-specific nutrient criteria: Integrating biological thresholds with predictive modeling. Limnology and Oceanography 53(2): 773-787&lt;/ref&gt; formation of classification systems that can be used to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Cheruvelil, K.S., P.A. Soranno, M.T. Bremigan, T. Wagner, and S.L. Martin. 2008. Grouping lakes for water quality assessment and monitoring: the roles of regionalization and spatial scale.

'''Limbitless Solutions''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in the [[United States]] that uses additive manufacturing ([[3D printing]]) to advance affordable personalized bionics and [[prostheses|prosthetic]] partial arms for children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/about-us/ Our Limitless Mission] Our Limitless Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The organization claims their limbitless’ bionic arms are manufactured for under $400, 1% of traditional prostheses.&lt;ref name=" Huffington Post "&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSNyjnVQScA Huffington Post] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Orlando, Florida]],&lt;ref name=" Florida Department of State Division of Corporations"&gt;[http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090&amp;aggregateId=domnp-n14000009409-652f57c1-6b2b-4470-b04d-9753bc6a0e67&amp;searchTerm=limbitless%20solutions&amp;listNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090 Florida Department of State Division of Corporations] Florida Department of State Division of Corporations&lt;/ref&gt; the organization was founded by a team of [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, led by executive director Albert Manero.&lt;ref name="Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives"&gt;[http://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/kid-approved Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives] Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, the Limbitless Solutions team began the first project at the [[university]] campus manufacturing lab in 2014. The organization used a donated [[Stratasys]] Dimension 3D Printer and other supplies to create an affordable prosthetic, to minimize cost and time of traditional manufacturing processes like [[CNC milling]].&lt;ref name=" Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm "&gt;[http://blog.stratasys.com/2015/08/05/3d-printed-prosthetic-arm/ Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm] Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/health/ucf-3d-printed-arms-for-kids/ CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids] CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the student's free time, their first arm used a 3D printer running with off-the-shelf [[servos]] and batteries that were activated by the [[electromyography]] muscle energy on a child’s limb.&lt;ref name=" UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm "&gt;[http://today.ucf.edu/fulfilling-6-year-olds-dream-ucf-students-design-build-arm/ UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm] UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm&lt;/ref&gt; Most prosthetic arms are [[machine (mechanical)|mechanical]], which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their [[biceps]].&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "/&gt;

== Production ==

When producing a prosthesis, the child is measured (size of residual limb, length of limb, etc.) and the model of the arm is then appropriately scaled and adjusted before being printed, assembled, and fitted. [[Electromyography]] (EMG) sensors are calibrated before the arm is ready for use.&lt;ref name="What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421094737/http://www.limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ |date=2015-04-21 }} What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless&lt;/ref&gt;
The time to fabricate one bionic arm ranges depending on several factors, the most influential being the type of [[amputation]]. The time to build a helper hand is 4–6 weeks, and a bionic arm without an elbow is 8–12 weeks. In addition to partial arms, Limbitless has said it has plans to make full arms with elbows as well as legs.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research''' was founded in [[Müncheberg]], Germany in 1928 as part of the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft]]. The founding director, [[Erwin Baur]], initiated breeding programmes with fruits and berries, and basic research on ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'' and the domestication of [[lupin]]s. After the Second World War, the institute moved west to [[Voldagsen]], and was relocated to new buildings on the present site in [[Cologne]] in 1955. 

·The modern era of the Institute began in 1978 with the appointment of [[Jeff Schell]] and the development of plant transformation technologies and plant [[molecular genetics]]. The focus on molecular genetics was extended in 1980 with the appointment of Heinz Saedler. The appointment in 1983 of Klaus Hahlbrock broadened the expertise of the Institute in the area of plant biochemistry, and the arrival of Francesco Salamini in 1985 added a focus on crop genetics. During the period 1978-1990, the Institute was greatly expanded and new buildings were constructed for the departments led by Schell, Hahlbrock and Salamini, in addition to a new lecture hall and the [[Max Delbrück]] Laboratory building that housed independent research groups over a period of 10 years.

A new generation of directors was appointed from 2000 with the approaching retirements of Klaus Hahlbrock and Jeff Schell. [[Paul Schulze-Lefert]] and [[George Coupland]] were appointed in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and [[Maarten Koornneef]] arrived three years later upon the retirement of Francesco Salamini. The new scientific departments brought a strong focus on utilising model species to understand the regulatory principles and molecular mechanisms underlying selected traits. The longer-term aim is to translate these discoveries to breeding programmes through the development of rational breeding concepts. The arrival of a new generation of Directors also required modernisation of the infrastructure. So far, this has involved complete refurbishment of the building that houses the Plant Developmental Biology laboratory (2004), construction of a new guesthouse and library (2005), planning of new buildings for the administration and technical workshops (2009), and a new laboratory building completed in May 2012. The new laboratory building includes a section that links the three scientific departments, offices and the Bioinformatics Research Group.

{{Asof|May 2015}}, the institute had four scientific departments: Department of Plant Developmental Biology (George Coupland), Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics (Maarten Koornneef), Department of Plant Microbe Interactions (Paul Schulze-Lefert), and Department of Comparative Development and Genetics ([[Miltos Tsiantis]]), and a number of independent research groups.

== Graduate program ==
Beginning in 1999 the [[Max Planck Society]] initiated the implementation of International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) as a new way to cooperate with partner universities in Germany. The intention of this ambitious plan is twofold. On the one hand, the [[Max Planck Society]] tries to intensify the collaboration with university affiliated research groups and faculty at home. On the other hand, due to the great demand of junior scientists, one was trying to attract qualified students from Germany and abroad to help train a new generation of scientists. It seemed reasonable to combine scientific leadership and technical expertise on a local scale by jointly offering this new way to train promising scientists from around the world. The Ph.D. program provides a true interdisciplinary approach for highly motivated students to receive a Ph.D. degree and to participate in cutting edge research. Major changes and adjustments were necessary to put this idea into reality. First, because of the international character, teaching and practical training had to be offered in English to make the program attractive for foreign students. Second, the training should target a very specific area of research for which the existing faculty is internationally known. Third, the research schools are intended to represent centres of excellence. The IMPRS at the Max Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Research together with the [[University of Cologne]] represent such a centre of excellence in the area of molecular plant science, and was formed in 2001. Currently,{{when|date=October 2014}} this IMPRS has about 40 Ph.D. students, where half come from countries outside of Germany. Admission is entirely linked to scientific merit and achievement.

The '''National Cryptologic School''' ('''NCS''') is a school within the [[National Security Agency]] that provides  training to members of the Agency.

The National Cryptologic School is a Cryptologic Training School within the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It is responsible for designing, developing, and delivering curriculum in [[Cryptology]], [[Information Assurance]], Language, and Leadership.

It was opened on November 1, 1965, and is now housed on multiple campuses, including the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] facility in [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |authorlink=James Bamford |title=The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1983 |page=153 |isbn=9780140067484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Career Development |publisher=National Security Agency |date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.nsa.gov/careers/career_dev/ |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCS courses are provided to the civilian and military population of the NSA, as well as the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]], the military services, and the [[Central Security Service]] (CSS). Many of the courses are accredited by the [[American Council on Education]] and the [[Council on Occupational Education]], and are eligible for transfer credits at a variety of educational institutions.

Training is delivered via computer-based methods, as well as in the traditional classroom setting. Employees have access to thousands of web-based training courses developed by NSA, as well as those offered by a variety of vendors and agencies throughout the Intelligence Community.

'''Nuclear atypia''' refers to abnormal appearance of [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. It is a term used in [[cytopathology]] and [[histopathology]]. Atypical nuclei are often [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]].

Nuclear atypia can be seen in reactive changes, [[Precancerous condition|pre-neoplastic changes]] and [[malignancy]].  Severe nuclear atypia is, in most cases, considered an indicator of [[malignancy]].

The main computer network simulation models are available in several external frameworks. The most commonly used one is INET &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inet.omnetpp.org/|title=INET Framework|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/inet-framework/inet|title=INET framework for the OMNeT++ discrete event simulator|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a variety of models for all kind of network protocols and technologies like for [[IPv6]], [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] etc. INET also offers a set of [[mobility model]]s to simulate the node movement in simulations. The INET models are licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] or [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/master/License|title=INET License|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4075">The '''pheromone biosynthesis activation neuropeptide''' ('''PBAN''') is a [[neurohormone]] (member of the PBAN/pyrokinin [[neuropeptide]] family) that activates the biosynthesis of [[pheromone]]s in moths. Moth females release PBAN into their hemolymph during the [[wikt:scotophase|scotophase]] to stimulate the biosynthesis of the unique pheromone that will attract the conspecific males. PBAN release is drastically reduced after mating, contributing to the loss in female receptivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=Ada |title=Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN): Regulatory role and mode of action |journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |year=2009 |pmid=18495120 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2008.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Agrotis ipsilon]]'' (black cutworm), it has been shown that the [[Juvenile hormone|Juvenile Hormone]] helps induce release of PBAN which goes on to influence pheromone production and responsiveness in females and males, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Duportets, Line, et al. “The Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN) of the Black Cutworm Moth, Agrotis Ipsilon: Immunohistochemistry, Molecular Characterization and Bioassay of Its Peptide Sequence.”&amp;nbsp;''Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'', vol. 28, no. 8, 1998, pp. 591–599., doi:10.1016/s0965-1748(98)00033-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Helicoverpa assulta]], the circadian rhythm of pheromone production is closely associated with PBAN release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeon Choi|first=Man|last2=Tanaka|first2=Minoru|last3=Kataoka|first3=Hiroshi|last4=Saeng Boo|first4=Kyung|last5=Tatsuki|first5=Sadahiro|date=1998-10-01|title=Isolation and identification of the cDNA encoding the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide and additional neuropeptides in the oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)1The cDNA sequence of this paper has been deposited in the GenBank data base (Accession No. U96761).1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965174898000654|journal=Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=759–766|doi=10.1016/S0965-1748(98)00065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular mechanism of action==
The precise regulatory mechanisms exerted by PBAN on the different steps of pheromone biosynthesis remain to be determined.

According to the effects of gene disruption in the pheromone synthesis of [[Bombykol]] (the main pheromone component of the [[Bombyx mori|silk moth ''Bombyx mori'']] and the [[Helicoverpa zea|corn earworm moth]]), the increase in intracellular calcium levels turns to activate different key enzymes of the last steps of pheromone biosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohnishi |first1=Atsushi |last2=Hull |first2=J.

'''RIAA equalization''' is a specification for the recording and playback of [[gramophone records|phonograph record]]s, established by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The purposes of the [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] are to permit greater recording times (by decreasing the mean width of each groove), to improve sound quality, and to reduce the groove damage that would otherwise arise during playback.

The [[RIAA]] equalization curve was intended to operate as a [[de facto]] global [[Technical standard|industry standard]] for records since 1954.  However, it is almost impossible to say when the change actually took place.&lt;ref name="Copeland"&gt;{{Cite book

Before then, especially from 1940, each record company applied its own equalization; there were over 100 combinations of turnover and [[rolloff]] frequencies in use, the main ones being Columbia-78, Decca-U.S., European (various), Victor-78 (various), Associated, BBC, NAB, Orthacoustic, World, Columbia LP, FFRR-78 and microgroove, and AES. The obvious consequence was that different reproduction results were obtained if the recording and playback filtering were not matched.

==The RIAA curve==
RIAA equalization is a form of [[pre-emphasis]] on recording and [[de-emphasis]] on playback. A recording is made with the low [[frequency|frequencies]] reduced and the high frequencies boosted, and on playback the opposite occurs. The net result is a flat frequency response, but with [[attenuation]] of high frequency noise such as hiss and clicks that arise from the recording medium. Reducing the low frequencies also limits the excursions the cutter needs to make when cutting a groove. Groove width is thus reduced, allowing more grooves to fit into a given surface area, permitting longer recording times. This also reduces physical stresses on the [[stylus]] which might otherwise cause [[distortion]] or groove damage during playback.

A potential drawback of the system is that [[Rumble measurement|rumble]] from the playback [[phonograph|turntable]]'s drive mechanism is amplified by the low frequency boost that occurs on playback. Players must therefore be designed to limit rumble, more so than if RIAA equalization did not occur.

RIAA playback equalization is not a simple low-pass filter. It defines transition points in three places: 75&amp;nbsp;µs, 318&amp;nbsp;µs and 3180&amp;nbsp;µs, which correspond to 2122&amp;nbsp;Hz, 500&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (rounded values).&lt;ref name="stereophile2009"&gt;'Cut and Thrust: RIAA LP Equalization' by Keith Howard, Stereophile, Vol. 32, No. 3, March 2009, pp. 53–62 http://www.stereophile.com/features/cut_and_thrust_riaa_lp_equalization/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
Mathematically, the pre-emphasis [[transfer function]] is expressed as follows, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=318&amp;nbsp;µs, etc.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereophile.com/content/cut-and-thrust-riaa-lp-equalization-neumann-4th-pole-sic|title=Cut and Thrust: RIAA LP Equalization The Neumann 4th pole (sic)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;f(s)=\frac{(sT_1+1)(sT_3+1)}{(sT_2+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Implementing this characteristic is not especially difficult, but is more involved than a simple amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;'On RIAA Equalization Networks' by Stanley P. Lipshitz, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, Vol. 27, No. 6, June 1979, pp. 458–481.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, almost all hi-fi preamplifiers, integrated amplifiers, and receivers had a  built-in phono preamplifier with the RIAA characteristic, but it is often omitted in modern designs, due to the gradual obsolescence of vinyl records. Add-on phono preamplifiers with the RIAA equalization curve are available; these adapt a [[magnetic cartridge|magnetic phono cartridge]] to an unbalanced −10&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dBv]] consumer [[line-level]] RCA input. Some modern turntables feature built-in preamplification to the RIAA standard. Special preamplifiers are also available for the various equalization curves used on pre-1954 records.

[[Digital audio editor]]s often feature the ability to equalize audio samples using standard and custom equalization curves, removing the need for a dedicated hardware preamplifier when capturing audio with a computer. However, this can add an extra step in processing a sample, and may amplify audio quality deficiencies of the [[sound card]] being used to capture the signal.

==History==

===Origins of pre-emphasis===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
Equalization practice for electrical recordings dates to the beginning of the art. In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] disclosed that the recording pattern of the [[Western Electric]] "rubber line" magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased.  Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place, with the cutter  into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.

West in 1930 and later P. G. H. Voight (1940) showed that the early Wente-style [[condenser microphone]]s contributed to a 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;dB midrange brilliance or pre-emphasis in the recording chain.  This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as [[Columbia Records]] and [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] had a higher amplitude in the midrange region.  Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response.  As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using [[pre-emphasis]] above 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz in 78 and 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm records, some 29 years before the RIAA curve.

Over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard. For example, in Europe, for many years recordings required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250 to 300&amp;nbsp;Hz and a treble [[rolloff]] at 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz ranging from 0 to −5&amp;nbsp;dB, or more.  In the United States there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies, such as 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, as well as a greater treble rolloff like −8.5&amp;nbsp;dB, and more. The purpose was to record higher modulation levels on the record.

===Standardization===
Evidence from the early technical literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it was not until the 1942–1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry. Before this time, electrical recording technology from company to company was considered a proprietary art all the way back to the 1925 Western Electric licensed method first used by Columbia and Victor. For example, what Brunswick-Balke-Collender ([[Brunswick Corporation]]) did was different from the practices of Victor.

Broadcasters were faced with having to adapt daily to the varied recording characteristics of many sources: various makers of "home recordings" readily available to the public, European recordings, lateral cut transcriptions, and vertical cut transcriptions. Efforts were started in 1942 to standardize within the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), later known as the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB). The NAB, among other items, issued recording standards in 1949 for laterally and vertically cut records, principally transcriptions. A number of 78 rpm record producers as well as early LP makers also cut their records to the NAB/NARTB lateral standard.

The lateral cut NAB curve was remarkably similar to the NBC Orthacoustic curve which evolved from practices within the National Broadcasting Company since the mid-1930s. Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100&amp;nbsp;Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16&amp;nbsp;dB at 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could be heard despite the high background noise of [[shellac]] discs. When the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve ([[de-emphasis]]), signal to noise ratio was improved and the programming sounded more lifelike.

In a related area, around 1940 treble pre-emphasis similar to that used in the NBC Orthacoustic recording curve was first employed by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in his system of Frequency Modulation ([[FM broadcasting|FM]]) radio broadcasting. FM radio receivers using Armstrong circuits and treble de-emphasis would render high quality wide-range audio output with low noise levels.

When the Columbia LP was released in June 1948, the developers subsequently published technical information about the 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm, microgroove, long playing record. Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing that it was like the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or pre-emphasis below 150&amp;nbsp;Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. Nevertheless, the curve was not yet based on mathematical formulae, at least not explicitly.

In 1951, at the beginning of the post-World War II high fidelity (hi-fi) popularity, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) developed a standard playback curve.&lt;ref&gt;'AES Standard Playback Curve', Audio Engineering, Vol. 35, No. 1, January 1951, pp. 22 and 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended for use by hi-fi amplifier manufacturers. If records were engineered to sound good on hi-fi amplifiers using the AES curve, this would be a worthy goal towards standardization. This curve was defined by the transition frequencies of audio filters and had a pole at 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz (approximately 63.7&amp;nbsp;µs) and a zero at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz (approximately 397.9&amp;nbsp;µs).

RCA Victor and Columbia were in a "market war" concerning which recorded format was going to win: the Columbia LP versus the RCA Victor 45 rpm disc (released in February 1949). Besides also being a battle of disc size and record speed, there was a technical difference in the recording characteristics. RCA Victor was using "New Orthophonic" whereas Columbia was using the LP curve.

Ultimately the New Orthophonic curve was disclosed in a publication by R. C. Moyer of RCA Victor in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;'Evolution of a Recording Curve' by R. C. Moyer, Audio Engineering, Vol. 37, No. 7,  July 1953, pp. 19–22 and 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; He traced RCA Victor characteristics back to the Western Electric "rubber line" recorder in 1925 up to the early 1950s laying claim to long-held recording practices and reasons for major changes in the intervening years. The RCA Victor New Orthophonic curve was within the tolerances for the NAB/NARTB, Columbia LP, and AES curves. It eventually became the technical predecessor to the RIAA curve.

Between 1953 and 1956 (before the stereo LP in 1958) several standards bodies around the world  adopted the same playback curve—identical to the RCA Victor New Orthophonic curve—which became standard throughout the national and international record markets.&lt;ref&gt;'Disc Playback Characteristics', Wireless World, April 1956, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although these standards were all identical, no universal name was used. One of the standard was called simply "RIAA", and it is likely that this name was eventually adopted because it was memorable.

It is possible that some niche record cutters were still using EQ curves other than the RIAA well into the 1970s.  As a result, some audio manufacturers today produce Phono Equalizers with selectable EQ curves, including options for Columbia, Decca, CCIR, and TELDEC's [[Direct Metal Mastering]].

==The Enhanced RIAA curve==
The official RIAA standard defines three time-constants with pre-emphasis rising indefinitely above 75&amp;nbsp;µs, but in practice this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and cutting lathe imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the pre-emphasis characteristic, so no official upper limit was included in the RIAA definition.

Modern systems have far wider potential bandwidth. An essential feature of all cutting lathes—including the Neumann cutting lathes—is a forcibly imposed high frequency roll-off above the audio band (&gt;20&amp;nbsp;kHz). This implies two or more additional time constants to those defined by the RIAA curve. This is not standardized anywhere, but set by the maker of the cutting lathe and associated electronics.

The so-called "Enhanced RIAA" curve or "eRIAA" curve attempts to provide complementary correction for these unofficial time constants upon playback.

===Background===

In 1995 one non-academic source erroneously suggested that Neumann cutting lathes applied a single high-frequency pole at 3.18&amp;nbsp;µs (50&amp;nbsp;kHz)&lt;ref&gt;"The Tube Preamp Cookbook" A. Wright, Vacuum State Electronics, 1995 http://tubeamps.webs.com/1997_The_Tube_Preamp_Cookbook_Allen_Wright.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and that a complementary zero should therefore be included upon playback. However, no such pole exists.&lt;ref name="Self"&gt;"Small Signal Audio Design" D. Self, Elsevier, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the RIAA pre-emphasis in the popular Neumann SAB 74B equaliser reaches a maximum at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, and in addition to this, the circuit also applies a second-order roll off at 49.9&amp;nbsp;kHz, implemented by a Butterworth (maximally flat) active filter, plus an additional pole at 482&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="stereophile2009"/&gt; This cannot be compensated for by a simple zero even if it were necessary, and in any case, other lathes will differ. Correction upon playback is not, in fact, required, as it is taken into account at the cutting stage when manual equalisation is applied while monitoring initial cuts on a standard RIAA playback system. Nevertheless, the use of the erroneous zero remains a subject of some debate among amateur enthusiasts.

It is worth noting that many common phono preamplifier designs using negative feedback equalisation include an unintentional zero at high frequencies, similar to that proposed by Wright. This was illustrated, for example, in the seminal 1980 work on RIAA Playback Equalisation by Lipshitz/Jung,&lt;ref&gt;'A High Accuracy Inverse RIAA Network' by Stanley Lipshitz and Walt Jung – The Audio Amateur, Issue 1/1980, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; though it was noted as unwanted. 
Some phono preamplifiers include additional circuitry to correct this and ensure that the output follows the RIAA curve accurately.&lt;ref name="Self"/&gt; In most, however, this is omitted.

==IEC RIAA curve==

In 1976, an alternative version of the replay curve (but not the recording curve) was proposed by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], differing from the RIAA replay curve only in the addition of a pole at 7950&amp;nbsp;µs (approximately 20&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;Amendment No. 4 to 'Processed Disk Records and Reproducing Equipment' (IEC 60098, 2nd Edition, January 1964), IEC Publication 60098/AMD4, Geneva, Switzerland, September 1976 (withdrawn in June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The justification was to reduce the subsonic output of the phono amplifier caused by disk warp and turntable rumble.

This so-called IEC Amendment to the RIAA curve is not universally seen as desirable, as it introduces considerable amplitude and—of more concern—phase errors into the low-frequency response during playback. The simple first-order roll-off also provides only very mild reduction of rumble,&lt;ref name="Self"/&gt;  and many manufacturers consider that turntables, arm and cartridge combinations should be of sufficient quality for problems not to arise.

Some manufacturers follow the IEC standard, others do not, while the remainder make this IEC-RIAA option user selectable. It remains subject to debate some 35 years later.&lt;ref name="stereophile2009"/&gt; This IEC Amendment was withdrawn in June 2009, though.

==TELDEC/DIN Curve==
Telefunken and Decca founded a record company (Teldec) that used a characteristic proposed for German DIN-Standard on July 1957: DIN45533, DIN45536, DIN45537. It is similar, but not identical, to the RIAA. The extent of usage of this curve is unclear.

Time constants: 3180&amp;nbsp;µs (50&amp;nbsp;Hz), 318&amp;nbsp;µs (500&amp;nbsp;Hz), and 50&amp;nbsp;µs (3183&amp;nbsp;Hz). Compare to RIAA time constants 3180&amp;nbsp;µs (50&amp;nbsp;Hz), 318&amp;nbsp;µs (500&amp;nbsp;Hz), and 75&amp;nbsp;µs (2122&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vinylengine.com/cartridge_database_record_equalization.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''referential indeterminacy''' is a situation in which different people vary in naming objects. For example, [[William Labov]] studied this effect using illustrations of different drinking vessels to see what people would label as "cups" and what people would label as "mugs".

'''Roberta Perkins'''&amp;nbsp;(1949 – 26 June 2018) was an Australian [[sociologist]], writer, and [[transgender]] rights and [[sex worker]] rights activist. She wrote several books and multiple academic articles on the semi-nomadic lives of transgender sex workers, and established the first assistance center for transgender people in Australia.

== Biography ==
Perkins completed her doctoral dissertation at [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney, in 1981. Her dissertation surveyed the lives and experiences of drag queens and transsexuals, and was one of the first ever doctoral works by an openly transgender woman.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Roberta Perkins (1940–2018) sociologist, activist |url=https://zagria.blogspot.com/2018/07/roberta-perkins-1940-2018-sociologist.html |website=A Gender Variance Who's Who |accessdate=14 September 2018 |date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, she was an early member of the then newly-created Australian Transsexual Association, which supported trans people by lobbying for social and legal reform.

In 1983, she published her first book, ''The Drag Queen Scene: Transsexuals in Kings Cross'', a survey of 146 drag queens based upon her dissertation. [[Frank Walker (Australian politician)|Frank Walker]], [[New South Wales]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Assembly person and at that time Minister for Youth and Community Services, read the book, and invited Perkins to meet. She told him about the poverty, homelessness and violence experienced by transgender sex workers, many of them youths; about the rape, beatings, harassment, and evictions, and how trans women could find no aid in either men's or women's shelters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gendercentre.org.au/resources/news-affecting-the-community/item/vale-roberta-perkins-1940-2018 Roberta Perkins (1940–2018)], Katherine Cummings, June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;Walker understood the gravity of the situation, and expressed his commitment to help. As a result, Perkins received a grant of AU$80,000 to open a center that would operate as a shelter for transgender sex workers. The home, originally called "Tiresias House", opened in Sydney with 12 beds, which were immediately filled. The center quickly grew, and within a few years included four houses, and had on permanent staff a registered nurse and a community worker. After six years, its name changed to the Gender Centre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/trans-sex-worker-activist-roberta-perkins-mourned-community/169935 Trans Sex Worker Activist Roberta Perkins Mourned By Community], Jesse Jones, Star Observer, 28 June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins left the Gender Centre in 1985, to concentrate on writing and publishing books and articles in academic publications about transgender women and sex workers. She was a noted figure in the struggle for [[sex worker rights]]&amp;nbsp;in New South Wales and Australia as a whole. She was a founding member of the&amp;nbsp;Australian Prostitutes Collective NSW, which advocated for [[decriminalization]] of sex work and for the improvement of sex workers' lives. The collective's work is continued today by the Sex Worker Outreach Project (SWOP) NSW.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Perkins died on 26 June 2018, at the age of 78. Her obituaries called her a "trail-blazer"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and "a woman of action" who laid the groundwork for sex worker advocacy in her country, and benefited "countless" trans people and sex workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its acquisition by UC San Diego, Sally Ride Science implemented a variety of STEM-related educational initiatives. The company:
* organized 100 Sally Ride Science Festivals on college campuses around the country.&lt;ref name="SRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=https://sallyridescience.com|website=Sally Ride Science|accessdate=11 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111130712/https://sallyridescience.com/|archivedate=11 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* created and ran a National Engineering Design (TOYchallenge) competition for eight years and created a documentary film (''Some Assembly Required'') following five teams of boys and girls during the 2008 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/article/toy-challenge|title=^"TOYchallenge: A toy design contest encourages both girls and boys to take an interest in engineering."|website=Student Science|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* created 90 STEM and STEM careers books with comprehensive teacher guides, and more than 200 hands-on STEM investigations.&lt;ref name="SRS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Scientific temper''' is a way of life (defined in this context as an individual and social process of thinking and acting) which uses the [[scientific method]] and which may, consequently, include questioning, [[observation|observing]] [[physical body|physical]] [[reality]], [[experiment|testing]], [[hypothesis|hypothesizing]], analysing, and communicating (not necessarily in that order). "Scientific temper" describes an attitude which involves the application of [[logic]]. Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/09/22/stories/2005092200211700.htm|title=Scientific temper and the argumentative Indian |publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-09-25|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the first to use the phrase in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahanti|first1=Subodh|title=A Perspective on Scientific Temper in India|journal=Journal of Scientific Temper|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–62|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/article/view/1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave a descriptive explanation:
{{quote|"[What is needed] is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for [[truth]] and new [[knowledge]], the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived [[theory]], the hard discipline of the mind—all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems."&amp;nbsp;—[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1946) ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', p. 512}}

Nehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, [[aesthetics|beauty]], goodness and truth. Nehru also contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied "to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation." While religion tends to close the mind and produce "[[Social tolerance|intolerance]], [[credulity]] and [[superstition]], emotionalism and irrationalism", and "a temper of a dependent, unfree person", a scientific temper "is the temper of a [[freedom|free]] man". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of [[religion]], and "the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jawaharlal |last=1Nehru |title=The Discovery of India |edition= Centenary |publisher=Oxford: University Press |year=1989 |page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru states (that) "It is science alone that can solve the problems of [[malnutrition|hunger]] and [[poverty in India|poverty]], of insanitation and [[literacy in India|illiteracy]], of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kar|first1=Devi|title=THE NEED TO FOSTER A SCIENTIFIC TEMPER|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120821/jsp/opinion/story_15874879.jsp#.VJeYScFcBg|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by [[Charles Darwin]] when he said, "[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=Darwin Correspondence Project|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-12757|work=Darwin, C. R. to Aveling, E. B. 13 Oct 1880|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Karl Marx]] when he said, "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions."

"To develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform" is one of the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India|fundamental duties]] of the people of the [[Republic of India]], according to the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book| title = Introduction to the Constitution of India| last = Basu| first = Durga Das| year = 1993| edition = 15th| place = New Delhi| publisher = [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall of India]]| isbn = 81-203-0839-5| page = 131| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of India]], through the National Council for Science and Technology Communication, dedicated the 28 February [[National Science Day]] of 2014 to the theme "Fostering Scientific Temper" to spread Nehru's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keshavamurthy|first1=H.R.|title=Fostering Scientific Temper is Fundamental to Innovation and Progress|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=104309|publisher=Press Information Bureau, India|accessdate=22 December 2014|date=27 February 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources]] launched the scholarly serial ''Journal of Scientific Temper'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Journal of Scientific Temper''|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/index|publisher=NISCAIR, India|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seascape ecology''' is a scientific discipline that deals with the causes and [[Ecology|ecological]] consequences of spatial pattern in the [[marine environment]], drawing heavily on conceptual and analytical frameworks developed in terrestrial [[landscape ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Wiens JA, Wu J, Urban DL (2017) Chapter 16: Landscape ecologist’s perspectives on seascape ecology. p485-494. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Overview==

Seascape ecology, the application of landscape ecology concepts to the marine environment&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ (2017) Chapter 1: Introducing Seascape Ecology. p3-25. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; has been slowly emerging since the 1970s &lt;ref&gt;Sousa WP (1979) Disturbance in marine intertidal boulder fields: the nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. Ecology 60(6): 1225–1239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paine RT, Levin SA (1981) Intertidal landscapes: disturbance and the dynamics of pattern. Ecological Monographs 51(2): 145–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh WJ (1985) Reef fish community dynamics on small artificial reefs: the influence of isolation, habitat structure, and biogeography. Bulletin of Marine Science 36(2):357–376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele JH (1989) The ocean ‘landscape’. Landscape Ecology 3(3–4): 185–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones GP, Andrew NL (1992) Temperate reefs and the scope of seascape ecology. In Battershill CN, Schiel DR, Jones GP, Creese RG, MacDiarmid AB (eds) 2nd International Temperate Reef Symposium (7–10 January 1992). NIWA Marine, Auckland, pp. 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt;, yielding new ecological insights and showing growing potential to support the development of ecologically meaningful science-based management practices &lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Kneib RT, Simenstad C. (2011) Practicing coastal seascape ecology. Marine Ecology Progress Series 427, 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olds AD, Connolly RM, Pitt KA, Pittman SJ, Maxwell PS, Huijbers CM, Moore BR, Albert S, Rissik D, Babcock RC, Schlacher TA. (2016) Quantifying the conservation value of seascape connectivity: a global synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography 25(1):3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Lepczyk CA, Wedding LM, Parrain C (2017) Chapter 12: Advancing a holistic systems approach in applied seascape ecology. p367-389. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young MA, Wedding LM, Carr MH (2017) Applying landscape ecology for the design and evaluation of marine protected area networks. p429-464.In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. For marine systems, the application of landscape ecology came about through a recognition that many of the concepts developed in the theory of [[island biogeography]]&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur RH,Wilson EO (1967) The Theory of Island Biogeography. Monographs in Population Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff DS (1974) Equilibrium theory of island biogeography and ecology. Annual review of Ecology and Systematics, 5(1), pp.161-182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of patch dynamics (precursors to modern landscape ecology) could be applicable to a range of marine environments from plankton patches &lt;ref&gt;Steele JH (1978) Spatial Pattern in Plankton Communities. Plenum Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; to patch reefs &lt;ref&gt;Molles MC Jr (1978) Fish species diversity on model and natural reef patches: experimental insular biogeography. Ecological Monographs 48: 289–305.&lt;/ref&gt;, intertidal mussel beds &lt;ref&gt;Paine RT, Levin SA (1981) Intertidal landscapes: disturbance and the dynamics of pattern.
Ecological Monographs 51(2): 145–178.&lt;/ref&gt; and seagrasses meadows &lt;ref&gt;McNeill SE, Fairweather PG (1993) Single large or several small marine reserves? An experimental approach with seagrass fauna. Journal of Biogeography 1: 429–440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins BD, Bell SS (1994) Seagrass landscapes: a terrestrial approach to the marine subtidal environment. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 9(8): 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Progress in the ecological understanding of spatial patterning was not confined to shallow seafloor environments. For the [[open ocean]], advances in ocean observing systems since the 1970s have allowed scientists to map, classify, quantify and track dynamic spatial structure in the form of [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], [[surface roughness]], currents, runoff plumes, ice, temperature fronts and plankton patches using oceanographic technologies – a theme increasingly referred to as pelagic seascape ecology &lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo M, Secor DH, Browman HI (2016) Observing and managing seascapes: linking synoptic oceanography, ecological processes, and geospatial modelling. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 73(7), pp.1825-1830.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh MT, Hales B, Saraceno M, Spitz YH, White AE, Letelier RM (2014) Hierarchical and dynamic seascapes: A quantitative framework for scaling pelagic biogeochemistry and ecology. Progress in Oceanography, 120, pp.291-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes. p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.Subsurface structures too, such as [[Internal wave|internal waves]], [[Thermocline|thermoclines]], [[Halocline|haloclines]], boundary layers and stratification resulting in distinct layering of organisms, is increasingly being mapped and modelled in multiple dimensions.

Like landscape ecologists, seascape ecologists are interested in the spatially explicit geometry of patterns and the relationships between pattern, ecological processes and environmental change. A central tenet in landscape ecology is that patch context matters, where local conditions are influenced by attributes of the surroundings. For instance, the physical arrangement of objects in space, and their location relative to other things, influences how they function&lt;ref&gt;Bell SS, McCoy ED, Mushinsky HR (EDS.). 1991. Habitat structure: the physical arrangement of objects in space. Chapman and Hall, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A landscape ecologist will ask different questions focused at different scales than other scientists, such as: What are the ecological consequences of different shaped patches, patch size, quality, edge geometry, spatial arrangement and diversity of patches across the landscape? At what scale(s) is structure most influential? How do landscape patterns influence the way that animals find food, evade predators and interact with competitors? How does human activity alter the structure and function of landscapes?

Several guiding principles that exist at the core of landscape ecology have made major contributions to terrestrial landscape planning and conservation, but in marine systems our understanding is still in its infancy. The first book on seascape ecology was published in December 2017&lt;ref&gt;Seascape Ecology edited by Simon J. Pittman http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119084431.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Seascapes are defined broadly as spatially heterogeneous and dynamic spaces that can be delineated at a wide range of scales in time and space. With regard to seascapes defined by sampling units, a 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; quadrat can be a valid seascape sample unit (SSU), just as can a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analytical window in a geographical information system. The wide diversity of possible focal scales in marine ecology means that the term seascape cannot be used as an indication of scale, or a level of organisation.

== Seascape patterns ==
The sea exhibits complex spatial patterning that can be mapped and quantified, such as gradients in plant communities across [[Salt marsh|tidal saltmarshes]] or the intricate mosaics of patches typical of [[Coral reef|coral reefs]]&lt;ref&gt;Costa B, Walker BK, Dijkstra JA (2017) Chapter 2: Mapping and quantifying seascape patterns. p27-56. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. In the open ocean too, dynamic spatial structure in the form of water currents, eddies, temperature fronts and plankton patches can be measured readily&lt;ref&gt;Bakun A (1996) Patterns in the Ocean: Ocean Processes and Marine Population Dynamics.
University of California Sea Grant, San Diego, CA, United States in cooperation with
Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas de Noroeste, La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes.
 p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical processes such as storms dramatically influence spatial patterning in the environment and human activity can also directly create patch structure, modify mosaic composition and even completely remove elements of the seascape. Furthermore, climate-change induced shifts in species related to water temperature change and sea level rise are driving a gradual reconfiguration of the geography of species and habitats.

The patterns revealed by remote sensing devices are most often mapped and represented using two types of model: (1) collections of discrete patches forming mosaics e.g.  as represented in two-dimensional benthic habitat map, or (2) continuously varying gradients in three-dimensional terrain models e.g. in remotely sensed bathymetric data&lt;ref&gt;McGarigal K, Tagil S, Cushman SA (2009) Surface metrics: an alternative to patch metrics for the quantification of landscape structure. Landscape Ecology 24(3): 433–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wedding L, Lepczyk C, Pittman S, Friedlander A, Jorgensen S (2011) Quantifying seascape structure: extending terrestrial spatial pattern metrics to the marine realm. Marine Ecology Progress Series 427: 219–232.&lt;/ref&gt;. In landscape ecology, patches can be classified into a binary patch-matrix model based on island biogeography theory where a focal habitat patch type (e.g. seagrasses) is surrounded by an inhospitable matrix (e.g. sand), or a patch-mosaic of interconnected patches, where the interactions of the parts influence the ecological function of the whole mosaic. Both patch and gradient models have provided important insights into the spatial ecology of marine species and biodiversity.

== Scale matters ==
Scale, the spatial or temporal dimensions of a phenomenon, is central to seascape ecology and the topic permeates all applications of a seascape ecology approach from conceptual models through to design of sampling, analyses and interpretation of results&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2001) The rise of the concept of scale in ecology: The concept of scale is evolving from verbal expression to quantitative expression. BioScience 51(7): 545–553.&lt;/ref&gt;. Species and life-stage responses to patchiness and gradients in environmental structure are likely to be scale dependent, therefore, scale selection is an important task in any ecological study. Seascape ecology acknowledges that decisions made for scaling ecological studies influence our perspective and ultimately our understanding of ecological patterns and processes&lt;ref&gt;Levin SA (1992) The problem of pattern and scale in ecology. Ecology 73: 1943–1967.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historically, marine scientists have played a significant role in communicating the importance of scale in ecology&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2017) Chapter 4: Scale and scaling in seascape ecology. p89-117. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, a physical oceanographer, [[Henry Stommel]], published a conceptual diagram that was to have a profound effect on all of the environmental sciences &lt;ref&gt;Vance TC, Doel RE (2010) Graphical methods and cold war scientific practice: The Stommel diagram’s intriguing journey from the physical to the biological environmental sciences. Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences 40: 1–47.&lt;/ref&gt;. The diagram &lt;ref&gt;Stommel H (1963) Varieties of oceanographic experience. Science 139: 572–576.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted variation in sea level height at spatial scales from centimetres to that of the planet and at time scales from seconds to tens of millennia&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2017) Chapter 4: Scale and scaling in seascape ecology. p89-117. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;. The oceanographer [[John Steele (oceanographer)|John Steele]] (1978) adapted the Stommel diagram to depict the spatial and temporal scales of patchiness in [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] and [[fish]].
[[File:Seascape scales.jpg|thumb|Seascape scales]]
Measuring habitat structure at multiple scales is typical in seascape ecology, particularly where a single meaningful scale is not known or not meaningful to the ecological process of interest. Multi-scale measurements have been used to discover the scale at which populations are associated with key habitat features&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC, Piatt JF (1986) Scale-dependent correlation of seabirds with schooling fish in a coastal ecosystem. Marine Ecological Progress Series 32: 237–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Brown KA (2011) Multi-scale approach for predicting fish species distributions across coral reef seascapes. PLoS ONE 6(5): e20583.&lt;/ref&gt;. With regard to scaling seascapes, one approach is to select spatial and temporal scales to be ecologically meaningful to the organism’s movements or other processes of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Hile SD, Caldow, C &amp; Monaco ME (2007) Using seascape types to explain the spatial patterns of fish using mangroves in Puerto Rico. Marine Ecology Progress Series 348, 273-284&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of information, or the lack of continuous observation on the way animals use space through time, can all too often result in insufficient consideration of seascape context potentially resulting in misleading conclusions on the primary drivers of ecological patterns and processes. Pittman and McAlpine (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ &amp; McAlpine CA (2003) Movements of marine fish and decapod crustaceans: Process, theory and application. Advances in Marine Biology 44, 205-294.&lt;/ref&gt; offer a multi-scale framework for scaling ecological studies that integrates hierarchy theory with movement ecology and the concept of ecological neighborhoods&lt;ref&gt;Addicott JF, Aho JM, Antolin MF, Padilla DK, Richardson JS, Soluk DA (1987) Ecological neighborhoods: scaling environmental patterns. Oikos 1:340-346.&lt;/ref&gt;. Here the focal scale is guided by the spatial and temporal scales relevant to an ecological process of interest. The focal scale is nested within a spatial hierarchy that incorporates patterns and processes at both finer and broader scales&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Davis B, Santos-Corujo RO (2017) Chapter 7: Animal movements through the seascape: Integrating movement ecology with seascape ecology. p189-227. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the  function ''f'', [[piecewise]] defined by ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= –1 for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. This function is upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, but not lower semi-continuous.

[[Image:Lower semi.svg|thumb|right|A lower semi-continuous function. The solid blue dot indicates ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).]]
The [[indicator function]] of a [[closed set]] is upper semi-continuous, whereas the indicator function of an [[open set]] is lower semi-continuous. The [[floor function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number ''x'', is everywhere upper semi-continuous. Similarly, the [[ceiling function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt; is lower semi-continuous.

A function may be upper or lower semi-continuous without being either [[Continuous function#Directional and semi-continuity|left or right continuous]]. For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
               1   &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 1,\\
               2   &amp; \mbox{if } x = 1,\\
               1/2 &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 1,
               \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
is upper semi-continuous at ''x'' = 1 although not left or right continuous.  The limit from the left is equal to 1 and the limit from the right is equal to 1/2, both of which are different from the function value of 2.  Similarly the function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \begin{cases}
                \sin(1/x) &amp; \mbox{if } x \neq 0,\\
                1         &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0,
                \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is upper semi-continuous at ''x'' = 0 while the function limits from the left or right at zero do not even exist.

If &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a Euclidean space (or more generally, a metric space) and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=C([0,1],X)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of [[curve]]s in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (with the [[supremum norm|supremum distance]] &lt;math&gt;d_\Gamma(\alpha,\beta)=\sup_t\ d_X(\alpha(t),\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;, then the length functional &lt;math&gt;L:\Gamma\to[0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, which assigns to each curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; its [[Curve#Length of curves|length]] &lt;math&gt;L(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, is lower semicontinuous.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a measure space and let &lt;math&gt;L^+(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of positive measurable functions endowed with the
topology of [[convergence in measure]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by [[Fatou's lemma]] the integral, seen as an operator from &lt;math&gt;L^+(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[-\infty,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is lower semi-continuous.

== Formal definition ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]], &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is an extended real-valued function.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''upper semi-continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \leq f(x_0) + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) &gt; -\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends towards &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

For the particular case of a metric space, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x\to x_{0}} f(x)\le f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where lim sup is the [[limit superior]] (of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;). (For non-metric spaces, an equivalent definition using [[net (mathematics)|net]]s may be stated.)

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called upper semi-continuous if it is upper semi-continuous at every point of its [[domain (function)|domain]]. A function is upper semi-continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x \in X: ~f(x) &lt; \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set]] for every &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''lower semi-continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \geq f(x_0) - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) &lt; +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends towards &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, in the case of a metric space, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x\to x_0} f(x)\ge f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\liminf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[limit inferior]] (of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;).

The function ''f'' is called lower semi-continuous if it is lower semi-continuous at every point of its domain. A function is lower semi-continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X : ~f(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set]] for every α&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''; alternatively, a function is lower semi-continuous if and only if all of its lower [[level set|levelset]]s &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X: ~f(x)\leq\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[closed set|closed]]&lt;!-- a formulation useful in [[optimization theory|minimization theory]], for [[Weierstrauss's theorem]] on the existence of a minimum for an inf-compact function, or for the definition of a quasi-convex function by the convexity of lower level sets, etc. --&gt;. Lower level sets are also called ''[[level set|sublevel sets]]'' or ''trenches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kiwiel|first=Krzysztof C.|title=Convergence and efficiency of subgradient methods for quasiconvex minimization|journal=Mathematical Programming  (Series A)|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|issn=0025-5610|pages=1–25|volume=90|issue=1|doi=10.1007/PL00011414|year=2001|mr=1819784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

A function is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is upper and lower semi-continuous there. Therefore, semi-continuity can be used to prove continuity.

If ''f'' and ''g'' are two real-valued functions which are both upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then so is ''f'' + ''g''. If both functions are non-negative, then the product function ''fg'' will also be upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The same holds for functions lower semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puterman|first1=Martin L.|title=Markov Decision Processes Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-72782-8|pages=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Function composition|composition]] ''f''∘''g'' of upper semi-continuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' is not necessarily upper semi-continuous, but if ''f'' is also non-decreasing, then ''f''∘''g'' is upper semi-continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=James C.|title=Mathematical methods for economic theory|date=1999|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540662358|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplying a positive upper semi-continuous function with a negative number turns it into a lower semi-continuous function.

If ''C'' is a [[compact space]] (for instance a [[closed set|closed]], [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']) and ''f'' : ''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[–∞,∞) is upper semi-continuous, then ''f'' has a maximum on ''C''. The analogous statement for (–∞,∞]-valued lower semi-continuous functions and minima is also true. (See the article on the [[extreme value theorem]] for a proof.)

Suppose ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[–∞,∞] is a lower semi-continuous function for every index ''i'' in a nonempty set ''I'', and define ''f'' as pointwise [[supremum]], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sup_{i\in I}f_i(x),\qquad x\in X.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''f'' is lower semi-continuous. Even if all the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are continuous, ''f'' need not be continuous: indeed every lower semi-continuous function on a [[uniform space]] (e.g. a [[metric space]]) arises as the supremum of a sequence of continuous functions.

Likewise, the pointwise [[infimum]] of an arbitrary collection of upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous.

The [[indicator function]] of any open set is lower semicontinuous. The indicator function of a closed set is upper semicontinuous. However, in convex analysis, the term "indicator function" often refers to the [[Characteristic function (convex analysis)|characteristic function]], and the characteristic function of any ''closed'' set is lower semicontinuous, and the characteristic function of any ''open'' set is upper semicontinuous.

A function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→'''R''' is lower semicontinuous if and only if its [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] (the set of points lying on or above its [[graph of a function|graph]]) is [[Closed set|closed]].

A function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''→'''R''', for some topological space ''X'', is lower semicontinuous if and only if it is continuous with respect to the [[Scott topology]] on '''R'''.

Any upper semicontinuous function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''→'''N''' on an arbitrary topological space ''X'' is locally constant on some [[dense set|dense open subset]] of ''X''.

The maximum and minimum of finitely many upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous, and the same holds true of lower semicontinuous functions.

'''Sonic characteristics of marine species''' - Noise in the [[ocean]] is of utmost importance for ocean explorations, [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] as well as [[fisheries]] studies, [[sonar]] operations, etc. The wide range of systems for ocean research demands the need for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean. The ambient noise in the ocean is composite in nature, with components emanating from a variety of noise sources. The problem of identification of noise sources in the ocean is of prime importance because of its diverse practical applications. In view of the importance of the area of identification of noise sources, there is a need and requirement for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean which are of both man made and biological in origin.

The '''stellar atmosphere''' is the outer region of the volume of a [[star]], lying above the [[Solar core|stellar core]], [[radiation zone]] and [[convection zone]].

==Overview==
The stellar atmosphere is divided into several regions of distinct character:

* The [[photosphere]], which is the atmosphere's lowest and coolest layer, is normally its only visible part.&lt;ref name = "BrightPS"/&gt; [[Light]] escaping from the surface of the star stems from this region and passes through the higher layers. The [[Sun]]'s photosphere has a [[effective temperature|temperature]] in the 5,770&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] to 5,780&amp;nbsp;K range.&lt;ref name = "lowTemp"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Mariska |first1= J.T. |title= The solar transition region |series = Cambridge Astrophysics Series  |url = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521382618&amp;ss=toc  |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]  |isbn=  978-0-521-38261-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "higherTemp"/&gt; [[Starspot]]s, cool regions of disrupted [[magnetic field]] lie on the photosphere.&lt;ref name = "higherTemp"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Lang |first1= K.R. |title= Sun, earth, and sky  |edition= 2nd   |date=September 2006  |publisher= Springer  |isbn= 978-0-387-30456-4  |page= 81 |chapter= 5.1 MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE VISIBLE PHOTOSPHERE |quote= this opaque layer is the photosphere, the level of the Sun from which we get our light and heat  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Above the photosphere lies the [[chromosphere]]. This part of the atmosphere first cools down and then starts to heat up to about 10 times the temperature of the photosphere.
* Above the chromosphere lies the [[solar transition region|transition region]], where the temperature increases rapidly on a distance of only around 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Mariska |first1= J.T. |title= The solar transition region  |isbn=  978-0-521-38261-8 |page = 60 |quote = 100 km suggested by average models  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The outermost part of the stellar atmosphere is the [[corona]], a tenuous [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] which has a temperature above one million Kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= R.C. Altrock |date=  2004 |title= The Temperature of the Low Corona During Solar Cycles 21–23  |journal= Solar Physics   |volume= 224 |page = 255  |doi= 10.1007/s11207-005-6502-4 |bibcode = 2004SoPh..224..255A }}&lt;/ref&gt; While all stars on the [[main sequence]] feature transition regions and coronae, not all [[Stellar evolution|evolved stars]] do so. It seems that only some [[giant star|giants]], and very few [[supergiant]]s, possess coronae. [[Corona#Coronal heating problem|An unresolved problem]] in stellar [[astrophysics]] is how the corona can be heated to such high temperatures. The answer lies in [[magnetic field]]s, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/mysteries_l1/corona.html |title= The Sun's Corona – Introduction   |publisher= [[NASA]] |accessdate= 2010-05-21 | quote = Now most scientists believe that the heating of the corona is linked to the interaction of the magnetic field lines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a total [[solar eclipse]], the photosphere of the Sun is [[occultation|obscured]], revealing its atmosphere's other layers.&lt;ref name = "BrightPS"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and its corona is seen as a tufted [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]. The same phenomenon in [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binaries]] can make the chromosphere of giant stars visible.&lt;ref&gt;

Other notable examples include solving [[partial differential equations]],&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; the [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] kernel, the [[Gauss–Seidel method]],&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; [[image processing]]&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; and [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]].&lt;ref name="Fey"&gt;

The regular structure of the arrays sets stencil codes apart from other modeling methods such as the [[Finite element method]]. Most [[Finite difference method|finite difference codes]] which operate on regular grids can be formulated as stencil codes.

==Definition==
Stencil codes perform a sequence of sweeps (called timesteps) through a given array.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Generally this is a 2- or 3-dimensional regular grid.&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt; The elements of the arrays are often referred to as cells. In each timestep, the stencil code updates all array elements.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Using neighboring array elements in a fixed pattern (called the stencil), each cell's new value is computed. In most cases boundary values are left unchanged, but in some cases (e.g. [[Lattice Boltzmann methods|LBM codes]]) those need to be adjusted during the computation as well. Since the stencil is the same for each element, the pattern of data accesses is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, we may define stencil codes as a [[N-tuple|5-tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(I, S, S_0, s, T)&lt;/math&gt; with the following meaning:&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I = \prod_{i=1}^k [0, \ldots, n_i]&lt;/math&gt; is the index set. It defines the topology of the array.
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the (not necessarily finite) set of states, one of which each cell may take on on any given timestep.
* &lt;math&gt;S_0\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; defines the initial state of the system at time 0.
* &lt;math&gt;s \in \prod_{i=1}^l \Z^k&lt;/math&gt; is the stencil itself and describes the actual shape of the neighborhood. There are &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; elements in the stencil.
* &lt;math&gt;T\colon S^l \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the transition function which is used to determine a cell's new state, depending on its neighbors.

Since ''I'' is a ''k''-dimensional integer interval, the array will always have the topology of a finite regular grid. The array is also called simulation space and individual cells are identified by their index &lt;math&gt;c \in I&lt;/math&gt;. The stencil is an ordered set of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; relative coordinates. We can now obtain for each cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the tuple of its neighbors indices &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = c + x\} \, &lt;/math&gt; 

Their states are given by mapping the tuple &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding tuple of states &lt;math&gt;N_i(c)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_i\colon I \to S^l&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
N_i(c) = (s_1, \ldots, s_l) \text{ with } s_j = S_i(I_c(j)) \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is all we need to define the system's state for the following time steps &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \in \N&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
S_{i+1}(c) = \begin{cases}T(N_i(c)), &amp; c \in I\\
                           S_i(c),    &amp; c \in \Z^k \setminus I  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\Z^k&lt;/math&gt; and not just on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; since the boundary conditions need to be set, too. Sometimes the elements of &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by a vector addition modulo the simulation space's dimension to realize toroidal topologies:

: &lt;math&gt;
I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = ((c + x) \mod(n_1, \ldots,  n_k))\}
&lt;/math&gt; 

This may be useful for implementing [[periodic boundary conditions]], which simplifies certain physical models.

=== Example: 2D Jacobi iteration ===

[[File:2D von Neumann Stencil.svg|thumb|right|Data dependencies of a selected cell in the 2D array.]]

To illustrate the formal definition, we'll have a look at how a two dimensional [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] iteration can be defined. The update function computes the arithmetic mean of a cell's four neighbors. In this case we set off with an initial solution of 0. The left and right boundary are fixed at 1, while the upper and lower boundaries are set to 0. After a sufficient number of iterations, the system converges against a saddle-shape.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I &amp; = [0, \ldots, 99]^2 \\
S &amp; = \R \\
S_0 &amp;: \Z^2 \to \R \\
S_0((x, y)) &amp; = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
0, &amp; 0 \le x &lt; 100 \\
1, &amp; x \ge 100
        \end{cases}\\
s &amp; = ((0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)) \\
T &amp;\colon \R^4 \to \R \\
T((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) &amp; = 0.25 \cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Stencils==

The shape of the neighborhood used during the updates depends on the application itself. The most common stencils are the 2D or 3D versions of the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] and [[Moore neighborhood]]. The example above uses a 2D von Neumann stencil while LBM codes generally use its 3D variant. [[Conway's Game of Life]] uses the 2D Moore neighborhood. That said, other stencils such as a 25-point stencil for seismic wave propagation&lt;ref&gt;

==Implementation issues==
Many simulation codes may be formulated naturally as stencil codes. Since computing time and memory consumption grow linearly with the number of array elements, parallel implementations of stencil codes are of paramount importance to research.&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;
  Datta, Kaushik (2009) 
  ''[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kdatta/pubs/EECS-2009-177.pdf Auto-tuning Stencil Codes for Cache-Based Multicore Platforms]'', 
  Ph.D. Thesis
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is challenging since the computations are tightly coupled (because of the cell updates depending on neighboring cells) and most stencil codes are memory bound (i.e. the ratio of memory accesses to calculations is high).&lt;ref name="Wellein"&gt;
  Wellein, G et al. (2009)

  33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Virtually all current parallel architectures have been explored for executing stencil codes efficiently;&lt;ref name="datta2"&gt;

  SC '08 Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing
&lt;/ref&gt; 
at the moment [[GPGPU]]s have proven to be most efficient.&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;

  Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries==
Due to both the importance of stencil codes to [[computer simulation]]s and their high computational requirements, there are a number of efforts which aim at creating reusable libraries to support scientists in implementing new stencil codes. The libraries are mostly concerned with the parallelization, but may also tackle other challenges, such as IO, [[Computational steering|steering]] and [[Application checkpointing|checkpointing]]. They may be classified by their API.

===Patch-based libraries===
This is a traditional design. The library manages a set of ''n''-dimensional scalar arrays, which the user code may access to perform updates. The library handles the synchronization of the boundaries (dubbed ghost zone or halo). The advantage of this interface is that the user code may loop over the arrays, which makes it easy to integrate legacy codes&lt;ref name="walberla"&gt;
  S. Donath, J. Götz, C. Feichtinger, K. Iglberger and U. Rüde (2010)
  ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2583237l2187374/ waLBerla: Optimization for Itanium-based Systems with Thousands of Processors]'',
  High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering, Garching/Munich 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;
. The disadvantage is that the library can not handle cache blocking (as this has to be done within the loops&lt;ref name="35dblocking"&gt;
  Nguyen, Anthony et al. (2010)
  ''[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1884658 3.5-D Blocking Optimization for Stencil Computations on Modern CPUs and GPUs]'',
  SC '10 Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt;)
or wrapping of the code for accelerators (e.g. via CUDA or OpenCL). Notable implementations include [http://cactuscode.org/ Cactus], a physics problem solving environment, and [http://walberla.net/ waLBerla].

===Cell-based libraries===
These libraries move the interface to updating single simulation cells: only the current cell and its neighbors are exposed to the user code, e.g. via getter/setter methods. The advantage of this approach is that the library can control tightly which cells are updated in which order, which is useful not only to implement cache blocking,&lt;ref name=schaefer /&gt; 
but also to run the same code on multi-cores and GPUs.&lt;ref name="physis"&gt;
  Naoya Maruyama, Tatsuo Nomura, Kento Sato, and Satoshi Matsuoka (2011)
  ''Physis: An Implicitly Parallel Programming Model for Stencil Computations on Large-Scale GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers'',
  SC '11 Proceedings of the 2011 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires the user to recompile the source code together with the library. Otherwise a function call for every cell update would be required, which would seriously impair performance. This is only feasible with techniques such as [[Template (programming)|class templates]] or [[metaprogramming]], which is also the reason why this design is only found in newer libraries. Examples are [https://github.com/naoyam/physis Physis] and [http://www.libgeodecomp.org LibGeoDecomp].

The '''University of Toronto''' ('''U of T''',&lt;!-- Do not add UT, since it is used as a part of longer abbreviations, such as UTM, UTSC, and UTSU, but not as a standalone abbreviation --&gt; '''UToronto''', or '''Toronto'''&lt;!-- Do not added Toronto U, because it would refer to Toronto University, which is an incorrect name --&gt;) is a [[public university|public]]&lt;!-- Public universities are public-assisted in nature --&gt; [[research university]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], located on the grounds that surround [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]]. It was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1827 as ''King's College'', the first institution of higher learning in the colony of [[Upper Canada]]. Originally controlled by the [[Church of England]], the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a [[collegiate university]], it comprises eleven [[college]]s, which differ in character and history, each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs. It has two satellite campuses in [[University of Toronto Scarborough|Scarborough]] and [[University of Toronto Mississauga|Mississauga]].

The university is commonly [[Rankings of universities in Canada|ranked as the best Canadian university]], according to various major publications. Academically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in [[literary criticism]] and [[communication theory]], known collectively as the [[Toronto School of communication theory|Toronto School]]. The university was the birthplace of [[insulin]] and [[stem cell]] research, and was the site of the first practical [[electron microscope]], the development of [[multi-touch]] technology, the identification of the first [[black hole]] [[Cygnus X-1]], and the development of the theory of [[NP-completeness]]. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual [[Funding of science|scientific research funding]] of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the [[Association of American Universities]] outside the United States, the other being [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5474 |title=Association of American Universities |publisher=Aau.edu |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114071434/http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5474 |archivedate=January 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toronto Varsity Blues|Varsity Blues]] are the athletic teams that represent the university in intercollegiate league matches, with long and storied ties to [[gridiron football]] and [[ice hockey]]. The earliest recorded [[college football]] game was played in the University of Toronto's University College in the 1860s. The university's [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] is an early example of the North American [[student center|student centre]], simultaneously serving cultural, intellectual, and recreational interests within its large [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic-revival]] complex.

The University of Toronto has educated three [[Governor General of Canada|Governors General of Canada]], four [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Ministers of Canada]], four foreign leaders, and fourteen [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada|Justices of the Supreme Court]]. As of 2018, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|ten Nobel laureates]], [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation|three Turing Award winners]], 94 Rhodes Scholars, and [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|one Fields Medalist]] have been affiliated with the university.

[[CIUT-FM]] is the university's [[campus radio]] station, while the University of Toronto Television broadcasts student-produced content. Students at each college and academic faculty also produce their own set of journals and news publications.  University College's ''[[The Gargoyle (newspaper)|The Gargoyle]]'' was an early training ground for such notables as journalist [[Naomi Klein]], and musician/comedian [[Paul Shaffer]].  Victoria University's ''[[Acta Victoriana]]'' is the oldest active literary journal in Canada, and provided first publication credits to such literary figures as [[Margaret Atwood]] and [[Northrop Frye]].

Members of the student press have contributed to activist causes on several notable occasions. At the height of debate on coeducation in 1880, ''The Varsity'' published an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women.&lt;ref name="historyQA_women"/&gt; In 1895, the university suspended the editor of ''The Varsity'' for breach of collegiality, after he published a letter that harshly criticized the provincial government's dismissal of a professor and involvement in academic affairs. University College students then approved a motion by ''Varsity'' staff member and future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and boycotted lectures for a week.&lt;ref name="historyQA_king"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history17.htm |title=What made the "blood fairly boil" in U of T student and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1895? |accessdate=September 24, 2007 |work=History Q &amp; A |publisher=University of Toronto Department of Public Affairs |year=2002}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7908&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=uhlbmjtm0fc5n5ibvqbk5ipp75 |title=Dale, William |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |last=Marshall |first=David B. |work=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] [[LGBT rights in Canada|decriminalized homosexuality throughout Canada in 1969]], a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in ''The Varsity'' seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbebout.com/oldbeep/concep.htm |title=Conception &amp; birth |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |work=On the Origins of the Body Politic |last=Bébout |first=Rick |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residences===
[[File:Teefy Hall.JPG|right|thumb|Teefy House, a residence hall of [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St. Michael's College]], is home to female first-year undergraduate students. ]]
Each college at the University of Toronto operates its own set of [[residence hall]]s and [[Cafeteria|dining halls]] clustered in a different area of the campus. Innis, New, St. Michael's, Trinity, University, Victoria, and Woodsworth colleges reserve most of their dormitories for their undergraduate students within the Faculty of Arts and Science, while setting a portion available to students from the professional and postgraduate faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Engineering, Music, and Phys.

[[Annesley Hall]] of Victoria College, a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]], was the first university residence for women in Canada. After [[St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto|St. Hilda's College]] became coeducational in 2005, Annesley Hall and Loretto College of St. Michael's College are the last remaining women's halls at the university.

As campus residences accommodate just 6,400 students in all, the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates in their first year of study, while most upper-year and graduate students reside off-campus.&lt;ref name="factsandfigures"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Residence Guarantee |url=http://www.housing.utoronto.ca/residence/firstYear.html |publisher=Student Housing Service, University of Toronto |year=2008 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805003623/http://housing.utoronto.ca/residence/firstYear.html |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the adjacent neighbourhoods of [[The Annex]] and [[Harbord Village]] are popular settling grounds for University of Toronto students, forming a distinct [[student quarter]] enclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Middle Class and the Remaking of the Central City |last=Ley |first=David |year=1996 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-823292-6 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Schackner |title=For collegians in Canada, drinking is no big thing |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=July 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07189/800188-51.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the university purchased and converted a nearby hotel into the [[Chestnut Residence]], which houses students from all colleges and faculties. There are also numerous fraternity houses and [[student housing cooperative]]s, where boarders pay reduced rent for assuming housekeeping duties.

[[Image:CVRD6windrow.matureing.jpg|thumb|right|Maturing windrows at an [[in-vessel composting]] facility.]]
In [[agriculture]], '''windrow composting''' is the production of [[compost]] by piling [[organic matter]] or [[biodegradable waste]], such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (''[[windrow]]s''). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale [[composting]] method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.

The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce [[compost]] on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4&amp;nbsp;feet (1.25&amp;nbsp;meters) or more high, by as much as 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air ([[oxygen]]) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial [[decomposition]] are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using [[four wheel drive]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a [[self-trailering]] option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck [[tractor]]. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or [[vinasse]]. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8&amp;nbsp;liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has [[Chemical_oxygen_demand|COD]] of 1,50,000 PPM and [[Biochemical_oxygen_demand|BOD]] of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100&amp;nbsp;meters long windrows of 3&amp;nbsp;meters x 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that a 100&amp;nbsp;meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415&amp;nbsp;m³ of Spent wash in 50&amp;nbsp;days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1&amp;nbsp;kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.

'''Wolfram Alpha''' (also styled '''WolframAlpha''', and '''Wolfram|Alpha''') is a computational knowledge engine&lt;ref name=Guardiandatasource&gt;{{cite news |title=Where does Wolfram Alpha get its information? |author=Bobbie Johnson |publisher=The Guardian |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/21/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[answer engine]] developed by Wolfram Alpha LLC, a subsidiary of [[Wolfram Research]]. It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced "curated data",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Wolfram{{!}}Alpha: Making the World's Knowledge Computable|url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html|website=wolframalpha.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a [[search engine]] might.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/09/search-engine-google |title=British search engine 'could rival Google' |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=March 9, 2009 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=UK |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram Alpha, which was released on May 18, 2009, is based on Wolfram's earlier flagship product [[Wolfram Mathematica]], a computational platform or toolkit that encompasses computer algebra, symbolic and numerical computation, visualization, and statistics capabilities.&lt;ref name="launch date" /&gt; Additional data is gathered from both academic and commercial websites such as the CIA's ''[[The World Factbook]]'', the [[United States Geological Survey]], a Cornell University Library publication called ''[https://www.allaboutbirds.org/ All About Birds]'', ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', [[Dow Jones]], the ''[[Catalogue of Life]]'',&lt;ref name=Guardiandatasource /&gt; [[CrunchBase]],&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite news |last=Dillet |first=Romain |title=Wolfram Alpha Makes CrunchBase Data Computable Just In Time For Disrupt SF |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/wolfram-alpha-makes-crunchbase-data-computable-just-in-time-for-disrupt/ |publisher=TechCrunch |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Best Buy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Golson |first=Jordan |title=Wolfram Delivers Siri-Enabled Shopping Results From Best Buy |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/12/16/wolfram-delivers-siri-enabled-shopping-results-from-best-buy/ |publisher=MacRumors |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barylick |first=Chris |title=Wolfram Alpha search engine now tracks flight paths, trajectory information |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/19/wolfram-alpha-search-engine-now-tracks-flight-paths-trajectory/ |publisher=Engadget |date=November 19, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and optionally a user's Facebook account.

== Overview ==
Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field.  Wolfram Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a [[knowledge base]] of [[Data curation|curated]], [[structured data]] that come from other sites and books. The site "use[s] a portfolio of automated and manual methods, including statistics, visualization, source cross-checking, and expert review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data in Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/faqs5.html |website=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curated data makes Alpha different from [[semantic search]] engines, which index a large number of answers and then try to match the question to one.

Wolfram Alpha can only provide robust query results based on computational facts, not queries on the social sciences, cultural studies or even many questions about history where responses require more subtlety and complexity. It is able to respond to particularly-phrased [[natural language understanding|natural language]] fact-based questions such as "Where was [[Mary Robinson]] born?" or more complex questions such as "How old was [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1974?" It displays its "Input interpretation" of such a question, using standardized phrases such as "age | of Queen Elizabeth II (royalty) | in 1974", the answer of which is "Age at start of 1974: 47 years", and a biography link. Wolfram Alpha does not answer queries which require a narrative response such as "What is the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars?" but will answer factual or computational questions such as "June 1 in Julian calendar".

Mathematical symbolism can be parsed by the engine, which typically responds with more than the numerical results. For example, "lim(x-&gt;0) (sin x)/x" yields the correct [[limit (functions)|limit]]ing value of 1, as well as a plot, up to 235 terms ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) of the [[Taylor series]], and (for registered users) a possible derivation using [[L'Hôpital's rule]]. It is also able to perform calculations on data using more than one source. For example, "What is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifty-second smallest]] country by [[GDP per capita]]?" yields [[Nicaragua]], $1160 per year.

== Technology ==
Wolfram Alpha is written in 15 million lines of [[Wolfram Language]] code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WolframResearch |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56ISaies6Ws#t=927s |title=Stephen Wolfram: The Background and Vision of Mathematica |publisher=Youtube.com |date=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs on more than 10,000 CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |url=http://readwrite.com/2009/04/25/wolframalpha_our_first_impressions |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha: Our First Impressions |date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/05/15/wolframalpha-is-launching-made-possible-by-mathematica/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Is Launching: Made Possible by ''Mathematica'' |work=WolframAlpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently includes hundreds of datasets, such as "All Current and Historical Weather." The datasets have been accumulated over several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taking a first bite out of Wolfram Alpha | first=Jane Fae | last=Ozimek |work=The Register |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/18/wolfram_alpha/ |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curated (as distinct from auto-generated) datasets are checked for quality either by a scientist or other expert in a relevant field, or someone acting in a clerical capacity who simply verifies that the datasets are "acceptable".&lt;ref name=semanticabyss&gt;{{cite web |title=The Semantic Abyss - Plumbing the Semantic Web: Exploring the depths of the semantic gap between the Semantic Web and real world users and consumers |url=http://semanticabyss.blogspot.ca/2009/03/what-is-curated-data.html |year=2009 |author=Jack Krupansky}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}

One example of a live dataset that Wolfram Alpha can use is the profile of a [[Facebook]] user, through inputting the "facebook report" query. If the user authorizes Facebook to share his or her account details with the Wolfram site, Alpha can generate a "personal analytics" report containing the age distribution of friends, the frequency of words used in status updates and other detailed information.&lt;ref name=techland&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas E. |last=Weber |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/05/wolfram-alphas-facebook-analytics-tool-digs-deep-into-your-social-life/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Facebook Analytics Tool Digs Deep into Your Social Life |work=Tech |publisher=Time Magazine |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks of launching the Facebook analytics service, 400,000 users had used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=R. |first=A. |title=Visualising Facebook Who am I? |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/09/visualising-facebook |publisher=The Economist |work=Graphic detail |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downloadable query results are behind a pay wall but summaries are accessible to free accounts.&lt;ref name=publiclibraries&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2013/03/a-wolf-or-a-ram-what-is-wolfram-alpha/ |title=A Wolf or a Ram?

== Licensing partners ==
Wolfram Alpha has been used to power some searches in the [[Microsoft]] [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[DuckDuckGo]] search engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Krazit |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10315117-265.html |title=Bing strikes licensing deal with Wolfram Alpha |publisher=CNET |date=August 21, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Team |date=April 18, 2011 |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/04/18/wolframalpha-and-duckduckgo-partner-on-api-binding-and-search-integration/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha and DuckDuckGo Partner on API Binding and Search Integration |work=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the first release on July 21, 2017, [[Brave (web browser)|Brave]] web browser features Wolfram Alpha as one of its default search engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brave Browser Github page|url=https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop|website=Github|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For factual [[question answering]], it is also queried by Apple's [[Siri (software)|Siri]], Samsung's [[S Voice]], as well as Dexetra's [[speech recognition]] software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform, Iris, and the voice control software on [[BlackBerry 10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berryreview.com/2013/10/21/blackberry-teams-up-with-wolfram-alpha-for-blackberry-10-voice-control/|title=BlackBerry Teams Up with Wolfram Alpha For BlackBerry 10 Voice Control|work=BerryReview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Launch preparations began on May 15, 2009 at 7&amp;nbsp;pm [[Central Daylight Time (North America)#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] and were broadcast live on [[Justin.tv]]. The plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later, with expected issues due to extreme load. The service was officially launched on May 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8052798.stm |title=Wolfram 'search engine' goes live |publisher=BBC News |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram Alpha has received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="spivack"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nova |last=Spivack |title=Wolfram Alpha is Coming – and It Could be as Important as Google |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.novaspivack.com/uncategorized/wolfram-alpha-is-coming-and-it-could-be-as-important-as-google |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Nova Spivack – Minding the Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singel |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Fails the Cool Test |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/wolframalpha-fails-the-cool-test/ |publisher=Wired |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram Alpha advocates point to its potential, some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness.&lt;ref name="spivack"/&gt;

On December 3, 2009, an [[iPhone]] app was introduced. Some users&lt;ref name="ios-price"&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/03/wolfram-alpha-iphone-app/ |title=Nice Try, Wolfram Alpha. Still Not Paying $50 For Your App. |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the initial $50 price of the [[iOS]] app unnecessarily high, since the same features could be freely accessed by using a web browser instead. They also complained about the simultaneous removal of the mobile formatting option for the site.&lt;ref name="mobile-format"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/03/wolframalpha-iphone-formatted-web-page-no-longer-available/ |first=TJ |last=Luoma |title=WolframAlpha iPhone-formatted web page no longer available |publisher=TUAW |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram responded by lowering the price to $2, offering a refund to existing customers&lt;ref name="refund"&gt;{{cite web|last=Broida |first=Rick |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10471978-233.html |title=Get Wolfram Alpha app for $1.99-and a refund if you paid more |publisher=CNET |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-instating the mobile site.

On October 6, 2010, an Android version of the app was released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/wolframalphas-android-app-now-available/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Android app now available |first=Leena |last=Rao |publisher=TechCrunch |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now available for Kindle Fire and Nook. (The Nook version is not available outside the US). A further 71 apps are available which use the Wolfram Alpha engine for specialized tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha: Mobile &amp; Tablet Apps |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Wolfram Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2018, the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version of Wolfram Alpha was released.&lt;ref name="Japanese version"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hideto |last=Tarai |title="WolframAlpha" which answers any difficult calculations and questions, the Japanese version is released |date=June 19, 2018 |url=https://forest.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1128271.html |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |publisher=Windows Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wolfram Alpha Pro ==
On February 8, 2012, Wolfram Alpha Pro was released,&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2012/02/08/announcing-wolframalpha-pro/ |title=Announcing Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Pro |date=February 8, 2012 |work=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering users additional features for a monthly subscription fee. A key feature is the ability to upload many common file types and data—including raw tabular data, images, audio, XML, and dozens of specialized scientific, medical, and mathematical formats—for automatic analysis. Other features include an extended keyboard, interactivity with [[Computable Document Format|CDF]], data downloads, in-depth step by step solution, the ability to customize and save graphical and tabular results&lt;ref name="Hachman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hachman |first=Mark |title=Data Geeks, Meet Wolfram Alpha Pro |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=February 7, 2012 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399911,00.asp |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extra computation time.&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt;

Along with new premium features, Wolfram Alpha Pro led to some changes in the free version of the site:
* An increase in advertisements on the free site.
* Text and PDF export options now require the user to set up a free account&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt; even though they existed before the introduction of Wolfram Alpha accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/06/24/users-guide-wolframalpha/|title=A User's Guide to Wolfram Alpha|first=Surfdaddy|last=Orca|publisher=H+ Magazine|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The option to request extra time for a long calculation is no longer available to free users.&lt;ref name="extra-time-before"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~jkmq53/school/Fall_2011/English_160/files/Marlowe_Usability_Test.docx|title=Wolfram Alpha Usability Test Survey|first=James|last=Marlowe|year=2011|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt;
* Step-by-step solving of math problems is limited to three steps for free users (previously uncapped). It has since been reduced to only one step with a preview of the second.&lt;ref name="StepByStep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/12/01/step-by-step-math/|title=Step-by-Step Math}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright claims ==
''[[InfoWorld]]'' published an article&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web |last=McAllister |first=Neil |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/how-wolfram-alpha-could-change-software-248 |title=How Wolfram Alpha could change software |publisher=InfoWorld |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning readers of the potential implications of giving an automated website proprietary rights to the data it generates. [[Free software movement|Free software]] advocate [[Richard Stallman]] also opposes the idea of recognizing the site as a copyright holder and suspects that Wolfram would not be able to make this case under existing copyright law.&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/2009-August/004865.html |title=How Wolfram Alpha's Copyright Claims Could Change Software |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-17 |mailinglist=Access 2 Knowledge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428041345/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/2009-August/004865.html |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
